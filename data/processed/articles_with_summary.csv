Here's CBA's latest Australian interest rate forecast,"Image source: Getty Images You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More If you've been hoping for another RBA interest rate cut this year, the economists at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) have some bad news for you. CBA revised its outlook for rate relief Down Under following yesterday's widely unexpected surge in inflation. News which sent the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) into a tailspin in early afternoon trade on Wednesday. The prospect of ASX 200 investors or Aussie mortgage holders seeing another 2025 interest rate cut from the RBA all but vanished yesterday after the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicator rose 1.3% in the September quarter and 3.2% annually. That marks the highest quarterly inflation increase since March 2023 and was well ahead of market expectations. The annual inflation print was the highest level since the June 2024 quarter. As for trimmed mean annual inflation, which removes certain volatile items and is the metric favoured by the RBA, it came in at 3% for the September quarter, up from 2.7% in the June quarter. This was the first time trimmed mean annual inflation rose since December 2022, and it came in well above the RBA's forecast of 2.6%. Which brings us to… Commenting on the surprise surge in inflation, Belinda Allen, head of Australian economics at CBA, said, ""This result will be a genuine concern for the RBA. We expect the central bank to take a more hawkish tone to avoid a return to higher inflation."" The RBA meets next week and announces its interest rate decision on Tuesday. As for that upcoming meeting, CBA said, ""We expect the cash rate to be held steady at 3.60%."" Unfortunately for ASX investors patiently waiting until 2026 for the next rate cuts, CBA also believes those are off the table for now. According to the ASX 200 bank: Given the material upside surprise to the Q3 25 CPI, and the broad-based nature of pricing pressures, we now expect the RBA to remain on hold from here. Previously we expected one last rate cut in February 2026 to bring the cash rate back closer to neutral. So, what will it take for Aussie to get some rate relief? ""We expect it would take a material move higher in the unemployment rate, together with more moderate inflation prints, to bring the RBA back to the cutting table,"" CBA said. Could, gasp, the next RBA interest rate move actually be higher? According to CBA, that's certainly a possibility, with the bank noting ""the latest data has tilted the risks to the upside"". CBA concluded, ""If inflation remains elevated in 2026, as we expect it could, the RBA may need to act.""",2025-10-30 04:39:40,Fool Australia,https://www.fool.com.au/2025/10/30/heres-cbas-latest-australian-interest-rate-forecast/,True,neutral,0,Us_Interest_Demand, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) revised its outlook for rate relief Down Under following yesterday's widely unexpected surge in inflation .

"Business : Xi Jinping Urges Partnership With Us, Says Frictions Are 'normal' Between Economic Powers","KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 30 (Bernama) -- China and the United States (US) should be partners and friends, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his meeting with his counterpart Donald Trump at the Gimhae Air Base in Busan, South Korea, while stating that it is normal for two economic powerhouses to have frictions at times. Trump called Xi a great leader, “President Xi is a great leader of a great country, and I think we are going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it is an honour to have you with us. Thank you very much.” Xi said, “China’s relations have remained stable on the whole (and) given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then and in the face of winds, waves and challenges.” “You and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course and ensure the steady sailing forward of the giant ship of China-US relations. I always believe that China’s development goes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again,” he said in the video that was streamed live by The White House. Xi said both leaders have spoken over the phone three times, exchanged several letters, and stayed in close contact since Trump’s re-election. He said both Beijing and Washington are fully able to help each other succeed and prosper together. “Over the years, I have stated in public many times that China and the US should be partners and friends. This is what history has taught us and what reality demands,” Xi said. Xi said that in the latest round of consultation, both economic and trade teams have reached a basic consensus on addressing respective major concerns and made encouraging progress. Earlier in his opening remarks, Trump also mentioned the consensus that has been reached. “I think we have already agreed to a lot of things, and we will agree to some more right now,” said Trump. Xi said the consensus provided the necessary conditions for their meeting today. He said, “Mr President, I am ready to continue working with you to build a solid foundation for China-US relations and create a sound atmosphere for the development of both countries.” Meanwhile, Trump also said Xi is a “very tough negotiator”, and a China-US trade deal could be signed between the two countries. Xi also expressed his appreciation for Trump’s contribution to the recent conclusion of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. “Mr President, you care a lot about world peace, and you are very enthusiastic about settling various regional hotspot issues. I appreciate your great contribution to the recent conclusion of the Gaza ceasefire agreement,” he said. The Chinese President also mentioned the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord, signed in Kuala Lumpur by Cambodia and Thailand. He said China has been helping, in its own way, for both countries to settle their border disputes, and that it has also been promoting peace talks to resolve other hotspot issues. “The world today is confronted with many tough problems. China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world,” he said. Both leaders are in South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Week, which is taking place in Gyeongju, a coastal city. Malaysia is a founding member of APEC, an intergovernmental forum comprising 21 economies. Collectively, the APEC economies contribute approximately 61 per cent of global gross domestic product and 46 per cent of world trade, underscoring their pivotal role in driving international economic growth and integration. With a population exceeding three billion, the APEC region continues to serve as a key engine of global development and is projected to expand by 2.9 per cent in 2026, reflecting its resilience and enduring economic potential. -- BERNAMA BERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.

All about glass bead art,"African glass bead art has been a part of cultural expression for centuries, combining traditional techniques with modern aesthetics.
This art form has evolved, yet retained its roots, showcasing the rich heritage and creativity of African artisans.
From intricate patterns to vibrant colors, glass bead art continues to captivate audiences worldwide.
Here are five fascinating aspects of this unique artistic tradition. #1 Glass beads have been a part of African culture since ancient times. They were used for trade, adornment, and spiritual purposes.
    The introduction of European-made glass beads in the 15th century revolutionized the industry, making them more accessible.
    Today, these beads are still used in traditional ceremonies and contemporary fashion alike. #2 The art of bead-making is passed down generations, with artisans perfecting their craft over the years.
    Traditional techniques include melting raw materials and shaping them into small spheres or tubes.
    Modern innovations have introduced new colors and shapes, but the basic methods remain largely unchanged. #3 Each design in African glass bead art carries cultural significance.
    Patterns may depict social status, tribal affiliation, or personal identity.
    Colors also have meanings; for example, red may symbolize strength, while blue could represent peace.
    Understanding these symbols adds depth to appreciating this art form. #4 The production and sale of glass beads provide a source of income for many communities across Africa.
    Artisans often work in cooperatives that support fair trade practices and sustainable development initiatives.
    The global demand for authentic African beadwork helps preserve this tradition while contributing to local economies. #5 In recent years, there has been a resurgence in popularity for African glass bead jewelry among fashion enthusiasts around the world.
    Designers are incorporating these vibrant pieces into modern wardrobes, highlighting their versatility as both statement accessories and subtle embellishments.
    This trend not only celebrates cultural heritage but also encourages ethical consumerism through supporting artisan communities.",2025-10-30 04:38:32,Newsbytes,https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/lifestyle/glass-bead-art-where-african-heritage-meets-contemporary-style/story,True,positive,2,Economic_Economies_Sustainable," African glass bead art has been a part of cultural expression for centuries, combining traditional techniques with modern aesthetics .

"Fed Meeting: Second Rate Cut Of The Year Announced, Benchmark Rates Lowered By 0.25%","The U.S. Federal Reserve just cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percent, which lines up with what most people on Wall Street expected. It's the second time they've trimmed rates this year, dropping the policy range to 3.75 to 4 percent. The vote wasn't unanimous either—out of twelve members, ten wanted this cut, one didn’t want any change, and another actually wanted an even bigger cut of 0.5 percent. The Fed didn’t give much of a hint about what they're planning for December. Back in September, they said there could be three more cuts in 2025, but for now, everyone’s waiting for the next meeting in December. After the announcement, markets bounced around—stocks jumped at first, then got shaky after the Fed Chair made his comments. So, what does the Fed say about the economy? In their official statement, they said things are still growing, but not too fast. Job growth is slowing down, and unemployment has ticked up a bit, though it’s still low. Inflation is higher than it was at the start of the year and isn’t coming down yet. The Fed keeps pointing to its two big goals: keeping unemployment low and hitting that 2 percent inflation target. Lately, with job risks creeping up, they decided a 0.25 percent rate cut was the right move to balance things out. They’re keeping a close eye on economic trends and global issues before making any more decisions. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke, markets got even more jittery. He said there’s a lot of disagreement inside the Fed about what to do in December, and it’s just too soon to say if there will be another cut this year. Stocks, which had gone up right after the rate cut, quickly lost those gains as investors digested his remarks. One more wrinkle: a government shutdown has held up a bunch of important economic reports. Even with some data missing, the Fed said they had enough information from both public and private sources to make the call. The shutdown has made it harder for agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect data. The White House warned that if this drags on, key inflation reports could be delayed, which could mess with how everyone judges the economy.",2025-10-30 04:38:10,The Free Press Journal,https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/fed-meeting-second-rate-cut-of-the-year-announced-benchmark-rates-lowered-by-025,True,neutral,0,Us_Interest_Demand," The U.S. Federal Reserve just cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percent .

"Asian Stocks Erase Gains After Trump-Xi Talks, Yen Falls: Markets Wrap","US equity-index futures erased gains and Asian shares lost momentum after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping ended their summit that was aimed at easing the trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Contracts for the S&P 500 were flat after the underlying gauge erased gains following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s warning that a rate cut in December isn’t a foregone conclusion. Asian shares gave up earlier gains to trade 0.1% lower. The technology sector remained in focus after Samsung Electronics Co.’s earnings beat estimates, and megacap US companies boosted bets on the artificial intelligence theme. The yen fluctuated against the dollar after the Bank of Japan held its policy rate. Gold was flat after four days of declines, while a gauge of the dollar trimmed gains from the prior session. Treasuries recouped some of their losses with the yield on the 10-year declining one basis point to 4.06%. Markets are looking past the Fed’s cautious stance on further rate cuts and turning their focus to the ongoing Trump–Xi meeting, which investors hope will ease the world’s largest trade dispute and steady global markets after months of tension. The artificial intelligence theme and spending by megacap companies were also in focus as big technology names started reporting earnings. Trump earlier said the US and China “could” sign a trade deal Thursday as the two leaders started a high-stakes meeting. The two leaders were set to finalise a détente at their South Korea meeting to put the world’s biggest trade fight on hold — at least for now. Earlier, following the Fed’s expected rate cut, Powell’s caution about future moves and his focus on labor market risks led investors to scale back easing bets. Fed officials delivered their second straight rate reduction Wednesday to support a softening labor market, and said they would stop shrinking the portfolio of assets on Dec. 1. Governor Stephen Miran dissented again in favor of a larger reduction. Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid said he preferred not to cut rates at all. Investors also got a chance to price in tech companies spending on artificial intelligence after earnings from megacaps. Three bellwethers – Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — together racked up some $78 billion in capital expenditures last quarter. That’s up 89% from a year earlier. Their earnings were mixed. Meta Platforms shares fell 7.4% in extended trading while Alphabet jumped 6.7%. Microsoft fell almost 4%. Earlier in the US trading day, Nvidia Corp. became the first company to reach $5 trillion in market valuation. “Even though the Fed communication was more hawkish than the market had expected, the news of Nvidia’s market cap exceeding $5 trillion and Alphabet’s favorable earnings announcement are supporting tech-related stocks in Asia,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. Some of the main moves in markets: S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% as of 1:16 p.m. Tokyo time Japan’s Topix rose 0.3% Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.5% Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.5% The Shanghai Composite was little changed Euro Stoxx 50 futures rose 0.2% The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1% The euro rose 0.2% to $1.1625 The Japanese yen was little changed at 152.74 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.0957 per dollar Bitcoin fell 1.4% to $109,904.42 Ether fell 1.8% to $3,881.47 The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 4.06% Japan’s 10-year yield was unchanged at 1.655% Australia’s 10-year yield advanced seven basis points to 4.29% West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.4% to $60.22 a barrel Spot gold rose 0.3% to $3,942.76 an ounce",2025-10-30 04:37:12,Ndtv Profit,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/global-stock-market-oct-30-check-hang-seng-nikkei-s-and-p-500-nasdaq-kospi-yen-dollar,True,neutral,0,Us_Interest_Demand," S&P 500 futures were flat after the underlying gauge erased gains following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s warning that a rate cut in December isn’t a foregone conclusion .

"‘Friction Is Natural, But Ties Must Stay On Track’: Xi Jinping Urges Trump For China-US Partnership","Chinese President Xi Jinping met his American counterpart Donald Trump in South Korea on Thursday, marking their first meeting in six years. During the talks, Xi emphasised that Beijing and Washington must remain partners and friends, acknowledging that differences were “natural” but urging both nations to stay on the “right course.” “It is natural to have friction,” Xi said, adding, “China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish more great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world.” He also expressed appreciation for Trump’s efforts to promote peace in ongoing global conflicts, reiterating China’s willingness to continue working with the United States. In response, President Trump described Xi as “a great leader of a great country,” adding, “I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it's an honour to have you with us.” The two leaders met at an air base in the southern port city of Busan, with the encounter taking place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. This was also the first meeting since Trump’s return to office in January this year. As the two leaders shook hands, Trump remarked, “We are going to have a very successful meeting, I have no doubt. But he is a very tough negotiator.” The meeting came against the backdrop of renewed US-China trade tensions, which have persisted since 2018. The dispute reignited earlier this month after China proposed expanding curbs on exports of rare-earth minerals, a key component for high-tech manufacturing where Beijing holds global dominance. In response, Trump announced plans to impose additional 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods and hinted at further restrictions on exports involving US software - a move that analysts warned could severely disrupt the global economy. Following urgent negotiations between senior officials, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Beijing might delay the rare-earth export restrictions for a year and resume purchases of US soybeans, a vital export for American farmers. Just ahead of the APEC Summit, Reuters reported that China had bought its first cargoes of US soybeans in several months, signalling tentative progress towards easing trade tensions.

Euro zone growth beats forecasts as France outperforms,"The euro zone economy grew quicker than expected last quarter as buoyant consumption offset faltering exports and persistent struggles in Germany's oversized industrial sector, fresh data from Eurostat showed on Thursday. The economy of the 20 nations sharing the euro expanded by 0.2% in the third quarter, beating expectations for a 0.1% increase in a Reuters poll, with France and Spain growing well above average, balancing out stagnation in Germany and Italy. On an annualised basis, the economy grew by 1.3%, ahead of expectations for 1.2%, a level economists consider to be around its natural rate of growth without stimulus. Spain remained the best performer among the bloc's largest economies, growing by 0.6% on the quarter, in line with forecasts, while France expanded by 0.5%, beating expectations for 0.2%. Germany and Italy meanwhile both stagnated. Thursday's figures ease pressure on the ECB to cut interest rates any further in the near term as they confirm the bank's long standing view that the economy is proving resilient to this year's unusual spike in uncertainty. While trade tensions, lingering uncertainty and Chinese dumping of surplus goods could still weigh on growth in the months ahead, economists remain relatively upbeat about the outlook and ECB projections suggest that last quarter may have been the worst for some time. Growth could pick up as past interest rate cuts work their way through the economy, households sit on ample saving, Germany boosts spending, uncertainty over tariffs eases and inventories have already run low. Indeed business activity, measured by a key purchasing managers survey, is already showing a pick up, sentiment in Germany, the bloc's biggest nation, is improving and business are becoming more optimistic, partly over lower tariff uncertainty. But any growth pick up is likely to be modest as the rigid structure of the euro zone economy limits activity, say economists, who predict growth in the 1.2% to 1.5% range for years to come.

Marcos leaves for APEC meet in South Korea,"(UPDATE) PRESIDENT Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday departed for South Korea to participate in the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ Meeting, where he will promote the Philippines and push for stronger regional trade and investment ties. Marcos left Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on board the presidential plane with first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos for the summit scheduled from Oct. 30 to Nov. 2 in Gyeongju, South Korea. In his departure statement, Marcos said the growth and stability of the Asia-Pacific region were directly tied to the opportunities and welfare of all Filipinos, as the region accounts for nearly 46 percent of global trade in goods and commercial services, and generates around 61 percent of global gross domestic product. “So, given these high stakes, this gathering is imperative. We convene at a critical juncture, defined by evolving geopolitical landscapes, supply chain disruptions, threats of climate change, and the urgent need for equitable and inclusive growth,” Marcos said. Citing the theme of this year’s APEC gathering, “Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect. Innovate. Prosper,” Marcos said the Philippines was committed to accelerate physical and digital connectivity, as well as digital transformation for competitiveness, and ensure stable and equitable prosperity for all Filipinos. “Our collaboration with the Republic of Korea and all APEC economies is pivotal. We will forge deeper ties around our shared goals and objectives, including fostering AI-driven innovation, enhancing cultural and creative industries, and proactively addressing demographic challenges,” the president said. “This collective resolve will ensure that our development efforts align with regional progress, laying the groundwork for a future where the power of creativity, technology and sustainability benefits every Filipino,” he added. Marcos said his engagements with the leaders of economies in the Asia-Pacific region would focus on “actionable areas” consistent with his administration’s long-term vision under AmBisyon 2040. He said these areas were guaranteeing equitable access to digital services and financial inclusion, particularly in underserved rural areas; advancing seamless movement of goods and people through investment facilitation and infrastructure development; promoting supply chain resiliency amid shocks and crises; and promoting digital literacy and skills development for micro, small and medium enterprises, women, and other segments who can realize their full economic potential through digitalization. The president said he was scheduled to address the APEC CEO Summit, an annual gathering of top CEOs in the region, where he would showcase the Philippines’ commitment to fostering economic partnerships and promoting a favorable business climate, aligned with the government’s vision of building a strong, innovation-driven economy. “Among others, we will highlight how we are pursuing digital transformation as a core pillar of our development, fully recognizing the potential of new technologies to unlock a more prosperous and resilient future,” said Marcos, who is heading to the APEC meetings after a four-day visit in Malaysia for the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Summit and Related Summits. Coming from the 47th Asean Summit, the president said he would lobby for stronger collaboration with regional partners, including Asean, to achieve the shared objectives for a sustainable, technologically empowered and inclusive future. “As the chair[man] of Asean in 2026, our goal is to impart that working silos impede the region’s potential. Real growth and lasting prosperity are achievable when we break down barriers, share knowledge, and collaborate across sectors, industries and communities,” he said. On the sidelines of the APEC meetings, President Marcos will meet with South Korean business leaders to deepen trade ties, attract investments and strengthen people-to-people cooperation. “I want to use this moment to reaffirm a core truth to the international business community: The Philippines is not merely ready. We are a reliable, forward-looking partner in the Asia-Pacific. Invest in the Filipino,” he said. Marcos also looked forward to meeting the Filipino community in Busan for the first time, where Filipinos thrive and make meaningful contributions to the city’s socioeconomic growth and further strengthen the enduring people-to-people ties between the Philippines and South Korea. Meanwhile, Marcos said that the ongoing meeting between United States President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would influence discussions at APEC, saying any agreement between the two economic powers would have global ripple effects. “The world is watching because this is the source of the largest shock that has entered into the world trade system. And we have to see what the agreements will be coming out of these meetings between President Xi and President Trump,” Marcos said. “Those will certainly color everything that we will be talking about in this APEC because the agreements or the arrangements that are made between two of the largest economies of the world will certainly affect every single citizen of the world,” he added. Trump kicked off a meeting with Xi at a South Korean air base on Thursday, optimistic about striking a trade-war truce between the world’s two largest economies. “We are going to have a very successful meeting, I have no doubt. But he is a very tough negotiator,” Trump said, as he shook hands with Xi. A few days ago, trade negotiators for both countries reached a “fundamental consensus on addressing each other’s primary concerns,” Xi said. “I am willing to continue working with President Trump to lay a solid foundation for China-US relations,” he added. During the president’s trip, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin will head the three-man government caretaker committee, with Agrarian Reform Secretary Conrado Estrella III and Education Secretary Sonny Angara as members. Part of Marcos’ delegation are Presidential Communications Acting Secretary Dave Gomez, Foreign Affairs Secretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro, Trade Secretary Cristina Roque, Migrant Workers Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac, Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick Go, and Palace Press Officer Claire Castro. Established in 1989, the regional economic forum aims to harness the growing interdependence of the Asia-Pacific region to promote greater prosperity for its people. Marcos’ attendance this year marks his return to the summit after skipping last year’s meeting in Peru to focus on the government’s disaster response efforts.",2025-10-30 04:48:12,The Manila Times,https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/10/30/news/marcos-leaves-for-apec-meet-in-south-korea/2211780,True,neutral,2,Economic_Economies_Sustainable, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. departed for South Korea to participate in the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ Meeting .

Giving stalling car industry a break on petrol-engine ban could be a mistake,"A law banning petrol and diesel engines in new cars by 2035, supposed to be one of the main planks of Europe’s ambitious green agenda, has become the latest front in a Brussels tug of war between climate and industrial policy. The law is part of the European Union’s efforts to become climate neutral by the middle of the century, by phasing out polluting cars and encouraging people to switch to greener electric vehicles (EVs). You will still be able to buy second-hand petrol or diesel cars after 2035, but new vehicles coming off the manufacturing lines will have to be battery-powered. The combustion engine ban, which was approved by the European Parliament and national governments two years ago, is in the sights of the stalling car industry. Volkswagen, BMW and other big German carmakers, which Berlin has rowed in behind, are looking for leeway on the deadline and specific carveouts. The fight cuts across several big questions policymakers are wrestling with: climate targets, the level of regulation from Brussels, Europe’s sluggish economy and the threat of China eating the EU’s lunch. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, whose “green deal” reforms introduced the 2035 engine ban during her first term at the helm of the EU’s powerful executive body, is under pressure to walk it back. The commission president has promised a review of the ban by the end of this year, which is expected to outline proposed changes. German chancellor Friedrich Merz is on a mission to strip back EU regulations he views as a burden on European industry. The plan to stop any new carbon dioxide-emitting cars being produced in 10 years is at the top of his list. There, he has a friend in Manfred Weber, the conservative German MEP who leads the European People’s Party (EPP), the centre-right grouping that dominates the European Parliament. Merz, Weber and von der Leyen all belong to the same political family in German politics, a home constituency the commission president can’t be seen to ignore. Definitely not when Germany’s industrial engine – the auto sector – is feeling the financial pinch and laying off workers. The review of the combustion engine ban will have to be a tidy piece of politics. Von der Leyen needs to give something to the car industry, but still hang on to the broad ambition of her legislation. That something might be scope for the car industry to keep producing hybrids, with both electric and combustion engines, beyond 2035, or a delay in the cut-off. Promising more help to car manufacturers developing their EV battery supply in Europe could be another sweetener. Giorgia Meloni’s hard-right Italian government has lined up beside Germany in opposition to the 2035 ban. The French and Spanish governments have been fighting a rearguard action in defence of the EU pivot to electric vehicles. A paper authored by France and Spain, circulated to diplomats in Brussels last week, said Europe didn’t stand a chance of hitting its climate targets if it failed to gradually get people to shift away from petrol and diesel cars. The paper, seen by The Irish Times, called for the review to “preserve the 2035 cap” and the environmental ambition behind it. The two big countries said that did not mean the auto industry could not be allowed some “flexibilities” to smooth its transition to EV production, but any leeway needed to be contingent on companies manufacturing their cars in Europe, not abroad. Ban or no ban, Europe is up against the clock to produce affordable electric vehicles. China is making moves to take over as much of the market as it can. Beijing has pumped huge amounts of state resources into industries it thinks will dominate the coming decades, from renewable energy to artificial intelligence and electric and self-driving vehicles. Trade hawks in the European Commission are concerned that China is halfway around the track and Europe is still lacing up its runners. The danger is that Chinese-made EVs, manufactured by say BYD, can seriously undercut European competitors on price, over time snuffing out domestic EV production here and leaving Europe reliant on China for its cars. Last year, the EU slapped defensive tariffs on imports of EVs from China to compensate for what the commission deemed to be an unfair leg-up Beijing gives its industry, which was allowing Chinese manufacturers to flood the European market. Pushing out the 2035 cut-off point for petrol and diesel engines might give European car manufacturers a break in the short term, but it won’t help them catch up to their Chinese rivals in the electric vehicle race.",2025-10-30 04:48:00,The Irish Times,https://www.irishtimes.com/world/europe/2025/10/30/giving-stalling-car-industry-a-break-on-petrol-engine-ban-could-be-a-mistake/,True,neutral,-1,Outlier," Law banning petrol and diesel engines in new cars by 2035 is latest front in Brussels tug of war .

Labor Slashes Regional Funding Again,"The Regional Development Victoria (RDV) annual report has revealed grants have been cut by $15 million, or 11 per cent, compared to the previous year. Four years ago, RDV had a total grants pool of $370 million to support development in the regions. Last year, it was just $118 million – a 70 per cent drop. But what is just as damning is the staffing wages bill at RDV. Employee expenses in the last financial year totalled $27.9 million – up 17 per cent from $23 million the previous year. To put it simply, regional Victorians are paying more for public servants, but getting less in return in development grants. Leader of The Nationals and Shadow Minister for Regional Development and Liveability, Danny O’Brien, said Labor is continuing to ignore regional Victorians. “The great divide continues. Labor is leaving regional Victorians out in the cold,” Mr O’Brien said. “It is impossible to justify a 70 per cent cut in grants for regional development across the past four years. “These grants are so important in supporting jobs, infrastructure and helping local economies flourish and thrive.” Mr O’Brien also questioned the staffing cost blow-out. “If RDV is delivering less grants and programs, why is it spending more in wages? Clearly, there’s less work to do,” Mr O’Brien said. “This is a double-edged sword. Regional Victorians are receiving less and paying more for the privilege because Labor can’t manage money.”",2025-10-30 04:47:44,The National Tribune,https://www.nationaltribune.com.au/labor-slashes-regional-funding-again/,True,negative,0,Us_Interest_Demand," Regional Development Victoria (RDV) annual report has revealed grants have been cut by $15 million, or 11 per cent, compared to the previous year .

"Trump, Xi talks wrap up with outcome unclear","China has agreed to keep rare earth exports flowing to the world as part of a one-year agreement, President Donald Trump said on Thursday shortly after meeting his counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea. The agreement, which Trump provided few details about except that it would probably be extended, would ""settle"" the issue, he said. China has yet to comment on what was agreed by the two leaders in talks, which ran for almost two hours. ""All of the rare earth has been settled,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. ""And that's for the world, worldwide, you could say this was a worldwide situation, not just a U.S. situation."" ""There is no roadblock at all on rare earth. That will hopefully disappear from our vocabulary for a little while."" Rare earths, 17 elements which play tiny but vital roles in cars, planes and weapons, have emerged from obscurity to become China's most potent source of leverage in its trade war with the United States. Export controls introduced in April caused widespread shortages overseas, especially for magnets, forcing some automakers to pause production before exports rebounded following deals between Beijing and Washington and the European Union to free up the flow. China expanded those controls again in October, taking the total number of elements restricted to 12 and adding much of the equipment used to process them. The expanded controls are set to come into force in early November and it is unclear whether the agreement discussed by Trump covers the full suite of China's rare earth export controls or just the October extension. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, also on the flight, said China would not be imposing its proposed rare earth controls after an understanding between the presidents. He did not comment on controls that are already in place.",2025-10-30 04:47:02,The Korea Times,https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/world/20251030/trump-xi-talks-wrap-up-with-outcome-unclear,True,neutral,1,Korea_Donald_Trump," Rare earths, 17 elements which play tiny but vital roles in cars, planes and weapons, have emerged from obscurity to become China's most potent source of leverage in its trade war with the United States .

Instant View: Market analysts react to Trump-Xi meeting,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump held talks with China's Xi Jinping at a South Korean air base on Thursday, with both leaders sounding optimistic about cooling trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. Market reaction was fairly muted as investors awaited further details of any agreement with Chinese stocks holding steady near a 10-year peak. Here are some comments from market analysts and investors: TARECK HORCHANI, HEAD OF DEALING, PRIME BROKERAGE, MAYBANK SECURITIES, SINGAPORE: ""The U.S.–China trade truce is likely to be greeted as a relief rally rather than a structural reset. When such truces occur, one of the first areas both sides highlight is agriculture, a politically sensitive sector in the U.S. where farmers form a key constituency. ""Overall, this looks like a tactical pause rather than a strategic breakthrough, with underlying tensions in technology, supply chains and rare earths still unresolved."" DICKIE WONG, HEAD OF RESEARCH, KINGSTON SECURITIES, HONG KONG: ""I don't see there's any major optimistic surprise at this point, both for the markets and the U.S.-China talks. It's still that same question - after the meeting ends, does it really mean the two countries will have a joint statement, and then the U.S. will roll back all tariffs on China, drop tech curbs, and China will export rare earths again? I don't see any possibility. ""The markets have already priced in much of the positives and there could be an 'anti-climax' development."" MUHAMMAD SAIFUDDIN BIN SAPUAN, ECONOMIST, KENANGA INVESTMENT BANK, KUALA LUMPUR: ""I think this is a tactical pause rather than a structural shift as both likely aim to ease tensions. But the truce will help stabilise global sentiment and trade expectations in the short term, which offers a relief for global demand and supply chain. ""Nevertheless, we still think that structural decoupling between the U.S. and China will continue to shape the long-term outlook.""
