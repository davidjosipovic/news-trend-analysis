Here's CBA's latest Australian interest rate forecast,"Image source: Getty Images You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More If you've been hoping for another RBA interest rate cut this year, the economists at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) have some bad news for you. CBA revised its outlook for rate relief Down Under following yesterday's widely unexpected surge in inflation. News which sent the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) into a tailspin in early afternoon trade on Wednesday. The prospect of ASX 200 investors or Aussie mortgage holders seeing another 2025 interest rate cut from the RBA all but vanished yesterday after the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicator rose 1.3% in the September quarter and 3.2% annually. That marks the highest quarterly inflation increase since March 2023 and was well ahead of market expectations. The annual inflation print was the highest level since the June 2024 quarter. As for trimmed mean annual inflation, which removes certain volatile items and is the metric favoured by the RBA, it came in at 3% for the September quarter, up from 2.7% in the June quarter. This was the first time trimmed mean annual inflation rose since December 2022, and it came in well above the RBA's forecast of 2.6%. Which brings us to… Commenting on the surprise surge in inflation, Belinda Allen, head of Australian economics at CBA, said, ""This result will be a genuine concern for the RBA. We expect the central bank to take a more hawkish tone to avoid a return to higher inflation."" The RBA meets next week and announces its interest rate decision on Tuesday. As for that upcoming meeting, CBA said, ""We expect the cash rate to be held steady at 3.60%."" Unfortunately for ASX investors patiently waiting until 2026 for the next rate cuts, CBA also believes those are off the table for now. According to the ASX 200 bank: Given the material upside surprise to the Q3 25 CPI, and the broad-based nature of pricing pressures, we now expect the RBA to remain on hold from here. Previously we expected one last rate cut in February 2026 to bring the cash rate back closer to neutral. So, what will it take for Aussie to get some rate relief? ""We expect it would take a material move higher in the unemployment rate, together with more moderate inflation prints, to bring the RBA back to the cutting table,"" CBA said. Could, gasp, the next RBA interest rate move actually be higher? According to CBA, that's certainly a possibility, with the bank noting ""the latest data has tilted the risks to the upside"". CBA concluded, ""If inflation remains elevated in 2026, as we expect it could, the RBA may need to act.""",2025-10-30 04:39:40,Fool Australia,neutral,0.6792,-1,Outlier, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) revised its outlook for rate relief following yesterday's widely unexpected surge in inflation .

"Business : Xi Jinping Urges Partnership With Us, Says Frictions Are 'normal' Between Economic Powers","KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 30 (Bernama) -- China and the United States (US) should be partners and friends, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his meeting with his counterpart Donald Trump at the Gimhae Air Base in Busan, South Korea, while stating that it is normal for two economic powerhouses to have frictions at times. Trump called Xi a great leader, “President Xi is a great leader of a great country, and I think we are going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it is an honour to have you with us. Thank you very much.” Xi said, “China’s relations have remained stable on the whole (and) given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then and in the face of winds, waves and challenges.” “You and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course and ensure the steady sailing forward of the giant ship of China-US relations. I always believe that China’s development goes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again,” he said in the video that was streamed live by The White House. Xi said both leaders have spoken over the phone three times, exchanged several letters, and stayed in close contact since Trump’s re-election. He said both Beijing and Washington are fully able to help each other succeed and prosper together. “Over the years, I have stated in public many times that China and the US should be partners and friends. This is what history has taught us and what reality demands,” Xi said. Xi said that in the latest round of consultation, both economic and trade teams have reached a basic consensus on addressing respective major concerns and made encouraging progress. Earlier in his opening remarks, Trump also mentioned the consensus that has been reached. “I think we have already agreed to a lot of things, and we will agree to some more right now,” said Trump. Xi said the consensus provided the necessary conditions for their meeting today. He said, “Mr President, I am ready to continue working with you to build a solid foundation for China-US relations and create a sound atmosphere for the development of both countries.” Meanwhile, Trump also said Xi is a “very tough negotiator”, and a China-US trade deal could be signed between the two countries. Xi also expressed his appreciation for Trump’s contribution to the recent conclusion of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. “Mr President, you care a lot about world peace, and you are very enthusiastic about settling various regional hotspot issues. I appreciate your great contribution to the recent conclusion of the Gaza ceasefire agreement,” he said. The Chinese President also mentioned the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord, signed in Kuala Lumpur by Cambodia and Thailand. He said China has been helping, in its own way, for both countries to settle their border disputes, and that it has also been promoting peace talks to resolve other hotspot issues. “The world today is confronted with many tough problems. China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world,” he said. Both leaders are in South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Week, which is taking place in Gyeongju, a coastal city. Malaysia is a founding member of APEC, an intergovernmental forum comprising 21 economies. Collectively, the APEC economies contribute approximately 61 per cent of global gross domestic product and 46 per cent of world trade, underscoring their pivotal role in driving international economic growth and integration. With a population exceeding three billion, the APEC region continues to serve as a key engine of global development and is projected to expand by 2.9 per cent in 2026, reflecting its resilience and enduring economic potential. -- BERNAMA BERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.

All about glass bead art,"African glass bead art has been a part of cultural expression for centuries, combining traditional techniques with modern aesthetics. This art form has evolved, yet retained its roots, showcasing the rich heritage and creativity of African artisans. From intricate patterns to vibrant colors, glass bead art continues to captivate audiences worldwide. Here are five fascinating aspects of this unique artistic tradition. #1 Glass beads have been a part of African culture since ancient times. They were used for trade, adornment, and spiritual purposes. The introduction of European-made glass beads in the 15th century revolutionized the industry, making them more accessible. Today, these beads are still used in traditional ceremonies and contemporary fashion alike. #2 The art of bead-making is passed down generations, with artisans perfecting their craft over the years. Traditional techniques include melting raw materials and shaping them into small spheres or tubes. Modern innovations have introduced new colors and shapes, but the basic methods remain largely unchanged. #3 Each design in African glass bead art carries cultural significance. Patterns may depict social status, tribal affiliation, or personal identity. Colors also have meanings; for example, red may symbolize strength, while blue could represent peace. Understanding these symbols adds depth to appreciating this art form. #4 The production and sale of glass beads provide a source of income for many communities across Africa. Artisans often work in cooperatives that support fair trade practices and sustainable development initiatives. The global demand for authentic African beadwork helps preserve this tradition while contributing to local economies. #5 In recent years, there has been a resurgence in popularity for African glass bead jewelry among fashion enthusiasts around the world. Designers are incorporating these vibrant pieces into modern wardrobes, highlighting their versatility as both statement accessories and subtle embellishments. This trend not only celebrates cultural heritage but also encourages ethical consumerism through supporting artisan communities.",2025-10-30 04:38:32,Newsbytes,neutral,0.567,22,Mikaev_So_And," Glass beads have been a part of African culture since ancient times .

"Fed Meeting: Second Rate Cut Of The Year Announced, Benchmark Rates Lowered By 0.25%","The U.S. Federal Reserve just cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percent, which lines up with what most people on Wall Street expected. It's the second time they've trimmed rates this year, dropping the policy range to 3.75 to 4 percent. The vote wasn't unanimous either—out of twelve members, ten wanted this cut, one didn’t want any change, and another actually wanted an even bigger cut of 0.5 percent. The Fed didn’t give much of a hint about what they're planning for December. Back in September, they said there could be three more cuts in 2025, but for now, everyone’s waiting for the next meeting in December. After the announcement, markets bounced around—stocks jumped at first, then got shaky after the Fed Chair made his comments. So, what does the Fed say about the economy? In their official statement, they said things are still growing, but not too fast. Job growth is slowing down, and unemployment has ticked up a bit, though it’s still low. Inflation is higher than it was at the start of the year and isn’t coming down yet. The Fed keeps pointing to its two big goals: keeping unemployment low and hitting that 2 percent inflation target. Lately, with job risks creeping up, they decided a 0.25 percent rate cut was the right move to balance things out. They’re keeping a close eye on economic trends and global issues before making any more decisions. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke, markets got even more jittery. He said there’s a lot of disagreement inside the Fed about what to do in December, and it’s just too soon to say if there will be another cut this year. Stocks, which had gone up right after the rate cut, quickly lost those gains as investors digested his remarks. One more wrinkle: a government shutdown has held up a bunch of important economic reports. Even with some data missing, the Fed said they had enough information from both public and private sources to make the call. The shutdown has made it harder for agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect data. The White House warned that if this drags on, key inflation reports could be delayed, which could mess with how everyone judges the economy.",2025-10-30 04:38:10,The Free Press Journal,negative,0.6795,27,September_About_December," The U.S. Federal Reserve just cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percent .

"Asian Stocks Erase Gains After Trump-Xi Talks, Yen Falls: Markets Wrap","US equity-index futures erased gains and Asian shares lost momentum after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping ended their summit that was aimed at easing the trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Contracts for the S&P 500 were flat after the underlying gauge erased gains following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s warning that a rate cut in December isn’t a foregone conclusion. Asian shares gave up earlier gains to trade 0.1% lower. The technology sector remained in focus after Samsung Electronics Co.’s earnings beat estimates, and megacap US companies boosted bets on the artificial intelligence theme. The yen fluctuated against the dollar after the Bank of Japan held its policy rate. Gold was flat after four days of declines, while a gauge of the dollar trimmed gains from the prior session. Treasuries recouped some of their losses with the yield on the 10-year declining one basis point to 4.06%. Markets are looking past the Fed’s cautious stance on further rate cuts and turning their focus to the ongoing Trump–Xi meeting, which investors hope will ease the world’s largest trade dispute and steady global markets after months of tension. The artificial intelligence theme and spending by megacap companies were also in focus as big technology names started reporting earnings. Trump earlier said the US and China “could” sign a trade deal Thursday as the two leaders started a high-stakes meeting. The two leaders were set to finalise a détente at their South Korea meeting to put the world’s biggest trade fight on hold — at least for now. Earlier, following the Fed’s expected rate cut, Powell’s caution about future moves and his focus on labor market risks led investors to scale back easing bets. Fed officials delivered their second straight rate reduction Wednesday to support a softening labor market, and said they would stop shrinking the portfolio of assets on Dec. 1. Governor Stephen Miran dissented again in favor of a larger reduction. Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid said he preferred not to cut rates at all. Investors also got a chance to price in tech companies spending on artificial intelligence after earnings from megacaps. Three bellwethers – Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — together racked up some $78 billion in capital expenditures last quarter. That’s up 89% from a year earlier. Their earnings were mixed. Meta Platforms shares fell 7.4% in extended trading while Alphabet jumped 6.7%. Microsoft fell almost 4%. Earlier in the US trading day, Nvidia Corp. became the first company to reach $5 trillion in market valuation. “Even though the Fed communication was more hawkish than the market had expected, the news of Nvidia’s market cap exceeding $5 trillion and Alphabet’s favorable earnings announcement are supporting tech-related stocks in Asia,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. Some of the main moves in markets: S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% as of 1:16 p.m. Tokyo time Japan’s Topix rose 0.3% Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.5% Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.5% The Shanghai Composite was little changed Euro Stoxx 50 futures rose 0.2% The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1% The euro rose 0.2% to $1.1625 The Japanese yen was little changed at 152.74 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.0957 per dollar Bitcoin fell 1.4% to $109,904.42 Ether fell 1.8% to $3,881.47 The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 4.06% Japan’s 10-year yield was unchanged at 1.655% Australia’s 10-year yield advanced seven basis points to 4.29% West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.4% to $60.22 a barrel Spot gold rose 0.3% to $3,942.76 an ounce",2025-10-30 04:37:12,Ndtv Profit,negative,0.6487,27,September_About_December," S&P 500 futures were flat after the underlying gauge erased gains following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s warning that a rate cut in December isn’t a foregone conclusion .

"‘Friction Is Natural, But Ties Must Stay On Track’: Xi Jinping Urges Trump For China-US Partnership","Chinese President Xi Jinping met his American counterpart Donald Trump in South Korea on Thursday, marking their first meeting in six years. During the talks, Xi emphasised that Beijing and Washington must remain partners and friends, acknowledging that differences were “natural” but urging both nations to stay on the “right course.” “It is natural to have friction,” Xi said, adding, “China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish more great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world.” He also expressed appreciation for Trump’s efforts to promote peace in ongoing global conflicts, reiterating China’s willingness to continue working with the United States. In response, President Trump described Xi as “a great leader of a great country,” adding, “I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it's an honour to have you with us.” The two leaders met at an air base in the southern port city of Busan, with the encounter taking place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. This was also the first meeting since Trump’s return to office in January this year. As the two leaders shook hands, Trump remarked, “We are going to have a very successful meeting, I have no doubt. But he is a very tough negotiator.” The meeting came against the backdrop of renewed US-China trade tensions, which have persisted since 2018. The dispute reignited earlier this month after China proposed expanding curbs on exports of rare-earth minerals, a key component for high-tech manufacturing where Beijing holds global dominance. In response, Trump announced plans to impose additional 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods and hinted at further restrictions on exports involving US software - a move that analysts warned could severely disrupt the global economy. Following urgent negotiations between senior officials, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Beijing might delay the rare-earth export restrictions for a year and resume purchases of US soybeans, a vital export for American farmers. Just ahead of the APEC Summit, Reuters reported that China had bought its first cargoes of US soybeans in several months, signalling tentative progress towards easing trade tensions.

Euro zone growth beats forecasts as France outperforms,"The euro zone economy grew quicker than expected last quarter as buoyant consumption offset faltering exports and persistent struggles in Germany's oversized industrial sector, fresh data from Eurostat showed on Thursday. The economy of the 20 nations sharing the euro expanded by 0.2% in the third quarter, beating expectations for a 0.1% increase in a Reuters poll, with France and Spain growing well above average, balancing out stagnation in Germany and Italy. On an annualised basis, the economy grew by 1.3%, ahead of expectations for 1.2%, a level economists consider to be around its natural rate of growth without stimulus. Spain remained the best performer among the bloc's largest economies, growing by 0.6% on the quarter, in line with forecasts, while France expanded by 0.5%, beating expectations for 0.2%. Germany and Italy meanwhile both stagnated. Thursday's figures ease pressure on the ECB to cut interest rates any further in the near term as they confirm the bank's long standing view that the economy is proving resilient to this year's unusual spike in uncertainty. While trade tensions, lingering uncertainty and Chinese dumping of surplus goods could still weigh on growth in the months ahead, economists remain relatively upbeat about the outlook and ECB projections suggest that last quarter may have been the worst for some time. Growth could pick up as past interest rate cuts work their way through the economy, households sit on ample saving, Germany boosts spending, uncertainty over tariffs eases and inventories have already run low. Indeed business activity, measured by a key purchasing managers survey, is already showing a pick up, sentiment in Germany, the bloc's biggest nation, is improving and business are becoming more optimistic, partly over lower tariff uncertainty. But any growth pick up is likely to be modest as the rigid structure of the euro zone economy limits activity, say economists, who predict growth in the 1.2% to 1.5% range for years to come.

Marcos leaves for APEC meet in South Korea,"(UPDATE) PRESIDENT Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday departed for South Korea to participate in the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ Meeting, where he will promote the Philippines and push for stronger regional trade and investment ties. Marcos left Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on board the presidential plane with first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos for the summit scheduled from Oct. 30 to Nov. 2 in Gyeongju, South Korea. In his departure statement, Marcos said the growth and stability of the Asia-Pacific region were directly tied to the opportunities and welfare of all Filipinos, as the region accounts for nearly 46 percent of global trade in goods and commercial services, and generates around 61 percent of global gross domestic product. “So, given these high stakes, this gathering is imperative. We convene at a critical juncture, defined by evolving geopolitical landscapes, supply chain disruptions, threats of climate change, and the urgent need for equitable and inclusive growth,” Marcos said. Citing the theme of this year’s APEC gathering, “Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect. Innovate. Prosper,” Marcos said the Philippines was committed to accelerate physical and digital connectivity, as well as digital transformation for competitiveness, and ensure stable and equitable prosperity for all Filipinos. “Our collaboration with the Republic of Korea and all APEC economies is pivotal. We will forge deeper ties around our shared goals and objectives, including fostering AI-driven innovation, enhancing cultural and creative industries, and proactively addressing demographic challenges,” the president said. “This collective resolve will ensure that our development efforts align with regional progress, laying the groundwork for a future where the power of creativity, technology and sustainability benefits every Filipino,” he added. Marcos said his engagements with the leaders of economies in the Asia-Pacific region would focus on “actionable areas” consistent with his administration’s long-term vision under AmBisyon 2040. He said these areas were guaranteeing equitable access to digital services and financial inclusion, particularly in underserved rural areas; advancing seamless movement of goods and people through investment facilitation and infrastructure development; promoting supply chain resiliency amid shocks and crises; and promoting digital literacy and skills development for micro, small and medium enterprises, women, and other segments who can realize their full economic potential through digitalization. The president said he was scheduled to address the APEC CEO Summit, an annual gathering of top CEOs in the region, where he would showcase the Philippines’ commitment to fostering economic partnerships and promoting a favorable business climate, aligned with the government’s vision of building a strong, innovation-driven economy. “Among others, we will highlight how we are pursuing digital transformation as a core pillar of our development, fully recognizing the potential of new technologies to unlock a more prosperous and resilient future,” said Marcos, who is heading to the APEC meetings after a four-day visit in Malaysia for the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Summit and Related Summits. Coming from the 47th Asean Summit, the president said he would lobby for stronger collaboration with regional partners, including Asean, to achieve the shared objectives for a sustainable, technologically empowered and inclusive future. “As the chair[man] of Asean in 2026, our goal is to impart that working silos impede the region’s potential. Real growth and lasting prosperity are achievable when we break down barriers, share knowledge, and collaborate across sectors, industries and communities,” he said. On the sidelines of the APEC meetings, President Marcos will meet with South Korean business leaders to deepen trade ties, attract investments and strengthen people-to-people cooperation. “I want to use this moment to reaffirm a core truth to the international business community: The Philippines is not merely ready. We are a reliable, forward-looking partner in the Asia-Pacific. Invest in the Filipino,” he said. Marcos also looked forward to meeting the Filipino community in Busan for the first time, where Filipinos thrive and make meaningful contributions to the city’s socioeconomic growth and further strengthen the enduring people-to-people ties between the Philippines and South Korea. Meanwhile, Marcos said that the ongoing meeting between United States President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would influence discussions at APEC, saying any agreement between the two economic powers would have global ripple effects. “The world is watching because this is the source of the largest shock that has entered into the world trade system. And we have to see what the agreements will be coming out of these meetings between President Xi and President Trump,” Marcos said. “Those will certainly color everything that we will be talking about in this APEC because the agreements or the arrangements that are made between two of the largest economies of the world will certainly affect every single citizen of the world,” he added. Trump kicked off a meeting with Xi at a South Korean air base on Thursday, optimistic about striking a trade-war truce between the world’s two largest economies. “We are going to have a very successful meeting, I have no doubt. But he is a very tough negotiator,” Trump said, as he shook hands with Xi. A few days ago, trade negotiators for both countries reached a “fundamental consensus on addressing each other’s primary concerns,” Xi said. “I am willing to continue working with President Trump to lay a solid foundation for China-US relations,” he added. During the president’s trip, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin will head the three-man government caretaker committee, with Agrarian Reform Secretary Conrado Estrella III and Education Secretary Sonny Angara as members. Part of Marcos’ delegation are Presidential Communications Acting Secretary Dave Gomez, Foreign Affairs Secretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro, Trade Secretary Cristina Roque, Migrant Workers Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac, Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick Go, and Palace Press Officer Claire Castro. Established in 1989, the regional economic forum aims to harness the growing interdependence of the Asia-Pacific region to promote greater prosperity for its people. Marcos’ attendance this year marks his return to the summit after skipping last year’s meeting in Peru to focus on the government’s disaster response efforts.",2025-10-30 04:48:12,The Manila Times,positive,0.6381,7,Tariffs_Trump_Cooperation, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. departed for South Korea to participate in the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ Meeting .

Giving stalling car industry a break on petrol-engine ban could be a mistake,"A law banning petrol and diesel engines in new cars by 2035, supposed to be one of the main planks of Europe’s ambitious green agenda, has become the latest front in a Brussels tug of war between climate and industrial policy. The law is part of the European Union’s efforts to become climate neutral by the middle of the century, by phasing out polluting cars and encouraging people to switch to greener electric vehicles (EVs). You will still be able to buy second-hand petrol or diesel cars after 2035, but new vehicles coming off the manufacturing lines will have to be battery-powered. The combustion engine ban, which was approved by the European Parliament and national governments two years ago, is in the sights of the stalling car industry. Volkswagen, BMW and other big German carmakers, which Berlin has rowed in behind, are looking for leeway on the deadline and specific carveouts. The fight cuts across several big questions policymakers are wrestling with: climate targets, the level of regulation from Brussels, Europe’s sluggish economy and the threat of China eating the EU’s lunch. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, whose “green deal” reforms introduced the 2035 engine ban during her first term at the helm of the EU’s powerful executive body, is under pressure to walk it back. The commission president has promised a review of the ban by the end of this year, which is expected to outline proposed changes. German chancellor Friedrich Merz is on a mission to strip back EU regulations he views as a burden on European industry. The plan to stop any new carbon dioxide-emitting cars being produced in 10 years is at the top of his list. There, he has a friend in Manfred Weber, the conservative German MEP who leads the European People’s Party (EPP), the centre-right grouping that dominates the European Parliament. Merz, Weber and von der Leyen all belong to the same political family in German politics, a home constituency the commission president can’t be seen to ignore. Definitely not when Germany’s industrial engine – the auto sector – is feeling the financial pinch and laying off workers. The review of the combustion engine ban will have to be a tidy piece of politics. Von der Leyen needs to give something to the car industry, but still hang on to the broad ambition of her legislation. That something might be scope for the car industry to keep producing hybrids, with both electric and combustion engines, beyond 2035, or a delay in the cut-off. Promising more help to car manufacturers developing their EV battery supply in Europe could be another sweetener. Giorgia Meloni’s hard-right Italian government has lined up beside Germany in opposition to the 2035 ban. The French and Spanish governments have been fighting a rearguard action in defence of the EU pivot to electric vehicles. A paper authored by France and Spain, circulated to diplomats in Brussels last week, said Europe didn’t stand a chance of hitting its climate targets if it failed to gradually get people to shift away from petrol and diesel cars. The paper, seen by The Irish Times, called for the review to “preserve the 2035 cap” and the environmental ambition behind it. The two big countries said that did not mean the auto industry could not be allowed some “flexibilities” to smooth its transition to EV production, but any leeway needed to be contingent on companies manufacturing their cars in Europe, not abroad. Ban or no ban, Europe is up against the clock to produce affordable electric vehicles. China is making moves to take over as much of the market as it can. Beijing has pumped huge amounts of state resources into industries it thinks will dominate the coming decades, from renewable energy to artificial intelligence and electric and self-driving vehicles. Trade hawks in the European Commission are concerned that China is halfway around the track and Europe is still lacing up its runners. The danger is that Chinese-made EVs, manufactured by say BYD, can seriously undercut European competitors on price, over time snuffing out domestic EV production here and leaving Europe reliant on China for its cars. Last year, the EU slapped defensive tariffs on imports of EVs from China to compensate for what the commission deemed to be an unfair leg-up Beijing gives its industry, which was allowing Chinese manufacturers to flood the European market. Pushing out the 2035 cut-off point for petrol and diesel engines might give European car manufacturers a break in the short term, but it won’t help them catch up to their Chinese rivals in the electric vehicle race.",2025-10-30 04:48:00,The Irish Times,neutral,0.5263,28,Next_Greener_Future," Law banning petrol and diesel engines in new cars by 2035 is latest front in Brussels tug of war .

Labor Slashes Regional Funding Again,"The Regional Development Victoria (RDV) annual report has revealed grants have been cut by $15 million, or 11 per cent, compared to the previous year. Four years ago, RDV had a total grants pool of $370 million to support development in the regions. Last year, it was just $118 million – a 70 per cent drop. But what is just as damning is the staffing wages bill at RDV. Employee expenses in the last financial year totalled $27.9 million – up 17 per cent from $23 million the previous year. To put it simply, regional Victorians are paying more for public servants, but getting less in return in development grants. Leader of The Nationals and Shadow Minister for Regional Development and Liveability, Danny O’Brien, said Labor is continuing to ignore regional Victorians. “The great divide continues. Labor is leaving regional Victorians out in the cold,” Mr O’Brien said. “It is impossible to justify a 70 per cent cut in grants for regional development across the past four years. “These grants are so important in supporting jobs, infrastructure and helping local economies flourish and thrive.” Mr O’Brien also questioned the staffing cost blow-out. “If RDV is delivering less grants and programs, why is it spending more in wages? Clearly, there’s less work to do,” Mr O’Brien said. “This is a double-edged sword. Regional Victorians are receiving less and paying more for the privilege because Labor can’t manage money.”",2025-10-30 04:47:44,The National Tribune,negative,0.7228,6,Executive_Government_Plans," Regional Development Victoria (RDV) annual report has revealed grants have been cut by $15 million, or 11 per cent, compared to the previous year .

"Trump, Xi talks wrap up with outcome unclear","China has agreed to keep rare earth exports flowing to the world as part of a one-year agreement, President Donald Trump said on Thursday shortly after meeting his counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea. The agreement, which Trump provided few details about except that it would probably be extended, would ""settle"" the issue, he said. China has yet to comment on what was agreed by the two leaders in talks, which ran for almost two hours. ""All of the rare earth has been settled,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. ""And that's for the world, worldwide, you could say this was a worldwide situation, not just a U.S. situation."" ""There is no roadblock at all on rare earth. That will hopefully disappear from our vocabulary for a little while."" Rare earths, 17 elements which play tiny but vital roles in cars, planes and weapons, have emerged from obscurity to become China's most potent source of leverage in its trade war with the United States. Export controls introduced in April caused widespread shortages overseas, especially for magnets, forcing some automakers to pause production before exports rebounded following deals between Beijing and Washington and the European Union to free up the flow. China expanded those controls again in October, taking the total number of elements restricted to 12 and adding much of the equipment used to process them. The expanded controls are set to come into force in early November and it is unclear whether the agreement discussed by Trump covers the full suite of China's rare earth export controls or just the October extension. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, also on the flight, said China would not be imposing its proposed rare earth controls after an understanding between the presidents. He did not comment on controls that are already in place.",2025-10-30 04:47:02,The Korea Times,positive,0.8266,55,2026_International_Agreement," Rare earths, 17 elements which play tiny but vital roles in cars, planes and weapons, have emerged from obscurity to become China's most potent source of leverage in its trade war with the United States .

Market reaction was fairly muted as investors awaited further details of any agreement with Chinese stocks holding steady near a 10-year peak. Here are some comments from market analysts and investors: TARECK HORCHANI, HEAD OF DEALING, PRIME BROKERAGE, MAYBANK SECURITIES, SINGAPORE: ""The U.S.–China trade truce is likely to be greeted as a relief rally rather than a structural reset. When such truces occur, one of the first areas both sides highlight is agriculture, a politically sensitive sector in the U.S. where farmers form a key constituency. ""Overall, this looks like a tactical pause rather than a strategic breakthrough, with underlying tensions in technology, supply chains and rare earths still unresolved."" DICKIE WONG, HEAD OF RESEARCH, KINGSTON SECURITIES, HONG KONG: ""I don't see there's any major optimistic surprise at this point, both for the markets and the U.S.-China talks. It's still that same question - after the meeting ends, does it really mean the two countries will have a joint statement, and then the U.S. will roll back all tariffs on China, drop tech curbs, and China will export rare earths again? I don't see any possibility. ""The markets have already priced in much of the positives and there could be an 'anti-climax' development."" MUHAMMAD SAIFUDDIN BIN SAPUAN, ECONOMIST, KENANGA INVESTMENT BANK, KUALA LUMPUR: ""I think this is a tactical pause rather than a structural shift as both likely aim to ease tensions. But the truce will help stabilise global sentiment and trade expectations in the short term, which offers a relief for global demand and supply chain. ""Nevertheless, we still think that structural decoupling between the U.S. and China will continue to shape the long-term outlook.""

5-year wait ends: Bengaluru’s delayed Hosakerehalli flyover finally set to open in November,"The long-delayed Hosakerehalli flyover on Outer Ring Road (ORR), near PES College in southwest Bengaluru, is finally nearing completion and is expected to open to traffic by mid-November. The 500-metre structure was planned to ease congestion at one of the city’s busiest junctions but has faced repeated delays since its launch. The project began in August 2020 with an initial deadline of just 15 months. However, more than five years, around 64 months have passed since then. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) faced criticism for the prolonged delay, prompting the recently formed Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) to issue a 15-day ultimatum for completion, as per a report by Times of India (TOI).

Trump cuts China tariffs to 47pc after ‘amazing’ Xi meeting,"BUSAN, Oct 30 — US President Donald Trump said today he had agreed to reduce tariffs on China to 47 per cent in exchange for Beijing resuming US soybean purchases, keeping rare earths exports flowing and cracking down on the illicit trade of fentanyl. His remarks after face-to-face talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the South Korean city of Busan, their first since 2019, marked the finale of Trump’s whirlwind Asia trip on which he also touted trade breakthroughs with South Korea, Japan and South-east Asian nations. “I thought it was an amazing meeting,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One shortly after he departed Busan, adding that tariffs imposed on Chinese imports would be cut to 47 per cent from 57 per cent. Trading in global stocks was choppy as Trump revealed details of the deal, with major Asian indexes and European futures swinging between gains and losses. China’s Shanghai Composite Index slipped from a 10-year high, while US soybean futures were weaker. World stock markets from Wall Street to Tokyo had hit record highs leading up to the meeting on hopes of a breakthrough in a trade war between the world’s two largest economies that has upended supply chains and rocked global business confidence. The meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, lasted nearly two hours. Trump shook hands and escorted Xi to his car before the US president was given a red-carpet send-off at the airport. Trump repeatedly talked up the prospect of reaching agreement with Xi since US negotiators on Sunday said they had agreed a framework with China that will avoid 100 per cent US tariffs on Chinese goods and achieve a deferral of China’s export curbs on rare earths, a sector it dominates. But with both countries increasingly willing to play hardball over areas of economic and geopolitical competition, many questions remain about how long any trade detente may last. — Reuters",2025-10-30 05:22:52,Malay Mail,positive,0.917,7,Tariffs_Trump_Cooperation," US President Donald Trump said he had agreed to reduce tariffs on China to 47 per cent in exchange for Beijing resuming US soybean purchases, keeping rare earths exports flowing and cracking down on the illicit trade of fentanyl .

Alausa’s skills-focused agenda gets support,"Education October 30, 2025 by Bola Olajuwon and Victoria Amadi The Minister of Education, Dr. Maruf Tunji Alausa, has embarked on a comprehensive overhaul of the country’s education system since he took over the ministry, moving from the traditional structure towards a skills-focused curriculum and a sustainable education model. A major part of the reforms is the restructuring of the national curriculum for basic, senior secondary and technical education, which commenced this academic year. The ministry had also added new vocational and trade subjects to the curriculum, including digital literacy, solar installation, agricultural entrepreneurship, and garment making. This is intended to entrench practical skills from an early age and prepare students for the demands of the modern job market. According to the minister, the total number of subjects a student would offer would be streamlined across different grade levels to reduce “content overload” and enable deeper learning. The government has converted federal science and technical colleges into modern technical colleges. This includes free tuition and stipends for students, with a curriculum that is 80 per cent practical and 20 per cent theoretical. Alausa has also emphasised the need for ongoing education reforms to move beyond policy declarations and deliver practical outcomes that strengthen skills, innovation, and job creation among young people. According to him, the ultimate goal of the reforms is to ensure that students are not only educated but also equipped with the competencies required to thrive in a fast-changing global economy. He explained that the Federal Government was working to align education with the needs of the labour market through curriculum review, improved teacher training, and investment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. READ ALSO: Why petrol prices are high despite cheaper crude The minister, at the National Education Group (NEG) Meeting in Abuja, noted that the future of the country depended on how well its education system produced citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. Alausa said: “Our reforms must go beyond the paperwork of policy; they must impact classrooms, teachers, and ultimately the learners. Education should not end with certificates but open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity.” According to him, the ministry is prioritising partnerships with the private sector and development agencies to expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research, and digital learning. “If we are to build a competitive economy, we must invest in the skills and knowledge base of our young people so that they can become drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added. The NEG Meeting brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including policymakers, education administrators, academics, and development partners, to deliberate on strategies for improving education delivery and learning outcomes across all levels. Participants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector. During the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population. He added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole. CONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities The President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction. Sunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform. However, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation. Reiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective. He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” A major part of the reforms is the restructuring of the national curriculum for basic, senior secondary and technical education, which commenced this academic year.

However, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation. Reiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective. He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” The government has converted federal science and technical colleges into modern technical colleges. This includes free tuition and stipends for students, with a curriculum that is 80 per cent practical and 20 per cent theoretical. Alausa has also emphasised the need for ongoing education reforms to move beyond policy declarations and deliver practical outcomes that strengthen skills, innovation, and job creation among young people. According to him, the ultimate goal of the reforms is to ensure that students are not only educated but also equipped with the competencies required to thrive in a fast-changing global economy. He explained that the Federal Government was working to align education with the needs of the labour market through curriculum review, improved teacher training, and investment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.

Alausa said: “Our reforms must go beyond the paperwork of policy; they must impact classrooms, teachers, and ultimately the learners. Education should not end with certificates but open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity.” According to him, the ministry is prioritising partnerships with the private sector and development agencies to expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research, and digital learning. “If we are to build a competitive economy, we must invest in the skills and knowledge base of our young people so that they can become drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added. The NEG Meeting brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including policymakers, education administrators, academics, and development partners, to deliberate on strategies for improving education delivery and learning outcomes across all levels. Participants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector. During the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population. He added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole.

He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” The minister, at the National Education Group (NEG) Meeting in Abuja, noted that the future of the country depended on how well its education system produced citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. Alausa said: “Our reforms must go beyond the paperwork of policy; they must impact classrooms, teachers, and ultimately the learners. Education should not end with certificates but open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity.” According to him, the ministry is prioritising partnerships with the private sector and development agencies to expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research, and digital learning. “If we are to build a competitive economy, we must invest in the skills and knowledge base of our young people so that they can become drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added. The NEG Meeting brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including policymakers, education administrators, academics, and development partners, to deliberate on strategies for improving education delivery and learning outcomes across all levels. Participants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector. During the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population. He added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole. CONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities The President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction. Sunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform. However, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation. Reiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective. He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track.

There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” Participants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector. During the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population. He added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole. CONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities The President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction. Sunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform. However, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation. Reiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective. He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more.

He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” Reiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective. He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said.

Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted.

"The Grand Egyptian Museum showcasing 50,000 artifacts is finally opening","CAIRO: After two decades of anticipation and countless delays, the Grand Egyptian Museum is finally having its grand reveal. The museum, which is set to officially open Saturday, highlights Egypt’s ancient civilization and is a centerpiece of the government’s drive to boost the tourist industry, a major source of foreign currency in the cash-strapped country. Located just outside Cairo next to the famed Giza Pyramids, the $1 billion mammoth facility is poised to become the world’s largest museum dedicated to a single civilization with over 50,000 artifacts detailing the life in ancient Egypt. By comparison, the Louvre Museum in Paris has about 35,000 pieces on display. The museum is one of the mega-projects championed by President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, who since taking office in 2014 embarked on massive investments in infrastructure with the aim of reviving an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered by the unrest that followed the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. The museum’s construction began in 2005, but work stopped for three years during the political turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising. The grand opening was postponed multiple times, most recently in July this year because of conflicts in the Middle East. World leaders are expected to attend the opening ceremony Saturday. Giant building with a view of the Giza Pyramids Designed by the Irish firm Heneghan Peng Architects, the museum, known as GEM, boasts a towering, triangular glass façade imitating the nearby pyramids. In its entrance atrium stands the granite colossus of one of Egypt’s most famed pharaohs, Ramesses the Great. The 3,200-year-old, 11-meters-tall (36-foot-tall) statue was moved to the museum after decades of standing in the center of a traffic-clogged roundabout in front of Cairo’s main train station. From the atrium, a grand six-story staircase lined with ancient statues leads up to the main galleries and a view of the nearby pyramids. A bridge links the museum to the pyramids, allowing tourists to move between them either on foot or via electric, environment-friendly vehicles, according to museum officials. The museum includes 24,000 square meters (258,000 square feet) of permanent exhibition space, a children’s museum and conference and educational facilities, and a commercial area as well as a large conservation center. The 12 main galleries, which opened last year, exhibit antiquities spanning from prehistoric times to the Roman era, organized by era and by themes. Many of the 50,000 artifacts in the GEM were moved from the Egyptian Museum, a packed, century-old building in downtown Cairo’s Tahrir Square. Others were recently unearthed from ancient cemeteries, including the Saqqara necropolis, another complex of pyramids and tombs about 14 miles (22 kilometers) south of the museum. The halls are equipped with advanced technology and feature multimedia presentations including mixed-reality shows to help explain ancient Egypt to new generations, said Ahmed Ghoneim, the museum’s CEO. “We’re using the language that the Gen Z uses right now,” he said in an interview. “Gen Z doesn’t use anymore the labels that we read as old people but rather use technology.” Tutankhamun collection in one place for the first time Saturday’s grand opening will include the inauguration of two halls dedicated to the 5,000 artifacts from the collection of King Tutankhamun. The collection is being displayed in its entirety for the first time since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered King Tut’s tomb in 1922 in the southern city of Luxor. The old Egyptian Museum didn’t have enough space to show all the tomb’s treasures at once. Some masterpieces were restored at the museum’s conservation center, including the boy pharaoh’s three funeral beds and six chariots, said Jailan Mohamed, chief restorer at the conservation center. They will be displayed along with his golden throne, his gold-covered sarcophagus and his burial mask, made of gold, quartzite, lapis lazuli and colored glass. The mask’s beard was accidentally knocked off and hastily glued back on with epoxy in 2014, before a German-Egyptian team of experts fixed it the following year. Another centerpiece of the museum is the 4,600-year-old solar boat of King Khufu, the pharaoh who is credited with building the Great Pyramid of Giza. The 43-meter-long (140-foot) wooden boat, discovered in the 1950s, was buried next to the Great Pyramid for Khufu — or Cheops as he is also known — to use in the afterlife. In 2021, it was moved from its display site by the pyramids into the Grand Egyptian Museum on a remote-controlled vehicle imported from Belgium. The government hopes that the museum will revitalize tourism The government hopes the museum will draw more tourists who will stay for a while and provide the foreign currency Egypt needs to shore up its economy. The tourism sector suffered from years of political turmoil and violence following the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. In recent years, the sector has started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the effects of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine are a major source of tourists visiting Egypt. A record number of 15.7 million visited the country in 2024, according to official figures, and the government aims to attract 30 million visitors by 2032. Authorities overhauled the whole area around the museum and the pyramids. Roads were paved and a metro station is being constructed outside the museum gates to ease access to the sites. An airport, Sphinx International Airport, was also opened west of Cairo — 40 minutes from the museum. Hassan Allam, CEO of Hassan Allam Holding, the firm administering the museum, said they’re expecting between 15,000 and 20,000 visitors a day at the museum. “The world has been waiting … Everyone’s excited,” he said.",2025-10-30 05:21:41,Arab News Pk,positive,0.7555,51,Decades_Treasures_Guggenheim," The Grand Egyptian Museum is poised to become the world’s largest museum dedicated to a single civilization .

Trump says tariffs on China are dropping from 57% to 47% after talks on fentanyl curbs with Xi Jinping,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump described his face-to-face with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday as a roaring success, saying he would cut tariffs on China, while Beijing had agreed to allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans. The president told reporters aboard Air Force One that the U.S. would lower tariffs implemented earlier this year as punishment on China for its selling of chemicals used to make fentanyl from 20% to 10%. That brings the total combined tariff rate on China down from 57% to 47% “I guess on the scale from 0 to 10, with ten being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,” Trump said. “I think it was a 12.” Trump said that he would go to China in April and Xi would come to the U.S. “some time after that.” The president said they also discussed the export of more advanced computer chips to China, saying that Nvidia would be in talks with Chinese officials. Trump said he could sign a trade deal with China “pretty soon.” Xi said Washington and Beijing would work to finalize their agreements to provide “peace of mind” to both countries and the rest of the world, according to a report on the meeting distributed by state media. “Both sides should take the long-term perspective into account, focusing on the benefits of cooperation rather than falling into a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation,” he said. Despite Trump’s optimism after a 100-minute meeting with Xi in South Korea, there continues to be the potential for major tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Both nations are seeking dominant places in manufacturing, developing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and shaping world affairs like Russia’s war in Ukraine. Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs since returning to the White House for a second term, combined with China’s retaliatory limits on exports of rare earth elements, gave the meeting newfound urgency. There is a mutual recognition that neither side wants to risk blowing up the world economy in ways that could jeopardize their own country’s fortunes. When the two were seated at the start of the meeting, Xi read prepared remarks that stressed a willingness to work together despite differences. “Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other,” he said through a translator. “It is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then.” There was a slight difference in translation as China’s Xinhua News Agency reported Xi as telling Trump that having some differences is inevitable. The leaders met in Busan, South Korea, a port city about 76 kilometers (47 miles) south from Gyeongju, the main venue for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. In the days leading up to the meeting, U.S. officials signaled that Trump did not intend to make good on a recent threat to impose an additional 100% import tax on Chinese goods, and China showed signs it was willing to relax its export controls on rare earths and also buy soybeans from America. Officials from both countries met earlier this week in Kuala Lumpur to lay the groundwork for their leaders. Afterward, China’s top trade negotiator Li Chenggang said they had reached a “preliminary consensus,” a statement affirmed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who said there was “ a very successful framework.” Shortly before the meeting on Thursday, Trump posted on Truth Social that the meeting would be the “G2,” a recognition of America and China’s status as the world’s biggest economies. The Group of Seven and Group of 20 are other forums of industrialized nations. But while those summits often happen at luxury spaces, this meeting took place in humbler surroundings: Trump and Xi met in a small gray building with a blue roof on a military base adjacent to Busan’s international airport. The anticipated detente has given investors and businesses caught between the two nations a sense of relief. The U.S. stock market has climbed on the hopes of a trade framework coming out of the meeting. Pressure points remain for both US and China Trump has outward confidence that the grounds for a deal are in place, but previous negotiations with China this year in Geneva, Switzerland and London had a start-stop quality to them. The initial promise of progress has repeatedly given way to both countries seeking a better position against the other. “The proposed deal on the table fits the pattern we’ve seen all year: short-term stabilization dressed up as strategic progress,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “Both sides are managing volatility, calibrating just enough cooperation to avert crisis while the deeper rivalry endures.” The U.S. and China have each shown they believe they have levers to pressure the other, and the past year has demonstrated that tentative steps forward can be short-lived. For Trump, that pressure comes from tariffs. China had faced new tariffs this year totaling 30%, of which 20% were tied to its role in fentanyl production. But the tariff rates have been volatile. In April, he announced plans to jack the rate on Chinese goods to 145%, only to abandon those plans as markets recoiled. Then, on Oct. 10, Trump threatened a 100% import tax because of China’s rare earth restrictions. That figure, including past tariffs, would now be 47% “effective immediately,” Trump told reporters on Thursday. Xi has his own chokehold on the world economy because China is the top producer and processor of the rare earth minerals needed to make fighter jets, robots, electric vehicles and other high-tech products. China had tightened export restrictions on Oct. 9, repeating a cycle in which each nation jockeys for an edge only to back down after more trade talks. What might also matter is what happens directly after their talks. Trump plans to return to Washington, while Xi plans to stay on in South Korea to meet with regional leaders during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which officially begins on Friday. “Xi sees an opportunity to position China as a reliable partner and bolster bilateral and multilateral relations with countries frustrated by the U.S. administration’s tariff policy,” said Jay Truesdale, a former State Department official who is CEO of TD International, a risk and intelligence advisory firm. ___ Ken Moritsugu in Beijing and Seung Min Kim and Michelle Price in Washington contributed to this report.

Florence Press Conference Confirms ECB Remains Comfortable in Its Good Place,"Even a change of scenery has done nothing to change the European Central Bank’s current wait-and-see stance. Florence, where the ECB met today for its only annual meeting outside of Frankfurt, is apparently also this ’good place’, the central bank’s well-known pseudonym for comfortably keeping interest rates on hold. ECB President Christine Lagarde even called it a ‘magnificent’ place – Florence, that is, not rates. The comments at the press conference confirmed once again that the ECB has no intention to leave its ‘good place’ any time soon. We had feared a rather uneventful press conference. What should we say? We hate to be right… Anyhow, here are a few interesting remarks made by Lagarde: On the ECB’s risk assessment, the introductory statement had the most remarkable change compared with September. Last month, the ECB had still talked about risks to the growth outlook that had become “more balanced”; today, it refrained from qualifying any balance of risk. Instead, the central bank had a somewhat more extensive list of upside and downside risks to the growth outlook. Lagarde even said that some of the downside risks had abated. When asked whether this was a sign of an upcoming shift in the balance of risk, the ECB’s President pointed out that it had already narrowed the risks at the September meeting. Funnily enough, back at the September meeting, there had been no mention of a narrowing of risks. Supply chain disruptions. Lagarde referred to a discussion on potential supply chain bottlenecks that could still arise as a result of the latest tensions between China and the EU on microchips and rare earths in general. Risks to inflation. As in the past, the ECB didn’t provide an assessment of the balance of risks to inflation. However, during the press conference, Lagarde mentioned different positions, views and analyses regarding inflation within the Governing Council. These differing views do exist, despite a unanimous decision to keep rates on hold today. A particular concern remains service inflation, which the ECB has often labelled as being too high. Looking ahead, today’s meeting has done nothing to change the view that the bar for yet another rate cut from the ECB is high. In fact, the Bank currently feels very comfortable in its ‘good place’. With the ECB’s own growth forecasts indicating that the eurozone economy will grow by slightly more than 1% each year and inflation will settle down to 2% over the next few years, there is indeed very little reason to change its monetary policy stance. At the same time, there are still valid dovish arguments that could force the central bank to cut again at the December meeting. Just think of the delayed adverse impact of US tariffs, the stronger euro exchange rate, French politics or a delay in Germany’s fiscal stimulus. If any of these downside risks materialise, we can expect the ECB to engage in one or two more rate cuts. On this point, it remains important to note that the current ECB inflation forecast for 2027 includes a 0.2ppt impact from the introduction of the ETS2 system. Needless to say, any delay in the implementation could have implications for the ECB as it would increase the risk of inflation undershooting. Even if Lagarde tried to downplay this issue during the press conference. In any case, even if the ECB seems to rest more comfortably on its laurels than before, the December staff projections will be crucial and could still invade its good place. If the 2028 inflation forecasts come in sub-1.7%, the likelihood of yet another rate cut would increase. More generally speaking, Lagarde didn’t give away any hints at what’s next for the ECB. Maybe the strongest message came from the colours of the President’s scarf, which – at least to us – resembled the French flag. For the rest, today’s meeting was another illustration that the ECB has no intention whatsoever of leaving its ‘good place’ any time soon. *** Disclaimer: This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user’s means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Glen Burnie Bancorp Announces Third Quarter 2025 Results,"Highlights for the Third Quarter of 2025: Year-to-date through September 30, 2025, net earnings were $66,000 compared to a net loss of $72,000 during the same nine-month period in 2024. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2025 was $0.02, compared to a diluted loss per share of $(0.02) during the same period in 2024. ""We are pleased with our results for this quarter as our strategic initiatives that were started over a year ago, continue to improve our balance sheet position and earnings. We are also excited to complete the acquisition of VAWM as we believe that our new subsidiary will help grow our non-interest income, increase our ability to serve new markets, and add a cornerstone product to our expanding line of products and services,” said Mark C. Hanna, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our strategic priorities continue to focus on increasing new revenue sources by growing our client relationships and becoming more operationally efficient. Achieving these objectives will expand our return on assets and capital.” Mr. Hanna added, ""We were also very pleased to see that our deposit base and cost of funding continues to remain competitive and stable while seeing good growth in our loan revenues. With strong liquidity and ample capital, we are very excited about our future and the benefits our strategic initiatives are beginning to produce.” Loan Portfolio Quality/Allowance for Loan Losses The Bank’s asset quality metrics continue to be very good due to our focus on disciplined lending practices. The non-performing loans ratio as of September 30, 2025, was 0.56%, up 40 basis points from the third quarter 2024 and up slightly by 5 basis points from June 30, 2025. During the third quarter of 2025, the Bank had net charge-offs of $93,000 or 0.17% to average loans, as compared to net recoveries of $44,000 or -0.09% in the third quarter 2024, and net charge-offs of $45,000 or 0.09% in the second quarter of 2025. Provision expense was $44,000 in the third quarter 2025 compared to $105,000 for the third quarter 2024, and $79,000 in the second quarter 2025. The Bank’s allowance for loan losses to loans was 1.19% for the third quarter 2025, a decline of 0.02% from the second quarter of 2025 and a decline of 0.14% from the third quarter of 2024. Mr. Hanna noted, ""We continue to see and experience very good credit results and indicators in our markets, while our non-performing assets remain at lower levels. Our allowance for credit losses at 1.19% of loans, highlights our conservative stance on maintaining a healthy reserve on our balance sheet.” Balance Sheet Total loans were $215.3 million at September 30, 2025, an increase of $8.3 million, or 4.0%, from the third quarter of 2024, and $2.0 million from the second quarter of 2025. During the third quarter 2025, total average loans increased $7.3 million from the second quarter 2025 as a result of growth in commercial real estate loans of $2.4 million, $3.8 million of growth in the C&I portfolio, and a $1.1 million increase in consumer loans (automobile). Total deposits were $329.1 million at September 30, 2025, an increase of $14.8 million, or 4.7%, from the third quarter of 2024, and $11.8 million from the second quarter of 2025. Non-interest-bearing deposits, which are 33% of total deposits, were down by $8.6 million, or 7.4%, from the third quarter of 2024, and were relatively unchanged from the second quarter of 2025. Interest-bearing deposits ended at $221.7 million for the third quarter of 2025, a $23.4 million increase from the third quarter 2024, or 11.8%, and an increase of $11.4 million from the second quarter 2025. The Bank’s communities and markets remain very competitive for deposits by customers who are very rate sensitive. Interest-bearing cost of deposits increased on a linked quarter basis to 1.91% in the third quarter of 2025 from 1.78% due to the shift of deposit balances from lower cost deposits to the Bank’s higher rate money market accounts and CDs. Total cost of funds, including noninterest sources decreased 0.04% on a linked quarter basis to 1.32%. During the quarter the bank paid off all advances from the FHLB, which were $30 million at the end of the third quarter 2024 and $13.0 million at the end of the second quarter of 2025. Mr. Hanna commented, ""We are glad to see continued growth in our deposit base as those deposits are a strength of our Bank and a big contributor to our strong liquidity. As of September 30, 2025, our liquidity sources improved to the point where we paid off all FHLB advances by the end of the quarter. We still have many sources for additional liquidity in the form of $50.9 million in borrowing capacity with the FHLB, open pledging capacity of our securities portfolio of $56.8 million, $34.6 million in borrowing capacity with FRB, and additional access to other wholesale funding of $123 million. This additional liquidity capacity will provide the funding we need to create a more customer-based balance sheet as our reliance on investment securities continues to decline while growing commercial loan relationships within our markets and the communities we serve.” The investment securities available for sale was $104.1 million, after the fair value adjustment of $22.3 million at September 30, 2025, with a yield of 2.23% for the third quarter 2025, down $15.8 million from the third quarter of 2024, and down $0.4 million from the second quarter of 2025. The effective duration of the securities portfolio is 7.3 years. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) of $16.2 million was up from $15.7 million when compared to the third quarter of 2024, and down from the second quarter of 2025 by $1.7 million. Changes in the Bank’s AOCL in the investment portfolio are attributable to changes in the economy as bonds with longer maturities are more sensitive to interest rate changes. The Bank does not intend to sell nor buy any new securities as our strategic direction is to grow our balance sheet through new loans instead of increasing our reliance on the securities portfolio. Each of the regulatory capital ratios for the Bank exceeds the well capitalized minimum levels currently required by regulatory statute. At September 30, 2025, the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios (Leverage, Tier I Risk Based and Total Risk Based) were 9.67%, 14.82 %, and 15.96% respectively. These compared to the ratios as of June 30, 2025, of 9.59%, 14.91%, and 16.06% and to September 30, 2024, of 10.11%, 15.47%, and 16.72%, respectively. Revenue Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin Net interest income was $2.8 million for both the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, compared to net interest income of $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2025. The net interest margin for the third quarter of 2025, on a tax equivalent basis, was 3.24% up 10 basis points from the third quarter of 2024 and up 11 basis points from the second quarter of 2025. The increase in the Bank’s net interest margin is due a continued change in the mix of earning assets from lower yielding assets to higher yielding loans. Yields on total loans improved by 15 basis points to 5.73% on a linked quarter basis and were up 4 basis points from the third quarter of 2024, while the total cost of funds was 1.32% in both the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, but down 4 basis points over the second quarter of 2025 from 1.36%. Total earning assets were $354.9 million, down $11.3 million from the third quarter 2024 and down $4.4 million from the second quarter 2025. Mr. Hanna commented, ""We continue to see our mix of earning assets move from cash and securities to a higher percentage of loans. A year ago, in the third quarter of 2024, our loans were 56% of our earning assets where today at the end of the third quarter of 2025, loans represented 61% of our total earning assets, up from 58% in the second quarter of 2025. This is an important and intentional shift in our balance sheet to work around the existing securities portfolio structure.” Non-Interest Income Non-interest income in the third quarter of 2025 was $571,000 compared to $354,000 in the third quarter of 2024 and $220,000 in the second quarter of 2025. Mortgage fees from VAWM for the third quarter of 2025 were $192,000, which was the primary cause of the increased non-interest income. The Bank anticipates continued increases in its non-interest income in the form of mortgage fees due to the acquisition of VAWM. Non-Interest Expense Noninterest expense totaled $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, up $0.3 million from the third quarter of 2024, and relatively equal to the second quarter of 2025. Most of the increase from the third quarter of 2024 was related to non-recurring legal and professional fees from the acquisition of VAWM as well as new operating expenses from VAWM. Salary and related employment benefits were up $211,000 from the third quarter 2024 primarily due to increased headcount at the bank in the latter part of 2024 and new salaries and benefit costs at VAWM. When compared to the second quarter 2025, these costs were down by $161,000 as reductions in headcount in the first and second quarters of 2025 are now being recognized. Salaries and related benefits at VAWM for the third quarter of 2025 were $139,000. Occupancy and equipment expenses, legal, accounting and professional fees, and data processing services combined were up by $89,000 from the third quarter 2024 and up $188,000 from the second quarter 2025 primarily due to increases in legal and professional fees related to the VAWM acquisition and interim finance and accounting consulting help. All other expenses were relatively flat when compared to the third quarter 2024 and second quarter 2025. Acquisition Summary - VA Wholesale Mortgage Incorporated As of the close of business on August 15, 2025, the Bank, a Maryland-chartered bank, completed the acquisition of VAWM, a Virginia corporation engaged in residential mortgage banking, lending, and brokerage services, from Eric Tan, its sole shareholder (""Seller”). Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Bank purchased 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of VAWM for a total purchase price of $750,000, payable under a 36-month, interest-free promissory note. The note provides for monthly forgiveness of one-thirty-sixth of the balance over the term, subject to continuing employment and other specified conditions. Amortization of the note will be treated as compensation expense. In addition, the Seller is entitled to post-closing contingent consideration (""earn-out”) equal to 33% of VAWM’s net earnings plus 0.04% of closed-loan volume for a period of three years following the closing date, estimated to be $298,000 based on historical production and future growth. Earn-out payments are to be determined annually based on VAWM’s financial results, with supporting statements delivered after each year-end. Concurrent with closing, the Seller entered into an employment agreement with the Bank, continuing to serve in a management role to support the integration of the mortgage operations into the Bank’s business. The acquisition was affected through a private stock purchase and did not involve the issuance of any shares by the Bank. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase of a business under ASC 805, with VAWM becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank.

Greece and Canada Explore Year-Round Direct Flight Service from Athens to Boost their Tourism and Business Ties,"Published on November 1, 2025 With the view to upgrading the Greek-Canadian bilateral relations, Greek Minister of Infrastructure and Transport Christos Dimas met with Canadian Transport Minister Steven MacKinnon to discuss a year-round, direct flight between Athens and Canada. The talks came during the Delphi Economic Forum Toronto Edition, where both countries discussed ways to deepen cooperation on aviation, logistics, digital infrastructure, and sustainable mobility. This new airlift will add even more force to tourism exchange between the two nations, which will also create new opportunities for business exchange and economic development.A Strategic Move to Enhance Tourism and ConnectivityThe proposal for a direct Athens–Canada flight comes at a time when both Greece and Canada are working to expand their tourism offerings and economic ties. As tourism demand continues to rise in both countries, establishing a direct air link would significantly reduce travel time and costs, benefiting both tourists and business professionals. With Canada’s large Greek diaspora and Greece’s rich cultural and natural offerings, the new service would not only attract more tourists but also strengthen cultural exchanges and mutual understanding between the two nations.Advertisement Minister Dimas emphasized that the proposed route would help position Greece as a gateway to Europe for Canadian travelers, facilitating access to not only Athens but also Greek islands like Santorini, Mykonos, and Crete. At the same time, it would provide Canadians with a convenient link to explore the rich cultural and natural attractions of Greece. By improving connectivity, Greece and Canada can work together to bolster the tourism sector, creating sustainable growth and offering unique travel experiences for visitors from both countries.Strengthening Economic and Trade RelationsWhile tourism is a key focus of this initiative, the direct Athens–Canada route will also have a substantial economic impact, particularly in trade relations. The proposed flight will help facilitate business exchanges and trade opportunities between Greece and Canada, particularly in industries such as shipping, agriculture, renewable energy, and technology.Advertisement By improving air connectivity, both countries will benefit from easier travel for business professionals, enabling smoother cross-border collaborations and improving the movement of goods and services. For example, Greek exporters will have enhanced access to the Canadian market, while Canadian businesses will find it easier to connect with partners in Greece and Southern Europe. This increased connectivity could also lead to new investment opportunities and a deeper integration of Greek and Canadian economies.A Focus on Sustainable Aviation and Eco-Friendly TravelBoth ministers highlighted the importance of sustainable mobility as part of this potential air service. The new flight will feature the latest in eco-friendly aviation technology, focusing on reducing carbon emissions and improving fuel efficiency. Greece’s tourism sector has increasingly prioritized sustainable travel in recent years, and the launch of the Athens–Canada route will align with these efforts by providing a green travel option for visitors.Advertisement The airline operating the route is expected to use fuel-efficient aircraft, such as the Airbus A320neo or A321neo, which are designed to significantly reduce CO2 emissions compared to older models. The focus on sustainability extends to the tourism experience as well, with eco-friendly accommodations and activities in Greece being promoted as part of the country’s push to become a leader in sustainable tourism. This aligns with Canada’s commitment to reducing its environmental footprint, particularly in the aviation and travel industries.Cultural and Educational Exchange OpportunitiesThe Athens–Canada direct route will not only foster tourism and business exchanges, but will also open doors for cultural and educational opportunities. Greek students and academics will benefit from easier access to Canadian universities and institutions, while Canadian travelers will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in Greek culture, history, and art. The two countries have long shared cultural ties, and a direct flight will only deepen these connections, allowing for greater collaboration in the arts, education, and heritage preservation.Cultural and heritage tourism in Greece is flourishing, and the new service would provide Canadians with better access to Greek heritage sites, including the Acropolis, Delphi, and Olympia, as well as the UNESCO World Heritage Sites found across the Greek islands.Supporting Sustainable Tourism Growth in GreeceGreece’s tourism sector continues to grow, with the country consistently attracting millions of visitors every year. However, the government is increasingly focusing on sustainable growth and destination management, ensuring that tourism development is environmentally responsible and socially beneficial for local communities. The Athens–Canada direct flight would play a vital role in supporting these goals, as it would promote regional tourism beyond the popular islands and larger cities, encouraging travelers to visit rural areas, archaeological sites, and small towns.Furthermore, the direct air connection could help reduce the pressure on overcrowded tourist destinations, by providing access to lesser-known regions and spreading tourism activity more evenly throughout the country. This sustainable tourism model aligns with the broader vision of creating long-term economic benefits for local communities, while also ensuring the preservation of Greece’s natural beauty and cultural heritage.Future Outlook: Expanding Greece-Canada Tourism and Trade RelationsIn the future, the Athens–Canada route is expected to act as a springboard to further growth in tourism and economic cooperation between Greece and Canada. The government and tourism authorities will continue to work closely with the airlines, travel agencies, and business partners to ensure that the route is successful and expands the connections to other key Canadian cities.The potential success of the Athens–Canada route will, in turn, encourage more regional air connectivity initiatives within the European and North American tourism markets. The ongoing cooperation between Greece and Canada sends the signal of commitment toward strengthening ties and building a future of sustainable and mutually beneficial tourism and economic exchanges.Advertisement Share On:Tags: Athens Canada direct flights for tourism, Greece Canada direct route for business and tourism growth, Greece Canada tourism and business ties, sustainable air travel Greece Canada 2025, year-round direct flight Athens CanadaSubscribe to our NewslettersFollow Travel And Tour World in Google News The proposal for a direct Athens–Canada flight comes at a time when both Greece and Canada are working to expand their tourism offerings and economic ties.

OpenAI Launches Paid Tier for Sora AI Video Generations,"In a move that signals the maturation of artificial intelligence tools from experimental novelties to revenue-generating platforms, OpenAI has introduced a paid tier for its Sora video generation app, allowing users to purchase additional credits beyond daily free limits. This development, announced recently, marks a pivotal shift for the company as it seeks to balance accessibility with financial sustainability in the competitive AI space. According to reports, users can now buy bundles of 10 extra video generations for $4, a nominal fee that extends the app’s utility for heavy users who exhaust their complimentary allocations. The Sora app, which debuted on iOS with capabilities to create stunning AI-generated videos from text prompts, initially offered unlimited free generations to foster adoption and feedback. However, as user numbers swell, OpenAI is recalibrating its model to manage computational costs and prevent abuse. Bill Peebles, Sora’s chief, explained in interviews that this pay-for-more approach is the first step in a broader monetization strategy, with plans to reduce free daily limits in the coming months. Monetization Strategies Taking Shape Industry observers note that this pricing structure aligns with OpenAI’s evolving business model, reminiscent of how it transitioned ChatGPT from free access to subscription-based Plus and Enterprise tiers. The Verge detailed how the company is positioning Sora not just as a creative tool but as a potential economic ecosystem, including future licensing for copyrighted characters and cameo features. This could open revenue streams from partnerships with content creators and media firms, potentially transforming Sora into a marketplace for AI-enhanced video production. Moreover, the introduction of paid credits addresses the high operational expenses associated with AI video generation, which demands significant GPU resources. Sources indicate that while the current free tier allows around 30 generations per day, reductions are imminent to encourage upgrades, a tactic echoed in gaming and software industries where freemium models drive premium conversions. Implications for Users and Creators For creative professionals, this change could democratize access to advanced tools while introducing barriers for casual users. Filmmakers and marketers, who rely on iterative generation for projects, may welcome the option to scale up without waiting for resets, but concerns about equity arise. Mashable highlighted user reactions, with some praising the affordability of the $4 bundle, while others worry it foreshadows steeper paywalls that could stifle innovation in underserved communities. OpenAI’s executives have emphasized that this is part of building a “new Sora economy,” including monetized features like reusable avatars and video stitching. As Business Insider reported, the company envisions users earning from their creations, perhaps through integrated marketplaces, blending AI generation with blockchain-like royalty systems. The Broader AI Industry Shift This pivot reflects broader trends in the AI sector, where companies like Google and Meta are also exploring hybrid free-paid models to recoup investments in training massive models. Analysts suggest OpenAI’s strategy could set precedents for how generative AI tools evolve from hype to profitable ventures, especially amid regulatory scrutiny over energy consumption and intellectual property. Critics, however, point to potential downsides, such as increased digital divides. Mint noted that while the iOS-exclusive rollout limits accessibility, expansions to other platforms are planned, potentially broadening reach. As OpenAI navigates these waters, the success of Sora’s paid features will likely influence investor confidence and competitive responses. Future Horizons and Challenges Looking ahead, OpenAI plans to integrate more advanced capabilities, such as higher-resolution outputs and collaborative editing, which could justify premium pricing. Yet, challenges remain, including competition from open-source alternatives and ethical concerns over deepfakes. Engadget reported on the company’s intent to introduce licensing options, allowing brands to protect and profit from their IP within Sora’s ecosystem. Ultimately, this monetization layer underscores OpenAI’s ambition to lead in AI video, turning creative potential into a sustainable business. As the platform matures, it may redefine content creation, blending human ingenuity with machine efficiency in ways that benefit both innovators and the bottom line.",2025-10-31 20:16:16,Webpronews,positive,0.8538,-1,Outlier," OpenAI has introduced a paid tier for its Sora video generation app, allowing users to purchase additional credits beyond daily free limits .

He expressed appreciation to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his leadership and ongoing reforms in the economy and security sectors, assuring that Sokoto would continue to align with the President’s development agenda. “With this commissioning, we are not just opening a road; we are opening a pathway to a brighter future,” he said. In his remarks, Abdulaziz Abubakar Yari, former Zamfara State Governor, praised Governor Ahmed Aliyu for embarking on people-oriented projects, noting that the people of Sokoto State are proud of his leadership. The governor then inaugurated the Mabera Road Network for public use, marking a significant milestone in the state’s infrastructural development.

"Impound, Don’t Go Nuclear","Eliminating the Senate filibuster would be a boon for the Democrats. President Trump, after completing his highly successful trade and diplomacy trip to the Indo-Pacific region, where he outfoxed and cornered Communist China in so many areas, then wrote a long Truth Social note where he advocated for ending the government shutdown with what is called the “nuclear option.” He wrote: “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW.” I can surely understand Mr. Trump’s frustration with the radical Democratic Party that is being driven by the Mamdani-AOC-Bernie Sanders socialist wing. Yet I do not think ending the filibuster is a good idea. Speaking as someone who strongly supports the president’s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation, energy dominance, reciprocal free trade, closing the border and so forth, I think ending the filibuster would do great damage to those pro-growth policies, which miraculously passed under “one big, beautiful” bill. Mr. Trump himself admits in his Truth Social post that the Democrats fought hard to end the filibuster, but failed. He even notes that ending the filibuster would at some point allow Democrats to pack the Supreme Court, make Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico new states, thereby picking up four senate seats and many House seats and electoral votes from those ultra-liberal places. The Committee to Unleash Prosperity adds to the list it would’ve passed without the filibuster: A national voter ID ban, the Green New Deal, card check for union elections, a $15 minimum wage, a cap-and-trade national energy tax, completely socialized medicine, and the PRO Act’s forced unionization. Let’s not go there. I have a much better idea: presidential impoundment. Mr. Trump’s budget director, Russell Vought, is ready to pull the trigger on non-essential federal employees who will remain non-essential, forever. I call it DOGE 2.0. In short, keep the non-essential non-essential; that’s existential. And all those pork-barrel Democratic spending items that President Biden lined up for his re-election last year, that stuff was so bad it even gives waste, fraud, and abuse a bad name. I’ll be polite: they’re all non-essential. Because the government is presently unfunded, the chief executive has the authority to impound personnel and non-entitlement programs. While Mr. Vought has his weapon locked and loaded, he’s being held back by a lower court judge who has enjoined the administration from taking these actions. Yet all that is on appeal and is likely to be overturned. Unquestionably, Mr. Trump as the chief of the executive branch has the inherent constitutional power to impound during this period. If Democrats come back to power without a filibuster rule to restrain them, they will spend, tax, and regulate a quadrillion dollars worth of programs that will destroy the economy. On the other hand, if Mr. Trump exercises his executive authority to impound non-essentials, he will greatly slim down the size and scope of the federal government, while reducing deficits and debt along the way. In that scenario, economic prosperity will flourish almost more than anybody can possibly imagine.

"PA premier says Ramallah best placed to lead postwar Gaza, despite Israeli obstacles","Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa made the case on Thursday for Ramallah to play a leading role in the postwar management of Gaza, arguing that it is best positioned to do so despite the obstacles put up by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. “The Palestinian Authority is important, not only for keep[ing] the West Bank stable, but also for restoring the situation in Gaza,” Mustafa said during a virtual event with the Washington-based Brookings Institution think tank. “Despite all the challenges, despite all the difficulties, despite the issues that need reform — which we are working on — the only party that can get things back on track with support from international partners is the Palestinian Authority.” While much of the international community backs the PA replacing Hamas as the governing body in Gaza, Israel has maintained an effective veto over the transition, claiming that the Ramallah-based body is irredeemably corrupt and encourages violence against Israel. US President Donald Trump’s administration has sometimes been similarly critical of the PA, and even barred PA President Mahmoud Abbas from entering the US for the UN General Assembly last month. But as key Arab stakeholders have conditioned their support in the post-war management of Gaza on a role for a reformed PA, Washington appears to be slightly adapting its approach, allowing Abbas to participate in a conference of world leaders earlier this month in Egypt, where Trump was seen warmly embracing the PA leader. A longtime economic adviser to Abbas who previously served as deputy prime minister and economy minister, in addition to heading the Palestine Investment Fund and holding senior positions at the World Bank, Mustafa was appointed prime minister last year amid mounting calls for reform of the PA, which hasn’t held parliamentary elections since 2006 and presidential elections since 2005. He used the relatively rare appearance before an American audience to lay out the challenges the PA faces and the reforms that he has been implementing. Mustafa began by highlighting the over 1,000 checkpoints that the IDF has sprung up throughout the West Bank that have significantly curbed Palestinian movement, hampering the West Bank economy as a result. Israel says the measures are needed to maintain the security of settlers living in the territory amid efforts by Palestinian terror groups to target civilians and soldiers. The PA premier went on to highlight the over $3 billion in funds that the Israeli government has been withholding from the PA, which “has been making our economic life extremely difficult.” Due to the PA’s sub-state status, the Oslo Accords stipulate that Israel collect clearance revenues on the authority’s behalf and transfer those funds on a monthly basis to Ramallah. The PA is heavily reliant on the funds, which make up a majority of its annual budget. Israel has repeatedly withheld such funds, citing the PA’s welfare payments to convicted terrorists and their families, as well as the relatives of dead attackers, with Jerusalem saying the practice directly rewards terror. Abbas signed a decree in February ending the policy of payments to prisoners based on the length of their sentence. While documents obtained by The Times of Israel indicate that the old system has indeed been scrapped, Israel claims it remains in place, but has yet to offer proof on the matter. The lack of funds has meant public sector employees have missed out on 13 months of salary payments over the last three years alone, Mustafa said. Public school teachers have gone on strike due to partially paid salaries, thus causing a delay to the start of the school year. Meanwhile, new Israeli banking policies have also prevented the PA from depositing roughly $4.6 billion, creating a severe liquidity crisis that has compounded the already-dire economic situation. Unemployment in the West Bank has climbed to 35 percent, with more than 200,000 Palestinians losing their jobs inside Israel when the IDF revoked their entry permits due to security concerns following the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023. Mustafa said that Ramallah has managed to convince Arab and European countries to provide additional assistance to offset the lack of funds, but the PA is still piling up a massive deficit due to borrowing from the private sector. The PA premier then highlighted the IDF’s counter-terror operations throughout the West Bank that have forced tens of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in the midst of the economic crisis. Israel says such operations are a security necessity to combat entrenched terror networks and prevent numerous plots for deadly attacks every year. Those raids have taken place amid near-daily attacks by settlers on Palestinians that have gone largely unchecked. The Biden administration led Western countries in sanctioning extremist settler individuals and entities last year. But Trump had undone the policy, and Mustafa acknowledged that the sanctions had little effect on the ground. Nonetheless, he urged countries to take “more serious actions to give the right signal… to this Israeli government that this is not acceptable.” Asked about the reforms that he and the PA are undertaking, Mustafa acknowledged that Ramallah still has work to do, but he pointed to elections that Abbas has agreed to hold next year. Municipal elections will also be held in early 2026, the prime minister said. Abbas has announced plans for elections on multiple occasions in the past, but has repeatedly canceled them. He has blamed Israeli restrictions, but critics have pointed to fears that he and his widely unpopular Fatah party would suffer crushing defeats in any public vote. “Even if we are not the best performing administration in the world, we still have a responsibility toward our people, especially our people in Gaza,” Mustafa said. “What they need most today is assistance so that we can shelter them, send their kids back to schools, treat the injured people, start getting them new jobs… [and] rebuild Gaza.” He also noted that while many world leaders have called on the PA to reform, the term has become something of a buzzword that often goes unspecified. “While we are making every effort to [carry out] these reforms, we hope that this will not be used as an excuse for the Israeli government to continue its occupation,” Mustafa said. As for the PA’s ability to resume running Gaza after it was ousted by Hamas in 2007, Mustafa pointed out that Ramallah already has 35,000 employees in the Strip, including 6,000 teachers, 7,000 doctors and thousands of dormant security personnel, which could serve as the backbone for a police force necessary for stabilizing Gaza. Several thousand other PA employees are also being trained by Jordan and Egypt in order to be later deployed in Gaza, he said, adding that PA personnel have also been tasked with helping resume the management of the Rafah Border Crossing, once Israel agrees to reopen it. Mustafa said the PA is prepared to formally invite an international security force to help stabilize the Strip, as envisioned by Trump’s 20-point plan for ending the war. However, he stressed that the security force be mandated by the UN Security Council, work with and support existing PA forces, and also be a temporary solution. “I encourage everybody to help get the PA in the right place… not only to govern in the West Bank, but also in Gaza because this is the best way possible to get us out of the situation in [the Strip],” Mustafa continued. “No international mission alone can do it. The PA is a big asset for stability in the region.” Asked in closing how he views the recent decisions by several major Western countries to recognize a Palestinian state, Mustafa insisted that those moves were not merely symbolic. “I think this will help us restore hope that a two-state solution is still possible [by demonstrating that] there is still a strong international support for it,” he said. “It’s important to remind the Israeli government and the Israeli people that occupation is not the solution. There are still millions of Palestinians living next door, and they still demand their rights, regardless of time passing.” Support The Times of Israel's independent journalism and receive access to our documentary series, DocuNation: The Heart of Israel.

Ahiagbah Demands Urgent Action on Stalled Feed Ghana Agenda,"Political figure Richard Ahiagbah has demanded immediate government action to revive Ghana’s stalled agricultural agenda. He contends that critical delays in the Feed Ghana program are depriving farmers and the national economy of promised benefits. Ahiagbah argued the initiative, designed to enhance food security and provide farmer support, has failed to show meaningful progress. He expressed particular concern over the absence of promised buffer stock systems and market access for local producers. These shortcomings especially impact local rice farmers grappling with post harvest losses, he noted. The situation reportedly undermines confidence in the administration’s flagship strategy and hinders the sector’s potential for job creation and expanded production. Ahiagbah challenged the government to reaffirm its commitment to import substitution. He specifically urged authorities to bolster domestic capacity for rice production. “It would be a feather in the president’s cap to promote our local capacity,” Ahiagbah stated, advocating for political will to support Ghanaian growers over import cartels. He further emphasized that locally produced rice offers superior nutritional value compared to imported alternatives. Consistent execution of agricultural reforms, he maintained, would conserve foreign exchange, stabilize the cedi, generate employment, and ensure sustainable sector growth.",2025-10-31 21:13:49,News Ghana,negative,0.6793,42,Market_Between_Business, Richard Ahiagbah has demanded immediate government action to revive Ghana’s stalled agricultural agenda .

Wall Street gains on Amazon boost but rate caution tempers enthusiasm,"Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox Traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, in New York City, on Oct 30. PHOTO: AFP Summary AI generated Published Nov 01, 2025, 05:13 AM Updated Nov 01, 2025, 05:13 AM NEW YORK - Wall Street’s main stock indexes closed higher on Oct 31, with their biggest boost coming from Amazon’s upbeat earnings forecast, but sentiment was dampened by worries that the Federal Reserve is becoming more cautious about cutting rates. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow boasted weekly gains and their longest monthly winning streaks in years. Amazon shares rallied sharply, closing up 9.6 per cent after hitting an all-time high following its forecast for quarterly sales above estimates. The online retailer and cloud services giant helped the consumer discretionary sector close up 4 per cent for its biggest one-day gain since May 12. But elsewhere in megacap companies, Apple’s shares closed down 0.4 per cent after its forecast for iPhone holiday quarter sales surpassed Wall Street expectations was clouded by chief executive officer Tim Cook’s flagging of supply constraints. And in remarks that cooled investor hopes for policy easing, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president Raphael Bostic said on Oct 31 that a December rate cut was not locked in despite market expectations for a cut. And Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Beth Hammack said she had opposed a rate cut on Oct 29 because inflation is too high. On Oct 31, traders were pricing in a 65 per cent probability of a December rate cut, down from 72.8 per cent on Oct 30 and 91.7 per cent a week ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. “The theme today is pretty similar to what we saw yesterday. It’s earnings coming in a little better than expected but tempered by a little more hawkish commentary from the Fed,” said Mr James Ragan, co-CIO and director of investment management research at D.A. Davidson. Mr Jake Seltz, portfolio manager for the Empiric LT Equity team at Allspring, said investors “may have gotten in front of their skis” in their bets for lower rates. Some grocery stocks traded lower on Oct 31 on worries about a dip in November sales if federal food aid benefits, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or Snap, lapse in the ongoing government shutdown. Two federal judges ruled on Oct 31 that President Donald Trump’s administration cannot suspend food aid for millions of Americans during the shutdown, saying the government must use contingency funds to pay for the benefits. But shares of grocer Kroger ended down 2.8 per cent while food supplier Conagra Brands lost 1.3 per cent and Walmart ended down 1 per cent even after the rulings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 40.75 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 47,562.87, the S&P 500 gained 17.86 points, or 0.26 per cent, to 6,840.20 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 143.81 points, or 0.61 per cent, to 23,724.96. For the month, the S&P 500 added 2.27 per cent, for a sixth consecutive monthly gain, which was its longest such streak since August 2021. The Nasdaq Composite added 4.7 per cent for October, capping a seven-month winning streak, its longest since early 2018. The Dow rose 2.5 per cent for the month, for its sixth straight monthly gain and its longest monthly advance since January 2018. For the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent while the Nasdaq added 2.24 per cent and the Dow climbed 0.75 per cent. Of the 315 S&P 500 companies that have reported third-quarter results so far, 83.2 per cent have surpassed analysts’ estimates, according to LSEG data. That is well above the historical average, where roughly 67 per cent of firms beat forecasts. With a lack of economic data from the government due to the month-long shutdown, Ms Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital, said investors were keenly focused on earnings reports. “The government isn’t giving us the data that we have become dependent on, so we’re using companies as we should by the way for guidance about how the economy is going,” she said. In other moves, Warner Bros Discovery jumped 8.7 per cent following a Reuters report that Netflix was actively exploring a bid for the company’s studio and streaming business. Netflix rose 2.7 per cent after it unveiled plans for a 10-for-1 stock split. Western Digital closed up 8.7 per cent after rallying to an all-time high following its forecast of quarterly earnings above Wall Street estimates.

Oakland County debuts 2025 ‘Local Gems’ contest,"Some shoppers in Oakland County can win between $250 and $1,000 in November as part of the annual Local Gems Sweepstakes. The rules are pretty simple: Visit one or more of the county’s 6,000-plus small retail businesses, take a selfie at the store and submit the entry to the county. A random drawing of selfies submitted online, in person or by mail determines the winner of the three prizes: $1,000, $500, or $250. Every entry must include a photo of the person inside or outside a local small business. The contest gets underway on Saturday, Nov. 1 and continues through Nov. 30. This year’s contest was launched in downtown Pontiac at Designed Mindfully, an interior-design company. Designed Mindfully was among the 2024’s top vote getters, with HobbyTown and AM2PM Barbershop in Southfield; It’s the Little Things in Ortonville; and Vibrant Vizionz in Oak Park. Designed Mindfully owner Deya Marchand said her shop is more than a small store. “We are a space where community, creativity, and intentional living come together,” she said, adding that Local Gems aligns beautifully with her store’s mission “to live and shop with purpose, supporting other small businesses and local artists.” The number of small businesses joining the effort grows each year. In 2024, the contest highlighted nearly 500 unique businesses scattered among 47 of the county’s 62 communities. County Executive Dave Coulter said small businesses are the backbone of the county’s economy and Local Gems is “a fun way to highlight and support them, especially as we head into the holiday shopping season.” Local Gems is a joint effort by Oakland County Economic Development with partners Oakland Thrive, Main Street Oakland County and Genisys Credit Union, Genisys Credit Union is providing the prize money. Jackie Buchanan, the credit union’s president and CEO, said shopping locally is “an investment that strengthens our small businesses and builds a unified community.” She likened the contest to treasure hunting as a way to enjoy the holiday season. Local Gems is organized each year by Advantage Oakland, the county’s economic development, with Genisys, Main Street Oakland County and Oakland Thrive, the small business assistance agency. Dom Holmes, the county’s economic development director, said Local Gems is a good way for residents to discover new favorites among long-time neighborhood staples. Thrive CEO Camille Walker-Banks said contests like Local Gems is a good way to remind residents that “every purchase made locally strengthens our communities and creates lasting impact.” Small business owners can join the effort by displaying Local Gems Sweepstakes posters, available through Advantage Oakland while supplies last.

West Africa Takes Digital Leap With SIGMAT Customs Launch,"The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is officially launching a homegrown digital customs platform that could fundamentally transform how goods move across the region’s borders, as technical experts from Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Liberia convene in Monrovia this week to finalize preparations for rolling out the Interconnected System for the Management of Goods in Transit. The two day meeting, taking place October 30 through 31 in the Liberian capital, brings together senior customs officials and ICT specialists to review operational guidelines and technical protocols before Friday’s official launch ceremony. SIGMAT, as the platform is known, represents years of planning to create a real time digital network enabling customs authorities across ECOWAS member states to exchange transit data electronically, track cargo movements, and process clearances with minimal paperwork. The system is designed to make cross border trade faster, safer, and more transparent, with officials saying the platform will help tackle smuggling and documentation fraud while ensuring more efficient coordination among customs agencies along regional trade corridors. For a region where trucks can sit at borders for days awaiting clearance while goods spoil and costs mount, the potential impact looks substantial. What makes SIGMAT particularly significant is its homegrown nature. Rather than importing expensive foreign solutions that might not fit West African realities, ECOWAS developed this platform specifically for the region’s needs and challenges. As of May 2025, nine ECOWAS member states had already installed SIGMAT in their customs IT systems, with only Guinea Bissau and Cabo Verde yet to implement, demonstrating momentum building toward broader regional adoption. The initial rollout among Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Liberia creates a strategic corridor linking coastal and landlocked nations, addressing one of West Africa’s most persistent trade challenges. Landlocked countries like Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger depend entirely on coastal neighbors for access to international markets, making efficient transit systems crucial for their economic survival. When transit goods get stuck at borders or disappear through diversion, these landlocked nations suffer disproportionately. Friday’s launch ceremony will be attended by the Heads of Customs Administrations from the three participating countries, representatives of the ECOWAS Commission, and key development partners including the German International Cooperation Agency, which has supported SIGMAT’s development. This multi stakeholder approach reflects recognition that transforming regional trade requires coordination across governments, technical agencies, and international supporters. The platform operates as a centralized digital hub connecting customs administrations across member states. Importers, exporters, and customs agents submit declarations electronically through the SIGMAT portal, which then standardizes documentation across ECOWAS countries, reducing discrepancies and ensuring compliance with regional trade agreements. The system allows customs officials in different countries to access shared data instantly, eliminating redundant paperwork that has historically slowed border crossings. For goods in transit, SIGMAT provides end to end visibility by issuing electronic transit documents tracked in real time as cargo moves across borders. This ensures duties and taxes are properly managed while reducing risks of smuggling and revenue leakage that have plagued West African trade corridors for decades. A shipment moving from Abidjan to Monrovia, for instance, would be monitored digitally with automated alerts for any deviations from approved routes. The system’s benefits extend beyond just faster processing. By reducing clearance times by up to 40% and minimizing physical inspections, SIGMAT can lower costs for businesses through reduced demurrage and storage charges that have long plagued ports due to delays. For traders operating on thin margins, these savings could mean the difference between profit and loss on shipments. Revenue protection represents another crucial advantage. West African governments lose millions annually to customs fraud, cargo diversion, and underdeclaration of goods values. When paper based systems dominate and different countries can’t communicate electronically, tracking goods becomes nearly impossible once they leave the first border. SIGMAT’s real time monitoring makes it far harder for unscrupulous traders to game the system. The platform builds on earlier pilot programs that demonstrated viability. Nigeria and Benin Republic launched SIGMAT connectivity in May 2025 at the Seme Krake border, a critical junction on the Abidjan Lagos corridor that handles massive trade volumes. That pilot showed the technical feasibility of connecting different national customs systems and highlighted both successes and challenges that informed subsequent rollouts. Nigeria’s Comptroller General of Customs noted at that May launch that the concept was conceived over a decade ago, designed to improve goods visibility in transit, combat diversion and fraud along trade corridors, foster inter agency coordination, and reduce trade delays. The long development timeline reflects both the technical complexity and the political will required to align different national interests around common regional standards. Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, and Niger successfully implemented SIGMAT interconnections earlier, providing proof of concept that the system works when properly deployed. Those landlocked Sahelian nations have particular incentive to make transit systems efficient given their complete dependence on coastal access. Their experiences offer valuable lessons for this week’s Monrovia launch. However, SIGMAT faces real implementation challenges. Many West African countries struggle with unreliable electricity, poor digital infrastructure, and inconsistent internet access. A digital customs platform only works as well as the underlying connectivity supporting it. If power fails or internet drops at critical border points, the entire system risks grinding to halt, potentially creating worse bottlenecks than the paper systems it replaces. Political will represents another variable. Customs policies vary significantly across ECOWAS member states, reflecting different national interests, economic priorities, and revenue needs. Some countries depend heavily on customs revenue and may resist transparency that could reduce collections in the short term, even if regional integration benefits everyone long term. Getting fifteen countries to implement common standards and maintain consistent enforcement requires sustained political commitment. There’s also the human factor. The most sophisticated digital system proves useless if border agents, customs officers, and traders don’t understand, trust, or use it properly. Training programs must reach thousands of personnel across multiple countries, explaining not just how SIGMAT works technically but why it serves everyone’s interests. Resistance from officials comfortable with existing systems, or who benefit from current inefficiencies, could quietly undermine implementation. For Liberia specifically, hosting this launch carries symbolic importance. The country has worked hard rebuilding its institutions and economy following years of civil conflict, and serving as the venue for significant regional initiatives demonstrates its reintegration into West African leadership. Successfully implementing SIGMAT could help Liberia strengthen its position as a reliable trade partner and transit hub. The timing also matters for regional integration efforts more broadly. ECOWAS continues pursuing its vision for an integrated West African economy with free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. Plans for a common currency, the ECO, target 2027 launch despite delays and challenges. SIGMAT represents tangible progress on integration that affects real traders and real goods today, building confidence that broader regional projects can succeed. Trade facilitation through digital systems aligns with global trends as well. Countries worldwide are digitizing customs operations through platforms like UNCTAD’s ASYCUDA system, which twelve ECOWAS members already use as their national customs software. SIGMAT’s ability to integrate with ASYCUDA creates technical foundations for sustainable expansion as more countries join. The broader economic implications could prove substantial. Faster, cheaper, more reliable cross border trade enables businesses to plan better, invest more confidently, and access larger markets. Small and medium enterprises particularly benefit when trade barriers fall, since they lack the resources that larger firms use to navigate complex customs procedures. If SIGMAT delivers promised improvements, it could unleash entrepreneurial energy across the region. For development partners supporting SIGMAT, the platform represents exactly the kind of regional public good worth investing in. Unlike projects benefiting single countries, SIGMAT creates network effects where value increases as more members join. German cooperation through GIZ reflects European interest in stable, prosperous West Africa as migration pressures and security concerns make regional development a strategic priority. Friday’s launch won’t solve all West African trade challenges instantly. Corruption, poor infrastructure, inconsistent regulations, and weak institutions will continue constraining commerce regardless of how well SIGMAT functions technically. But the platform addresses genuine problems in ways that create measurable improvements for stakeholders across the trade ecosystem. As customs chiefs and technical experts finalize preparations this week, they’re working on something that transcends routine government technology projects. SIGMAT embodies a vision where West African borders become connectors rather than barriers, where goods flow efficiently supporting economic growth, and where regional integration moves from aspiration toward reality one digital connection at a time. Whether SIGMAT fulfills its promise depends on sustained commitment across multiple countries over years of implementation. The Monrovia launch represents an important milestone, but true success will be measured by how many trucks cross borders faster, how much revenue governments collect more efficiently, and how many businesses thrive thanks to reduced trade friction across this dynamic but fragmented region.",2025-10-31 21:25:55,News Ghana,positive,0.6154,-1,Outlier," The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is officially launching a homegrown digital customs platform .

We were never meant to be anonymous,"I was born in Bangkok, Thailand — a metropolis of over 11 million people — and studied in Boston and Chicago. Today, I call Harmony, Minnesota home — a town along the Root River with a population boasting just over 1,000 people. Despite my affection for small town living, I still think of my urban upbringing fondly, and still salivate thinking of my favorite ramen restaurant in Chicago. Yet, in the midst of so many options of where to eat, who to befriend, where to spend my time, I also know that most of my city experiences included sitting in a crowded train, head down, with my face buried in my phone and clueless to the people around me. I was often more of a consumer of community, rather than a creator. I could go through a whole day and be completely anonymous. And while periods of anonymity can help you explore new parts of yourself, ultimately I don’t believe humans are meant to live anonymous lives. In an age of digital connection and hyper mobility, it’s easy to forget the quiet power of being known. Not just recognized, but truly known — by name, by story, by contribution. The poet Wendell Berry once wrote, “A community is the mental and spiritual condition of knowing that the place is shared, and that the people who share the place define and limit the possibilities of each other's lives.” That’s not just poetic — it’s a blueprint for vitality. Here in southern Minnesota, we see this truth play out every day. Our small towns are not just dots on a map; they are ecosystems of relationship. The barista who remembers your order, the neighbor who plows your driveway without asking, the school board member who provides in-home child care to your new infant — these are not coincidences. They are the fabric of a life that resists anonymity. At Southern Minnesota Initiative Foundation, we invest in this fabric. We believe that economic development is inseparable from human development. That thriving communities are built not just on infrastructure, but on trust. And that the vitality of a place depends on the visibility of its people. Just this month, we approved 23 Small Town Grants totaling $200,000 to support projects focused on creating a sense of belonging for all and are in the process of approving Taylor Rural Improvements Grant applications that can make a big impact on the vibrancy of small towns. When I tell you about why I love Harmony, it’s not just that we have four restaurants, a distillery and a grocery store all along our downtown drag — but that I can tell you about the chef who comes out of the kitchen to sing Pink Pony Club with his five-year-old daughter at open mic night, or the couple who moved from New Mexico to open a maker space for the community because they fell in love with a run-down building that they believed they could bring back to life. Our community knows their stories, and they show up to wrap their support around them. To us, it’s not just the end product but the process and people it takes to get there. Similarly, when SMIF supports early childhood programs, we’re not just preparing kids for school — we’re anchoring families in a shared future. When we fund local entrepreneurs, we’re not just boosting the economy — we’re affirming that dreams belong here. And when we partner with towns to support community initiatives, we’re not just contributing resources — we’re contributing to a sense of belonging. Berry’s words remind us that community is not a luxury — it’s a necessity. Humans were never meant to live anonymous lives. We are meant to be accountable, celebrated, challenged and cherished. That’s what small towns offer, both to long-time residents and the newcomers from across the state, country or from across the world, who help our small towns remain vital. And that’s why we must continue to invest in them — not just with dollars, but with belief. Before my predecessor retired, he launched the Tim Penny Small Towns endowment fund to establish a long-term investment vehicle dedicated to that very belief. Today, I get the honor of continuing to grow our Small Town Fund and invite those of you reading to join me. Because in the end, vitality isn’t measured by population size. It’s measured by the strength of connection. And in southern Minnesota, connection is our greatest resource. As always, I welcome your comments and questions.

'Why did he promise it?': Poilievre criticizes Carney for not securing U.S. trade deal,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is questioning why Prime Minister Mark Carney promised he could handle U.S. President Donald Trump, given that the two countries have yet to finalize a trade agreement that would see Canada granted some tariff relief. Speaking to CBC’s Rosemary Barton Live, Poilievre said Carney has not delivered on what he promised during the spring election campaign. “Mr. Carney promised a good deal by July 21. He promised he could negotiate a win with President Trump. Those were his promises,” he told host Rosemary Barton. “Some might say, ‘Look, it’s unrealistic to expect to get that from President Trump.’ So why did he promise it? It wasn't just that it was a promise. It was the promise.” Carney’s key message during the spring election campaign was centred around dealing with the U.S. administration. Negotiators were working toward a potential deal on tariffs until Trump abruptly called off trade talks in a late-night social media post last week. The president said his decision was due to an advertisement by the Ontario government that uses former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's own words to send an anti-tariff message to American audiences. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said Carney apologized for the ad, which was pulled off the air on Monday — but not before it was played over the weekend, including on American networks during the World Series. “I have a very good relationship [with Carney]. I like him a lot, but what they did was wrong. He was very nice. He apologized for what they did with the commercial,” Trump said on Friday in a scrum with reporters on Air Force One. The Prime Minister's Office has not confirmed whether Carney personally apologized for the ad. Trump also said he has no plans to resume trade talks with Canada. When asked how he would handle the relationship with Trump, Poilievre argued boosting the economy would put Canada in a position of strength and rang off some of his promises to get major projects built. But he suggested that speculating if his approach would work better than Carney’s isn’t helpful at the moment because he isn’t prime minister. “What we do know is that Mr. Carney is prime minister — has been for seven months — and these are the results that he's got,” he said. “His failures abroad are costing us at home.” The full interview with Poilievre will air on Rosemary Barton Live, Sunday at 10 a.m. ET.",2025-10-31 21:23:38,Yahoo!

Cuomo courts Sliwa voters in Russian NYC neighborhood — warning against danger of socialist Zohran Mamdani,"Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo made an appeal to Republican voters in Brooklyn’s Russian-speaking enclave Friday — warning them a vote for GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa will only help socialist Zohran Mamdani get elected. The independent mayoral candidate positioned himself as the only viable option to beat the front-runner Democratic nominee, campaigning alongside firebrand Republican Councilwoman Inna Vernikov in Brighton Beach. “There is no way Curtis Sliwa can actually win. Curtis Sliwa can only make Zohran Mamdani win,” Cuomo said, recalling President Trump’s brutal prognosis of the Guardian Angels founder’s chances in the Nov. 4 election. “Don’t believe me. Believe President Trump if you’re a Republican” Cuomo told voters at the Ocean View Cafe, a Ukrainian restaurant on Brighton Beach Avenue. “President Trump said Curtis Sliwa is not ready for prime time.” Vernikov, a staunch Republican who nonetheless endorsed Cuomo over her party’s nominee this week, recalled the local community is largely made up of “families who escaped the former Soviet Union.” “They escaped communism and socialism. A lot of people here are Jewish immigrants. They escaped antisemitism,” she said. “We came to America for the American dream, for capitalism, for the free market economy, for opportunities for our children. “And what we’re seeing now is everything that we escaped, communism, socialism, antisemitism is coming back into New York City.” The local councilwoman, for the 48th District, previously supported Sliwa for mayor — but changed her tune to back Cuomo after seeing polling results showing the veteran Democrat had a better chance of beating socialist Mamdani. “Curtis Sliwa cannot be mayor because he is not winning … the only one who can beat Mamdani is Governor Andrew Cuomo,” she said, referring to recent polls that show Cuomo between 10 to 25 points behind Mamdani and Sliwa lagging by 25 to 29 points. The councilwoman — who was arrested in 2023 for wielding a firearm at a pro-Palestinian rally — referred to Mamdani as a “communist and an antisemitic” to her constituents. Mamdani, who identifies as a democratic socialist, last week held a press conference slamming the rhetoric spewed by his opponents as Islamophobic — which Cuomo and Sliwa have denied. Daniel Kurzyna, a spokesperson for Sliwa, said the concerted effort from Vernikov and Cuomo to siphon the GOP standard-bearer’s voters was “not needle-moving whatsoever.” “Curtis will shock the world,” he said.

Investing in affordable rental homes in North Vancouver,"NORTH VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 31, 2025 /CNW/ - Solving Canada's housing crisis requires immediate action to build up supply and bring down costs. The Government of Canada is stepping up with unprecedented investments to supercharge housing construction in Canada. To that end, the federal government launched Build Canada Homes, a new federal agency that will build affordable housing at scale, including transitional and supportive housing, deeply affordable and community housing, and affordable homes for the Canadian middle class. As we build a strong Canadian housing sector, purposeful collaboration will be essential. That means working together with the private and non-profit sectors to bring down costs and build homes at a scale and pace not seen in generations. These investments are also providing Canadians with increased access to affordable and sustainable housing. The Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) provides funding through low-interest and/or forgivable loans or contributions to partnered organizations for new affordable housing and the renovation and repair of existing, affordable and community housing. Today, the Honourable Gregor Robertson, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure and Minister responsible for Pacific Economic Development Canada was joined by the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Member of Parliament for North Vancouver – Capilano, and Linda Buchanan, Mayor of the City of North Vancouver toured the first phase of an ambitious affordable housing project at 144 St Georges Avenue, which is nearing completion and which received support from the federal government. The second phase of this project is receiving $84.5 million in funding to help build 179 secure, affordable rental homes at 120 St Georges Avenue. They also This is an example of the Government of Canada's commitment to investing in affordable housing right across the country The 18-storey, mass timber building will provide housing for singles, couples, families, and seniors in North Vancouver. The rental homes will range in size from studio to three-bedroom units. This is the second phase of the North Shore Neighbourhood House Hub Redevelopment, which is a multi-partner project on City-owned land that supports the City's ongoing commitment to increasing rental housing and community-based services. When all three phases are completed, it will provide rental housing, a new North Shore Neighbourhood House (NSNH), a respite centre with 18 overnight beds and 25 adult daycare spaces, and a redesigned Derek Inman Park. Budget 2025, to be tabled next week, will build on this momentum with further measures to lower costs for builders, catalyse private capital, and work towards doubling the pace of homebuilding across Canada. Budget 2025 will spend less on government operations and reduce waste, so we can invest more to grow our economy, build more homes, and make life more affordable for you.

"COP 30: Tinubu Okays National Carbon Market Framework, Climate Fund","Ahead of the 30th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 30) in Brazil, President Bola Tinubu has approved the adoption of a National Carbon Market Framework, the operationalisation of the Climate Change Fund and the restoration of the National Council on Climate Change (NCCC) to the budget line. The goal was to establish and manage Nigeria’s participation in carbon markets, enabling the nation to unlock between $2.5billion and $3billion annually in carbon finance over the next decade to help meet climate goals. The approvals followed a presentation by the Director General of NCCC, Mrs Omotenioye Majekodunmi, at the second meeting of the Council held on Thursday evening at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. President Tinubu, who was represented by Vice President Kashim Shettima, said the approvals were part of measures by his administration to properly position Nigeria to leverage opportunities in the global carbon market and be more active in climate change ecosystem. According to a statement by presidential spokesman, Stanley Nkwocha, the Nigerian leader also set the agenda for Nigeria ahead of the forthcoming COP 30 scheduled for Belem, Brazil, saying the focus was to harness all of the opportunities for financing climate resilient projects and related interventions, particularly from the global carbon market. The President said his administration recognised the fact that addressing climate change was not just an environment imperative but an opportunity to unlock new investments, jobs and innovations across the nation’s energy, agriculture and industrial sectors. He said, “Nigeria stands ready to takes its rightful place as a global leader in climate action, ensuring that our voice and our reality are heard and respected in international negotiations. “We have demonstrated this commitment through our active participation in the UNFCCC process, our progress towards implementing our nationally determined contributions and our efforts to mobilize climate finance for adaption and mitigation across all levels of government.” The President assured that as chairman of the Council, climate action will continue to be prioritised in his administration’s development agenda. “We will continue to champion policies that protect our people, strengthen our economy and position Nigeria as a destination for green investment and innovation,” he added. Earlier, the Director-General of the National Council on Climate Change and Secretary to the Council, Mrs. Omotenioye Majekodunmi, informed the council chaired by Vice President Shettima, who represented President Tinubu, that the meeting was timely ahead of the 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 30) scheduled to hold in Brazil. She said the deliberations and decisions of the council would shape how Nigeria is perceived globally and determine how effectively the country can mobilize support to achieve its climate goals. The Council Secretariat expressed its commitment to providing the technical leadership and coordination needed to translate Nigeria’s climate goals into measurable results. Presenting the Council’s progress report, Majekodunmi disclosed that Nigeria is now eligible to access new rounds of climate finance from multilateral funds. Highlighting the Secretariat’s key requests, she said the Council sought the adoption of the National Carbon Market Framework to enable Nigeria unlock between $2.5 billion and $3 billion annually in carbon finance over the next decade. The Council also requested the operationaliszation of the Climate Change Fund to ensure immediate readiness for fund mobilisation and utilisation. The final request was for the Council to restore the NCCC budget line within the annual FAAC allocation to guarantee the financial stability of the Climate Change Fund. The Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, backed the Council Secretariat’s recommendations, noting that Nigeria must secure a strong position within the carbon framework. He assured the Council of the Finance Ministry’s support, including coordination with the ministry’s economic department to host a quarterly Climate Finance Tracking Dashboard.",2025-10-31 21:41:04,Leadership,positive,0.7253,-1,Outlier," President Bola Tinubu has approved the adoption of a National Carbon Market Framework, the operationalisation of the Climate Change Fund and the restoration of the National Council on Climate Change (NCCC) to the budget line .

Top Democrat presses Trump administration on Argentina 'bailout' during shutdown,"Rep. Jamie Raskin demands transparency from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the Trump administration's $40 billion Argentina deal. FIRST ON FOX: The top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee is demanding increased transparency from the Trump administration on the factors that led it to make its multibillion-dollar gamble on Argentina. In a letter sent Friday to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Robert Citrone, the manager of Discovery Capital Management LLC, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., requested details about their relationship after the Trump administration's announcement of the deal earlier this month. Raskin, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, asked to see any correspondence between Bessent and Citrone on Argentina, the investment and Citrone’s holdings in the country. ""It is imperative that the American people have a full understanding of why, in the midst of a government shutdown, this administration has chosen to orchestrate a $40 billion bailout to Argentina. What specific arrangements were made to accomplish this astounding result?"" Raskin wrote. TRUMP, DEMOCRATS LOCKED IN ENDLESS CYCLES OF PAYBACK AFTER COMEY INDICTMENT AND TARGETING PRESIDENT'S ENEMIES Citrone did not respond to several requests for comment. Russell Dye, a spokesperson for the Republican Judiciary Committee, said the letter represented just the most recent example of Democrats' fixation on critiquing the administration’s decisions. ""Democrats should focus on opening the government and paying federal workers, many of whom live in ranking member Raskin’s district, rather than obsessing over President Trump. But, sadly, their priority will always be attacking President Trump instead of paying the troops, air traffic controllers and families who are hurting,"" Dye said. FOX NEWS POLITICS NEWSLETTER: CORNYN'S 'CROOKED POLITICIANS' CRACKDOWN The Trump administration announced that it facilitated $20 billion in private financing for Argentina alongside a $20 billion currency swap, providing a financial backstop for a country that has struggled for years to find its footing amid high inflation. The investment aims to help Argentina manage its debts as the value of its currency, the Argentine peso, continues to fluctuate. The decision to direct American dollars toward Argentina raised accusations from Democrats that the investment carried political undertones meant to benefit Argentine President Javier Milei, a figure closely aligned with the Trump administration. Like Trump, Milei entered office in 2023 with promises to shrink the government’s footprint and bring down the country’s costs. But more than just the political undercurrents, Democrats like Raskin argue that some figures close to the administration — like Citrone — may receive collateral benefits as a result. ""In October 2024, you said that ‘the probability of default in Argentina is minuscule.’ Yet, in the past couple of months, a run on the Argentinian peso has put the country’s economy — and your hedge fund’s massive investments — on the brink of collapse. Suddenly, President Trump and Secretary Bessent announced the United States would take ‘exceptional measures’ to stabilize Argentina’s markets. The total amount of assistance for Argentina is a whopping $40 billion,"" Raskin wrote. Citrone and Bessent previously worked together for George Soros in 2013, according to statements Citrone made in a Goldman Sachs podcast. According to the reporting from the Securities and Exchange Commission , Discovery Capital’s exposure to Argentina is high, but not as high as it used to be. Discovery’s investments with companies based in or conducting business in Argentina have scaled down since December 2024. The fund’s investments in 2025 are tens of millions of dollars below levels from a year before. Citrone’s exposure in connection with Argentina is still north of $100 million, according to the SEC. RUBIO BLASTS 'DISHONEST' DEMOCRATS FOR TYING HIM TO 'FAKE' TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS In addition to demanding more information about Bessent's thinking on Argentina, Raskin blasted the decision to invest in Argentina during an ongoing, 31-day government shutdown. ""The Republican government shutdown has deprived millions of federal workers — including law enforcement and air traffic controllers — of their paychecks and is threatening government programs vital to the American people. But, in the midst of this government-created crisis, the Trump administration has chosen to arrange a $40 billion bailout to Argentina — half of it funded with taxpayer money,"" Raskin wrote.

But as Hyundai launches a new and improved version of its hydrogen car, the company’s UK president is urging the British government to recognise the technology as a key part of a “global hydrogen economy”. Not doing so could risk the UK being left behind. According to data from H2stations.org, at the end of 2024 there were 748 hydrogen refuelling stations in operation across Asia — China being the global leader with 384 locations across the country. Hyundai’s native South Korea is second, with 198 stations, and almost every service area along its motorway network now includes hydrogen refuelling. Europe is also investing in its hydrogen refuelling network, with 294 locations in operation across the Continent by the end of last year. Of these, 113 were in Germany, with 65 in France, 25 in the Netherlands and 19 in Switzerland. But the UK passenger car refuelling network is lagging behind, and the number of places to top up a hydrogen tank has gone into reverse in recent years. In 2019 there were ten publicly accessible H₂ filling stations in the UK, but today the figure stands at two: one at Heathrow (Hatton Cross) and the other in Tyseley, Birmingham. Two hydrogen fuel cell cars are on sale in the UK: the Toyota Mirai and the Hyundai Nexo. Hyundai says it has sold 40,000 Nexo cars worldwide, with its domestic market having the most sales. However, it is believed fewer than 20 have been registered in the UK since it was put on sale here in 2019, with most used as demonstration vehicles by companies with an interest in developing the hydrogen economy. The focus in the UK is shifting towards the operation of buses and commercial vehicles that support the demand for the growth of hydrogen, with existing and planned hydrogen hubs for these vehicles scattered around the country, including in Aberdeen, Dundee, the Tees Valley, Merseyside, Suffolk and south Wales. This follows more than £2 billion in government funding for 11 projects, including Whitelee Green Hydrogen in Scotland, one of whose customers will be the InchDairnie distillery in Fife, which is aiming to distil its whisky sustainably by 2027. The initial Hydrogen Allocation Rounds funding has also gone towards the Bradford Low Carbon project, which will use renewable electricity to power a 24.5mW alkaline electrolyser to supply clean hydrogen to the likes of JCB, and Wrightbus, which developed the world’s first hydrogen-powered double-decker bus. Twenty-seven projects were selected earlier this year for the second round of funding, known as HAR2, which includes £400 million of private sector investment. These could use hydrogen to decarbonise their manufacturing and industrial processes, including ammonia production, new clean power generation, glass manufacturing, brick-making, and sustainable aviation fuel production. Hyundai is banking on this commercial hydrogen economy growth alongside that of passenger cars. “Hydrogen will become a key pillar of the global clean energy ecosystem — not only in mobility, but also in energy and industry,” said Ashley Andrew, the UK president of Hyundai and its sister brand Genesis. “Hyundai views hydrogen as essential to achieving carbon neutrality, especially in sectors that are hard to fully electrify, such as commercial transport, logistics and industrial applications. “We expect hydrogen to expand beyond passenger vehicles into commercial vehicles, trains, maritime and even future home and industrial energy systems.” This week, Hyundai broke ground on a new hydrogen fuel cell production facility in Ulsan, South Korea, following an investment of nearly £500 million. The 43,000 sq m facility, which is set for completion in 2027, will mass-produce 30,000 fuel cell units annually. It will also include advanced polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysers. These split hydrogen from oxygen in water molecules, and the gas can then be compressed and stored in tanks. It’s the recombining of hydrogen with oxygen from the air in a fuel cell that generates electrical energy, with water being the by-product. PEMs run on renewable energy, such as solar, and transportation in zero-emission vehicles results in a green power ecosystem. When created via fossil fuels the resulting gas is known as grey, brown or black hydrogen, as the process is not genuinely clean. The Ulsan ground-breaking ceremony also involved hydrogen-powered vehicles, including lorries, excavators, boats, tractors and forklifts. “Hydrogen accelerates carbon neutrality by addressing the intermittency of renewables and enhancing energy resilience,” said Jaehoon Chang, the vice-chairman of Hyundai Motor Group. “Hydrogen also stands out as a strategic energy carrier, enabling localised generation and distribution systems — such as off-grid and micro-grid ecosystems — which reduce reliance on centralised grids and strengthen communities’ self-sufficiency.” Hyundai’s investment in the technology includes advances in efficiency for the new Nexo, with the fuel cell output up 11 per cent, battery output up 100 per cent and the electric motor output up 33 per cent compared with the previous-generation Nexo. Combined with aerodynamic improvements, its range on a single charge of hydrogen has increased from 414 miles to 513 miles, and the Nexo now has a towing capacity of up to 1,000kg (the previous model was not rated for towing at all). It takes about five minutes to refuel completely. The company is developing its hydrogen passenger cars alongside its hybrids and battery electric vehicles (Bevs), such as the Ioniq 5, the Ioniq 6 and the Kona Electric. Hyundai Motor Group also sells Bevs under the Kia and Genesis brands. The firm expects the two technologies to continue to coexist. “Bevs may be more suitable for short-distance applications without the need for quick charging, while FCEVs, with their exceptional energy density and rapid-refuelling capabilities, will conquer long and medium-haul trucking,” Andrew said. “The hydrogen industry remains in a growth phase and will continue to advance through close collaboration between industry and government, as public-private partnerships are key to expanding infrastructure. “To meet zero-emission vehicle mandates and accelerate fleet decarbonisation, government must recognise hydrogen as a strategic enabler, and maintain openness to all viable technologies that support medium to long-term climate goals.” CAR CLINIC October 23 2025, 1.20pm Tim Shallcross October 16 2025, 6.00pm Adam Hay-Nicholls car clinic October 07 2025, 8.00pm Tim Shallcross October 31 2025, 11.00pm David Green November 01 2025, 4.00am Anna Murphy, Fashion Director October 31 2025, 11.00pm Anna Murphy",2025-10-31 21:45:37,The Times,neutral,0.6034,28,Next_Greener_Future," Two hydrogen fuel cell cars are on sale in the UK: the Toyota Mirai and the Hyundai Nexo .

Republican Matt Van Epps touts strong support of Trump in Tennessee special congressional election,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — Republican nominee for US Congress Matt Van Epps touted his military service and endorsement from President Donald Trump in his primary victory and believes those factors will help him beat his Democratic opponent in the special congressional election. Van Epps is a West Point graduate who flew helicopter combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. He beat out a crowded Republican field with nearly 52% of the total Republican vote. Van Epps faces Aftyn Behn, the democratic nominee, are going head to head in a special election to fill the congressional seat vacated after republican Mark Green abruptly retired over the summer. On Inside Politics, Van Epps said President Trump's popularity remains strong across the seventh congressional district, which includes 14 counties and many rural areas that are home to soybean farmers, who right now, are being hit hard by tariffs. ""Soybean farmers, row crop farmers are struggling,"" Van Epps acknowledged. But added that he supports the President's use of tariffs. ""The president, who is the best negotiator in the world, is working to ensure we stop getting ripped off and that we have fair trade and I think in the long-term we are going to see benefits from that,"" Van Epps said. He's such a strong supporter of President Trump, that he did not rule out him serving a third term, despite the the Constitution limiting US presidents to a total of two terms. He was asked if he believes the Constitution applies to President Trump. ""The Constitution applies to everybody, but there are very deliberate processes for amending the Constitution and a pathway there, and those were built in by the founders, the framers,"" Van Epps said. His opponent, State Rep. Aftyn Behn, (D-Nashville), said a key difference between the two, is she would immediately call for full disclosure of convicted sex trafficker Jeffry Epstein's files. Van Epps said he supports the approach favored by the House Speaker and President Trump, who has told supporters there is nothing to see there. He was asked, ""The files are there, why not just release them?"" Van Epps responded, ""They are taking a deliberative approach with subpoena power so they can fully investigate the situation and hold those accountable that need to be held accountable for the heinous crimes that happened."" Behn said on Inside Politics last week that affordability and reversing the cuts from the ""Big Ugly Bill"" would be her focus. ""If you think things are going well, I am not your candidate. If you are upset with the cost of living and the chaos of our federal and state government, then I am your candidate,"" she said. Van Epps called Behn a ""socialist"" but said he would also focus on the economy. ""I think we are moving in a great direction, but we've got work to do. The cost of living is too high; inflation is still too high. The Republicans have advanced very sensible good solutions,"" Van Epps said. He said his first bill as a congressman, if we wins, would focus on helping veterans. The full interview with Matt Van Epps airs on Inside Politics, Friday at 7pm on NewsChannel 5 Plus and throughout the weekend. It is also available as a podcast, just enter ""Inside Politics Nashville"" and start listening. You can also listen to the entire interview with democrat Aftyn Behn from last week.

USC cutting 259 jobs as it tackles rising $230 million deficit,"The University of Southern California began cutting 259 jobs on Friday as it tackles a rising operating deficit of more than $230 million Since July 9, USC has laid off — or is in the process of terminating — 975 people throughout the university system’s nearly 24,600 faculty and staff. That tally doesn’t include 9,185 student workers. The university is “reducing and reorganizing its workforce due to cutbacks in funding and necessary budget reductions,” wrote Melissa Gerdes-Leonard, associate vice president of client services with USC’s human resources department, in an Oct. 27 letter filed with the state’s Employment Development Department. Also see: USC won’t sign Trump compact on federal funding The latest round of layoffs are happening at USC’s University Park, a leafy 229-acre main campus for the institution’s academic schools and residential buildings near Exposition Park in downtown Los Angeles. After the cuts are completed Dec. 31, USC will have shed 616 people on its main campus, or two-thirds of the workforce laid off to date. Some of the positions cut include a marketing director, procurement specialist, research administrator, office managers, library supervisor, event and facilities managers and instructional lab technicians. Gerdes-Leonard couldn’t be reached for comment, but USC spokesman Paul McQuiston confirmed the layoffs were coming as a result of the operating deficit and girding for cuts in federal funding. An update on the budget situation is expected next week. In a July 14 letter to faculty and staff, Interim President Byung-soo Kim announced spending cuts amid reductions to the university’s federal funding and inefficiencies to USC’s operating model. Kim reported the university lost more than $200 million in the 2025 fiscal year ending June 30, an increase from a $158 million deficit in 2024. Andrew Guzman, provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs, said at an Academic Senate meeting on Sept. 17 that USC had a projected structural deficit of $230 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. He outlined a plan of “personnel actions” and budget cuts to save $400 million through the end of the current fiscal year. Since the release of Kim’s letter in July, the scale of the layoffs has grown. The Viterbi School of Engineering laid off 55 professors, academic program directors, adjunct and clinical instructors and student services advisers, while the USC Health Sciences Campus laid off 151 — including several at the Keck School of Medicine, which includes a teaching hospital, specialized cancer hospital, community hospitals, and outpatient clinics throughout Southern California, and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center.

"Tinubu to Trump: Nigeria’s constitution protects every faith, intolerance is not our identity","President Bola Tinubu has rejected United States President Donald Trump’s decision to redesignate Nigeria as a “country of particular concern” over alleged religious persecution. In a statement on Saturday, Tinubu said Nigeria remains a democracy anchored on constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion and belief. “Nigeria stands firmly as a democracy governed by constitutional guarantees of religious liberty,” the president said. “The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.” Trump had on Friday announced via his Truth Social platform that Nigeria had been redesignated on the US religious freedom watchlist as a “country of particular concern”. The move follows growing criticism by some US lawmakers, American evangelical groups and lobbyists who allege persecution of Christians in parts of Nigeria. However, Tinubu described those claims as inaccurate and unhelpful, adding that his administration has maintained open and active engagement with leaders of both major religions since assuming office in 2023. “Since 2023, our administration has maintained an open and active engagement with Christian and Muslim leaders alike and continues to address security challenges which affect citizens across faiths and regions,” he said. Tinubu said his government continues to invest in security reforms to protect communities from terrorism and banditry, regardless of religious affiliation. He noted that violent groups operating in parts of the country target both Christians and Muslims, undermining national peace and unity. “Religious freedom and tolerance have been core tenets of our collective identity and shall always remain so. Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it,” the president said. He reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to collaborating with the US and other international partners to deepen understanding, promote coexistence, and strengthen mechanisms that protect vulnerable communities. “Our administration is committed to working with the United States government and the international community to deepen understanding and cooperation on protection of communities of all faiths,” Tinubu said. “Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths. Intolerance is not our identity.” Nigeria was first designated as a “country of particular concern” by the Trump administration in 2020 but was removed from the list in 2021 by former President Joe Biden.",2025-11-01 20:07:00,Nigeria News,neutral,0.5962,41,Concern_Decades_Security," President Bola Tinubu has rejected United States President Donald Trump’s decision to redesignate Nigeria as a “country of particular concern” over alleged religious persecution .

Loughrea edge neighbors St Thomas' in dramatic fashion in Galway SHC final,"Eanna Burke of St Thomas' in action against Kieran Hanrahan of Loughrea. Pic: Michael P Ryan/Sportsfile Galway SHC final: Loughrea 1-15 St Thomas’ 1-14 St Thomas’ suffered their first ever Galway SHC final defeat when they were edged out by their neighbours Loughrea at Pearse Stadium. St Thomas’ had won all eight previous finals but were chasing this one from the outset and never led in the contest played in difficult conditions in front of a crowd of 4,200. A goal in the final minute of regular time from Darren Shaughnessy proved decisive but St Thomas’ made them sweat all the way when Conor Cooney struck 1-1 in the dying minutes. St Thomas’ opted to play against the breeze in the opening half and found themselves 0-11 to 0-6 at the break with Loughrea getting off to a blistering start with points from Vince Morgan, Anthony Burns and Tiernan Killeen in the opening four minutes. The standard of hurling was good despite the wet and windy conditions and St Thomas’, with five players starting who had featured in all eight previous county title wins and another five on the bench with the full haul, used all their experience to get into the game. Conor Cooney got them off the mark with a point from play from 45 metres before captain Eanna Burke set up Darren Farrell for a point and cut the gap to 0-3 to 0-2 after nine minutes. Burns, who finished the opening half with four points from play, swapped scores with Cooney before Ian Hanrahan and Burns made it double scores at 0-6 to 0-3 at the end of the opening quarter. Loughrea, who had seven wides in the opening half with the wind, had a handful of goal chances but couldn’t convert against a St Thomas’ side who had only conceded one goal in their five games to the final. Another Cooney free, won by Eanna Ryan, reduced the margin but Loughrea hit a good patch and led by 0-9 to 0-4 after 25 minutes with Darren Shaughnessy, Burns and Vince Morgan finding the range. Farrell stemmed the flow with his second point but Loughrea led by five at the interval after Tiernan Killeen and Shane Morgan scored either side of Cooney’s third free for St Thomas’. Two frees from Cooney cut the gap to a goal inside three minutes of the restart but then after a free for all involving almost two dozen players, Loughrea extended their lead with efforts from Tiernan Killeen and Shaughnessy. Victor Manso became only the third St Thomas’ player to score when his point cut the gap to 0-13 to 0-9 after 43 minutes and Darragh Burke got the margin down to a goal going into the final quarter. Loughrea should have wrapped it up but Vince Morgan hit the crossbar after bearing down on goal and then moments later he flashed another goal effort wide from a tight angle from close range. The sides twice exchanged points before two more Cooney frees reduced the margin to 0-15 to 0-13 as the game went into the first of five minutes of stoppage time. Then Loughrea finally found the net when Burns set up Darren Shaughnessy and he soloed through to blast home from the left. But they were made sweat when Cooney landed a free and then blasted a free from 25 metres to the net in the final minute but Loughrea held on to retain their title. Scorers for Loughrea: D Shaughnessy 1-2, A Burns 0-5, T Killeen 0-3 (0-2f), S Morgan 0-2(0-2f), V Morgan 0-2, I Hanrahan 0-1.

"Sewing change, one bag at a time","In a province still drowning in polythene, despite ban, plastic bags continue to plague K-P Despite the ban on polythene bags, they are still being produced, sold, and used across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), laments Seema Babar, a social worker, who makes cloth bags and distributes them free of cost to people, in order to discourage the use of plastic bags and protect the environment from their harmful effects. Forty-nine-year-old Babar, from Pirpai village of Nowshera district in K-P is leading an initiative to reduce plastic waste in our society for the last some six years. “Few years ago, when the provincial government banned the manufacturing and sale of plastic bags in the province, I decided to make cotton bags and distribute them among people to raise awareness and promote the use of cloth bags, instead of plastic which cause pollution. “I first started this initiative in my village and later expanded the campaign to the main city and other parts of Nowshera district,” Seema Babar told The Express Tribune. She runs a women’s skill centre in her village, where women and young girls come to learn sewing and other handicraft skills. “During the training, the participants first make cloth bags using various types of raw and old fabric provided by relatives and neighbours. The bags carry anti-plastic and awareness slogans. After initial training, they practice stitching clothes and learn other skills,” she said. She added that in the past most plastic pollution was seen in urban areas, but now the waste can be observed in fields, crops, and irrigation channels in rural areas as well, affecting the environment where people once breathed fresh air and enjoyed lush greenery. “When the ban on use of plastic bags was imposed, people took our campaign seriously,” she says. “But over time, most of them do not pay attention to our cause and have gone back to using polythene bags.” While sharing people’s reactions, she said that when she and her team distributed cotton bags, many people accepted them with a smile, reflecting how a small group of females could change the community’s mindset to adopt reusable bags instead of plastic bags. According to Muhammad Tahir, a vegetable vendor in Mardan city, when the provincial government imposed a ban on polythene bags, the use of non-biodegradable bags decreased, and instead vendors and traders mostly began to use biodegradable plastic bags. “However, due to the low durability of biodegradable bags, lack of government monitoring, and customer demand, non-biodegradable bags have made a comeback and openly are used for daily shopping,” he added. A single cotton bag must be reused 50 to 150 times to have a lower environmental impact than a single-use plastic bag, according to a 2020 United Nations report. However, the exact number depends on the specific impact being measured, as a UK study found a cotton bag needs to be used 131 times to offset climate change, and thousands of times for comparable overall environmental impact. The effectiveness of cotton bags hinges on consumers consistently reusing them, as the production of one cotton bag is more energy-intensive than one plastic bag. Cotton bags have undoubtedly transformed consumer trends by offering a sustainable and practical alternative to single-use plastic bags. As consumers continue to prioritize sustainability in their purchasing decisions, the popularity of cotton bags is expected to grow even further, driving positive change towards a greener and more environmentally conscious future. By choosing cotton bags, consumers can make a tangible difference in reducing plastic waste and promoting a more sustainable way of life. In 2017, the provincial government of KP banned the use of polythene bags. However, after number of litigations, in 2022, amendments were introduced to the KP Environmental Protection Act 2014, which enforced a complete ban on plastic shopping bags across the province. According to officials of the KP Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), letters were dispatched to development authorities such as the Galiyat Development Authority, Kaghan Development Authority and Kumrat Development Authority to ensure implementation of the ban in all jurisdictions. All commissioners across the province were also directed to carry out operations against the use of these hazardous bags, they added. The EPA has prosecuted manufacturing units and wholesale dealers who violated the law, and soon these powers will be delegated to deputy and assistant commissioners as well, officials said. According to data obtained from The Water and Sanitation Services Company Peshawar (WSSP), the company collects about 500 tons of solid waste every day from 42 union councils of district Peshawar, which is then dumped at an authorised site on the outskirts of the provincial capital, Peshawar. The data shows that the waste consists of 10 percent plastic, 49 percent biodegradable materials, 9.4 percent paper, and 11 percent wood, among other materials. According to the company, the waste is scientifically managed by covering it with soil and spraying it before disposal. A sanitary landfill site has also been established to ensure that underground water reserves are not contaminated by the waste. Babar said that in the early days of the campaign, the district administration and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) supported her cause and extended their help, but over time, their interest has faded away. She added that even the use of biodegradable polythene bags has is not seen any more as people are seen using non-biodegradable bags which created pollution. “In the early days of the plastic bag ban, the district administration and NGOs arranged awareness sessions in different areas in which we also participated,” she says. “But now such activities are no longer taking place and we take the initiative to carry out awareness drives independently.” “Our mission to promote the use of cotton bags instead of plastic bags still continues,” Babar shares. “The women working at my centre, along with my neighbours and relatives, still use cotton bags, which is very important for raising awareness and discouraging the use of plastic bags.” According to United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 2023 report, Pakistan produced 3.9 million tonnes of plastic waste in 2020, over 65 per cent of which was mismanaged. The report also states that 18 per cent of municipal solid waste produced in Pakistan is plastics. Only three percent of plastic used by the manufacturing industry in Pakistan is recycled material. In 2019, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) imposed a ban on the manufacturing, import, sale, purchase, storage, and use of polythene bags in the Islamabad Capital Territory. About the adverse impact of polythene bags on the environment, professor Dr Muhammad Nafees Khan, a faculty member of the department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Peshawar, told The Express Tribune that the regular use of polythene bags was a major threat to the environment. He added that when they are burned, they cause air pollution, when they are thrown into rivers, they pollute the water and endanger aquatic life and when they are dumped in the earth, they cause reduced crop production. Dr Khan added that placing food items with a temperature from 20 to 25 degrees celsius in polythene bags can cause cancer in the human body, as cancer-causing aldehyde compounds leach from the bag into the food. “When plastic bags are exposed to ultraviolet radiation and water, they break down into microplastics, which, when entering the human body through breathing, can affect the lungs,” he said, adding that due to the choking of drainage systems, they are also causing urban flooding in city areas. He mentioned that the best alternative to these hazardous bags is cotton bags and stressed that raising awareness is very important for promoting their use. “To reduce and control plastic waste, discarded polythene bags should be converted into Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) for use in large industries such as steel mills, cement factories, and other industrial units that require high temperatures for production,” he suggests. “This approach will help keep the environment free from plastic waste, while industries will benefit from a cheaper source of energy.” Dr Syed Waqas Ali Shah, a faculty member in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, told The Express Tribune that plastic bags have a harmful impact on both climate change and natural habitats. Since polythene bags were made from fossil fuels, he explained that the industries that produce them emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming and air pollution. “Because of their easy use, the consumption of these hazardous bags is also on a large scale. According to a report, around one million plastic bags are used worldwide every minute. In developing countries like Pakistan, most of them are dumped in open areas instead of being recycled, which has adverse effects on the environment, ecosystems, and living beings as well,” he says. Syed Waqas Ali Shah pointed out that due to the rapid production of plastic bags in large quantities, more landfill space is occupied and dumping them on the ground causes frequent clogging of drains and waterways both in villages and city areas as its decomposition takes hundreds of years. He said that when those bags were flow into rivers and seas they polluted water and endangers marine life. “Many aquatic animals consume plastic bags thinking they are food, which affects their stomachs and intestines and often leads to their deaths. In the rivers of the Peshawar Valley, we once observed a population of turtles that has now almost vanished. In other countries, similar species have become rare due to the presence of plastic bags in rivers and seas,” Shah explained. He suggested that, along with the implementation of laws, raising public awareness about the hazards of polythene bags and imposing heavy taxes on their production is also crucial. As Babar’s village, Pirpai, is located near the Kabul River in Nowshera district, the residents are vulnerable to floods during the monsoon season. Apart from making cloth bags, Babar has also taken initiatives to address the adverse impacts of climate change, which have changed the pattern and severity of rainfall water level in rivers. “As the district youth coordinator, I have formed several groups of young women who receive training and visit local communities to raise awareness about climate change, tree plantation, energy saving and water conservation in Nowshera district,” she shares, adding that these members also arrange free plants for plantation drives and coordinate with the district administration to take part in government sessions.

Europe Leads the Charge on Aviation Sustainability with SAF Mandates and Innovation,"Published on November 2, 2025 Europe is steadily advancing toward greener skies, with the aviation industry accelerating its shift towards sustainability. The key driver? Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a biofuel made from renewable resources that reduces carbon emissions and is integral to achieving Europe’s ambitious carbon-neutral goals. With recent regulations, such as the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, the aviation industry is witnessing a transformative shift in fuel consumption.What Are SAF Mandates?Advertisement Since January 2025, European airports have been mandated to blend a minimum of 2% SAF with conventional jet fuel. This percentage will increase incrementally, reaching 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. These regulations are part of the European Union’s broader strategy to decarbonize the aviation sector. ReFuelEU Aviation, an EU regulation first drafted in 2021, aims to make SAF the primary fuel for aircraft departing from European airports, bolstering sustainable aviation while fostering innovation and growth in the biofuel sector.The Role of SAF in DecarbonizationAdvertisement The EU’s SAF mandate plays a critical role in achieving the aviation industry’s carbon neutrality by 2050. Aviation contributes significantly to global emissions, and while carbon offsetting strategies exist, SAF provides a tangible solution for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint. As SAF production scales, its environmental benefits will only increase, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and helping meet global climate goals.Challenges to SAF Production and the Need for InvestmentAdvertisement Despite the positive impact of SAF, production in Europe is not without its hurdles. SAF is still in its early stages of development, and Europe’s capacity to produce it is far from meeting the growing demand. The cost of SAF production is high, and regulatory uncertainty remains. While countries like the US have provided financial incentives to encourage SAF production, Europe’s reliance on regulatory measures, like the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, falls short in addressing the upfront investment challenges faced by SAF producers.Europe’s SAF Supply Chain Needs StrengtheningThe current SAF supply chain in Europe is still underdeveloped. While demand is increasing, the supply remains limited, creating an imbalance in the market. Europe’s refineries are adapting to produce SAF, but with geopolitical challenges and concerns about feedstock supply chains, such as the reliance on used cooking oil, the region faces risks that may hinder long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, policymakers must focus on strengthening the SAF supply chain through incentives, clearer legislative frameworks, and better financial backing.Aviation Leaders Push for Clearer LegislationThe aviation industry is committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but experts argue that more coordinated financial support is needed. Business aviation manufacturers and industry stakeholders have urged the EU to simplify regulations and provide stronger financial incentives. According to Kyle Martin, VP of European affairs at the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), a shift in focus towards innovation and competitiveness, rather than solely sustainability, is vital for achieving both goals.At the same time, European authorities have expressed caution about the pace of SAF development. In February 2025, the Airports Council International (ACI) Europe warned that further EU support was necessary to meet the ambitious targets set for 2050. The alliance called for a more comprehensive SAF industrial policy, increased financing, and a reduction in the regulatory burden.The Future of SAF in Europe: Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and Next-Generation FuelsAs Europe looks to expand its SAF production capabilities, next-generation fuels are gaining attention. Power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, produced using green hydrogen and carbon feedstocks, offer a promising alternative to current SAF pathways. Europe is exploring these innovative solutions as part of its commitment to reducing reliance on traditional fossil fuels. While PtL fuels hold significant potential, they are still in the pilot phase, and scaling up production will require substantial investment and technological advancements.Opportunities for Travelers: A Greener Way to FlyFor global travelers, the shift towards SAF means cleaner air travel options in the future. Major airports in Europe, including Paris Le Bourget, London Luton, and London Farnborough, are leading the way in SAF adoption. As demand grows, airports and airlines are working to ensure SAF availability for passengers. This transition not only benefits the environment but also aligns with travelers’ increasing desire for sustainable travel options.By supporting the adoption of SAF, travelers can contribute to a greener aviation industry while enjoying the benefits of cleaner, more sustainable flights. As Europe’s aviation industry navigates these challenges and opportunities, the future of air travel looks brighter and more eco-friendly than ever.Conclusion: Europe’s Bold Steps Towards a Sustainable Aviation FutureEurope’s commitment to sustainable aviation through SAF mandates is a significant step in the fight against climate change. While challenges remain in scaling production, the EU’s proactive approach is setting the stage for a greener future. By prioritizing SAF, Europe is not only reducing aviation emissions but also paving the way for a global shift towards sustainable travel.

Europe’s refineries are adapting to produce SAF, but with geopolitical challenges and concerns about feedstock supply chains, such as the reliance on used cooking oil, the region faces risks that may hinder long-term sustainability.

TV scores twice in second half to claim title,"Twin Valley and Caledonia United battled through a scoreless first half and after more than 10 minutes ticked off the second-half clock, fans had to be wondering if a goal would ever come. Then it happened on Brayden Brown's direct kick from about 20 yards 11:11 into the second half. ""We thought (at halftime) that we would score on a set piece. We work on those ad nauseum,"" Twin Valley coach Buddy Hayford said. Brown's ball that went just under the crossbar before rippling the high portion of the net was the impetus for the 2-0 victory and the Wildcats' state championship. Brown said he practices direct kicks at different distances. ""It felt good,"" Brown said of the moment the ball left his foot. ""I bent it a little bit. ""I was visioning it going under the bar and into the net."" Brown knew it had to be a great shot to beat Cal United goalie Josh Peterson. ""He is a really good keeper. He made some great saves,"" Brown said. Petersen was so good that he prompted Hayford to change his game plan at halftime. ""We made an adjustment because their keeper was so mobile,"" Hayford said. ""He was able to pick everything off so we stopped being so vertical and instead played the ball wide. We stopped playing through balls and made more angle passes."" A one-goal lead with that much time remaining did little to calm Hayford's nerves. ""The second goal was the thing. I didn't feel good about a one-goal lead against a team like that. They were 16-0 and very good,"" Hayford said. The insurance goal came with 13:04 remaining, a low bullet into the corner off the foot of Niko Gerding. ""Niko's shot was awesome. He kept it low and it was against the keeper's momentum,"" Hayford said. One reason the pad goal was so long in coming was a strong Cal defense spearheaded by Monaco. He had several clears under very heavy pressure. Early in the game, Hayford had to admit he was given some doubt about the Wildcats chances to take down the undefeated opponent. That was because his team lost two-time All State center back Chris Eckert and he never did return. ""I said at that time, 'we could be in trouble,'"" Hayford said. But the Wildcats passed the next-man-up mentality with flying colors. Zack Mercier stepped into fill Eckert's role. ""He was terrific,"" Hayford said. Colton Corey saw more minutes after the injury. ""He was untested but played very well,"" Hayford said. ""And Brian Sullivan won balls in the back."" Brayden Brown and Gerding were stellar in controlling the midfield area just as they had been all year. ""Carson McHale was a bulldog up front and his motor ran all 80 minutes,"" Hayford said. Cal United coach Peter Stratman said that to him, the game had the feel of one where the team scoring first would win. ""I thought there was a momentum shift after they scored,"" Stratman said. Stratman knows that could have just as well been one of his players finding the net first. During an even first half, they threatened goalie Kaelyn Lackey and his defense several times. Caledonia applied early pressure with River Thibault getting a good, unobstructed look and firing barely wide of the far post after only two minutes had elapsed. ""The game was frenetic in the first 10 minutes and then when everyone settled down it was an even game for the rest of the first half,"" Stratman said. Eli Russell unloaded a testing shot that Lackey made a great deflection of and Cal United came close to capitalizing on the rebound. Cal also had some scoring opportunities in the first half on balls that ping ponged around in the box, something that did not please Hayford. ""No bouncing balls in the back. We've got clear them out with our heads. If we don't, it is going to cost us,"" Hayford yelled to his defenders. But the half ended without a goal and, out of respect for Petersen, Hayford altered the method of attacking. The adjustment gave the Wildcats a significant territorial advantage as they clearly won the second 40 minutes. Cal United, a team that boasts players from Danville, Twinfield and Cabot, took the loss hard. A defeat in a state title game is never easy and it only compounds the hurt when you aren't accustomed to losing. Caledonia went through the season beating all comers and took the same 16-0 record that Twin Valley brought into Saturday night's championship game. Playing their final game for Cal United were seniors Russell, Jola Otten, Ben Monaco, Sean Lehoe, Samson Kitonga, Sam McLane, Alijah Andrews and Petersen. They couldn't appreciate being an unbeaten team all regular season. The sting of this night was still too much. But they will eventually. It was a magical season. Twin Valley seniors Lackey, Eckert, Tucker Magnant, Steven Oyer, Pacei Reynolds, McHale, Max Nido, Nrian Sullivan and Max Mercier went out the way everyone wants to go out the door. But only team can. It was the Twin Valley Wildcats. Twin Valley fan Frances Cunningham delivered a beautiful rendition of the national anthem, but the song that will stay with the Wildcat players forever was ""We Are the Champions"" by Queen as it blared over the loudspeaker at Rutland's Alumni Field. tom.haley@rutlandherald.com Sportswriter",2025-11-01 20:43:00,Rutland Herald,neutral,0.5381,62,Goal_Hockey_Glennon," Brayden Brown's direct kick from about 20 yards helped Twin Valley defeat Caledonia United 2-0 .

Bihar JD(U) candidate Anant Singh arrested over Jan Suraaj worker's death in Mokama,"Controversial former Bihar MLA Anant Singh , who seeks to reclaim Mokama seat on a ticket of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), was arrested in a late-night operation on Saturday (November 1, 2025) in connection with the murder of Jan Suraaj supporter Dular Chand Yadav, officials said. Mr. Singh, who has been under the scanner since the killing of Yadav, who recently clashed with his sympathisers, was picked up from his house in Barh, about 200 km from the State capital. Police also arrested two other persons, Manikant Thakur and Ranjeet Ram, who were also present when the incident took place. All three will soon be produced before the magistrate. Yadav died while campaigning for Jan Suraaj Party’s candidate Piyush Priyadarshi in Patna’s Mokama area on Thursday. The incident had taken place in the Mokama Taal area, which is close to Bhadaur and Ghoswari police stations. The incident had taken place close to the Bhadaur and Ghoswari police stations in the Mokama area. Addressing a late-night joint press conference with Patna District Magistrate Thyagarajan S. M., Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Patna, Kartikeya Sharma, said, “Police have arrested three persons — Anant Singh, Manikant Thakur and Ranjeet Ram — in connection with the murder of Dular Chand Yadav.” According to Yadav’s post-mortem report, he died of cardiorespiratory failure due to shock caused by injury to the heart and lungs by a hard and blunt substance, the SSP said. “Therefore, the post-mortem report and preliminary investigation suggest that it’s a case of murder,” he said. Investigations also revealed that all three were present at the time of the incident, Mr. Sharma said. “They have been arrested as part of a police investigation into the murder case of Yadav. A total of four FIRs, one pertaining to the violation of the model code of conduct, have been registered by the police to investigate the incident,” the SSP said, adding that Singh was named in one of the FIRs. The multiple-term former MLA, whose wife Neelam Devi currently represents the Mokama seat, has also been booked for model code of conduct violation as instances of his moving about in large cavalcades have come to the fore. When asked about the killing of Yadav, Mr. Singh had admitted to a clash between his supporters and the deceased, but also sought to put the blame on Suraj Bhan, his old rival in the underworld and local politics, whose wife Veena Devi is contesting the seat on an RJD ticket. Yadav, a dreaded gangster of the 1990s known to be at odds with Anant Singh, was supporting Priyadarshi Piyush, a political greenhorn fielded by Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party. Meanwhile, the Election Commission on Saturday ordered the transfer of Patna Superintendent of Police (Rural) and action against three other officials, taking a stern view of violence in Mokama, involving the killing of Yadav. “The Commission directed that Vikram Sihag, Superintendent of Police (Rural), Patna, may also be transferred. Hence, a panel of officers for posting a substitute in his place may be sent urgently,” the poll authority told the state chief electoral officer on Saturday. It ordered the appointment of new officials to replace the sub-divisional officer of Barh, who is also the returning officer of Mokama assembly seat, sub-divisional police officer Barh-1, and sub-divisional police officer Barh-2. While ordering disciplinary proceedings against the three, it also directed that Abhishek Singh, the sub-divisional police officer of Barh-2, be also placed under suspension.

Pakistan reopens Afghan border as ceasefire holds,"US Torkham border reopens for repatriation; Thousands return home via Chaman border Pakistan on Saturday reopened the Torkham border crossing in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa for Afghan refugees returning to their country, ending a nearly two-week closure following deadly clashes between border forces last month. Meanwhile, nearly 10,700 individuals returned through the Chaman border in a single day as authorities expanded the process to the crossing. The repatriation of Afghan families with or without any travel or identity documents was abruptly suspended on October 11 following border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which continued for days before a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on October 19. Pakistan had closed all its borders with Afghanistan for all types of movement. Since then, a large number of returning families had been impatiently waiting for the reopening of the Torkham border. Trade between the countries has remained suspended since then, leading to increased prices of essential goods, especially tomatoes. Although Islamabad and Kabul on Friday decided to extend the ceasefire, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi stated that the ""border remains closed for trade for now"" and resumption of trade would depend on the security situation. Officials previously said that all relevant staff members had been informed to ensure their presence on duty on Saturday morning. It was not clear whether Pakistanis stranded in Afghanistan would be allowed to return. According to official figures, approximately 1.56 million Afghan nationals have now returned to their homeland under the government's ongoing repatriation drive. The process was being conducted in accordance with legal and administrative protocols, ensuring that every individual's documents are verified before crossing the border. Authorities assured that the repatriation initiative was being carried out in a dignified and orderly manner and has now been extended to Torkham following its recent reopening. Officials said the Frontier Corps (FC) and the civil administration have set up temporary shelters, food supplies, and medical facilities for departing families. The state has ensured that all humanitarian needs of Afghan refugees are addressed during the transition, an official said. Similarly, Khyber Deputy Commissioner Bilal Rao confirmed the reopening, saying that the crossing had resumed operations to facilitate the repatriation of Afghan nationals. Afghan and Pakistani officials, including Khizer Shah, spokesperson of the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul, also verified the development. The repatriation process for Afghan families, both with and without valid travel or identity documents, had been suspended since October 11, when cross-border clashes broke out between security forces of the two countries. The border skirmishes, which lasted several days, were halted only after a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on October 19. Following the violence, Pakistan had closed all border crossings with Afghanistan for both trade and travel, leaving thousands of returning families stranded on either side. The shutdown also disrupted bilateral trade, triggering a spike in prices of essential goods, particularly perishable items like tomatoes, in local markets. Although Islamabad and Kabul agreed on Friday to extend the ceasefire, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the border remains closed for trade for now, adding that commercial activity would resume only after a review of the security situation. According to officials in Khyber, all relevant border staff had been directed to report for duty early Saturday to facilitate the return of refugees. However, it was not immediately clear whether Pakistani nationals stranded in Afghanistan would also be allowed to cross back into the country.

'India tried to bribe Pak fisherman into spying',"US He drew parallels between, failed Operation Sindoor, current propaganda campaign Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Saturday revealed that India's intelligence agency had attempted to recruit a Pakistani fisherman for espionage by offering him money. Addressing a joint press conference in Islamabad alongside Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, Chaudhry said the incident was ""India's new propaganda operation, which has now been fully exposed"". He said the fisherman, identified as Ijaz Mallah, had been detained by the Indian Coast Guard in September and was subsequently coerced and bribed with Rs95,000 to take part in anti-Pakistan propaganda. ""This is part of a continuous psychological and informational war being waged by Indian intelligence agencies against Pakistan,"" he said, adding that the country's security institutions remain vigilant to counter such attempts. Chaudhry credited Pakistan's media and security institutions for ""ensuring the triumph of truth in this information war,"" and praised their responsible reporting in the face of what he termed ""yellow propaganda"". He drew parallels between the failed Operation Sindoor and the current propaganda campaign, describing them as repeated attempts by India to ""erase the humiliation of past failures"". ""After failing in Operation Sindoor, and even in sports arenas, efforts have continued to create false narratives, from fabricated operations to fake encounters. But every such attempt has been exposed,"" he said. The minister added that evidence of financial transactions and communication between Indian handlers and Mallah had been recovered. He said fake media credentials, uniforms and documents were also used to mask the operation under seemingly credible identities. He stressed Pakistan was a responsible state, saying, ""Pakistan respects the sovereignty of other nations and ensures its soil is not used against anyone. We expect the same in return"". He urged the international community and independent media to review the evidence and recognise the operation for what it was, ""a desperate bid to build a false narrative ahead of elections and amid growing political tensions in India"". ""Just like in the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the truth is once again before the world. India has been caught red-handed,"" Chaudhry added.

President salutes heroes who liberated G-B,"US Zardari vows to make Gilgit-Baltistan a model region President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday joined the people of Gilgit-Baltistan in marking the region's 78th Independence Day, paying glowing tribute to the heroes who liberated G-B from Dogra rule and reaffirming the government's resolve to turn the region into a model of development, justice and equality. Addressing the central ceremony held at the Army Helipad Ground in Gilgit, President Zardari lauded the people of G-B for standing shoulder to shoulder with the rest of Pakistan for more than seven decades, safeguarding its borders and carrying the national flag to the world's highest peaks. ""This region is not only the crown of Pakistan but also our northern gateway, a symbol of lasting friendship with China,"" he said. He said the Karakoram Highway stands as a living testament to that friendship, while the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has brought new avenues for trade, livelihoods and connectivity throughout the region. The president emphasised that ensuring the fruits of development reach every valley and village must remain a shared national goal, fostering prosperity for all. The president said G-B's freedom struggle serves as a reminder of the unfinished journey of their ""brothers and sisters"" in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). ""While you enjoy liberty and rights under the flag of Pakistan, they continue to face occupation and repression,"" he said. ""We stand with them till they achieve freedom in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions and their own aspirations."" Calling G-B his ""second home"", the president recalled that the people of the region gained their independence through their own struggle and voluntarily chose to join Pakistan. He said the history of G-B was filled with acts of unmatched bravery and sacrifice, noting that during the liberation movement of 1947, 1,700 people embraced martyrdom and another 30,000 were wounded. He highlighted that successive PPP governments had made landmark contributions to G-B's progress. ""Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto showed his affection for the people of G-B by abolishing the Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR) in 1974 and merging princely states into a single administrative unit,"" he said. ""Later, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto introduced a structural governance system, and the PPP federal government gave G-B a legislative assembly and the offices of governor and chief minister through constitutional amendments."" Zardari said PPP workers from G-B had also played an active role in the country's democratic struggles, with many sacrificing their lives in Karachi and Rawalpindi. He urged the authorities to expand access to education and healthcare throughout the region and said G-B's vast water and natural resources could be utilised for power generation. The area, he added, held immense tourism potential and could even operate its own airline to promote it. The president denounced the persecution of Muslims in India and praised Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah for creating a separate homeland where all citizens could enjoy freedom and dignity. Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, in his address, paid tribute to the martyrs of the 1947 liberation movement and thanked President Zardari for gracing the ceremony. He said the PPP government's 2009 reforms had given G-B its identity and added that integrating the region into Pakistan's constitutional framework – without undermining the Kashmir issue – would thwart India's malicious designs. The chief minister lauded the sacrifices of Pakistan's armed forces and the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir, noting that Operation Bunyan al-Marsoos had further strengthened G-B's security and prestige. President Zardari later reviewed the parade and witnessed a colourful march-past and cultural floats representing all three divisions of G-B, which drew loud applause from the audience. The event was attended by the governor, chief minister, members of the legislative assembly, Commander X Corps Lt Gen Ahsan Amir Nawaz, Force Commander Northern Areas Maj Gen Syed Imtiaz Gilani, senior officials, and a large number of citizens. Earlier, the president was warmly received at Gilgit Airport by Governor Syed Mehdi Shah and the chief minister.

"Extend ITR filing due date, HC tells CBDT","The Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to extend the due date for filing Income Tax Returns (ITR) for assessees who are required to submit audit reports. The order has been pronounced by Justice Lisa Gill and Justice Meenakshi I Mehta on four writ petitions filed by the Jalandhar Income Tax Bar Association, Taxation Bar Association, Pathankot, and Income Tax practitioners. They approached the high court seeking a direction to the CBDT to extend the due date for filing of tax audit reports for a reasonable period from September 30 and as a necessary corollary to further extend the due date for filing tax returns. Counsels for petitioners submitted that audit reports and tax returns are mandatorily to be e-filled. Forms of e-filing of audit report and tax returns were made available effectively by the department only in August, thereby leading to considerable reduction of time period available to petitioners for filing tax audit reports. Certain changes were carried out in respect to tax audit reports vide notification dated March 28, 2025, however, e-filing utility was made available on August 14. The department itself acknowledged substantial changes and time required for system readiness when it extended due date for filing of tax returns in certain categories of persons other than companies. The Bench said repeated adjournments had been granted at fervent request of counsel for the Union of India on the premise that proposal regarding extension of due date for filing of Income Tax Returns in the case of auditable assessees for sssessment year 2025-26 is under submission for early decision. Position is no different even today despite of specific and categorical order dated October 13 passed by the High Court of Gujarat, which has admittedly been attained finality. The Bench said, “We find no ground whatsoever to further adjourn these writ petitions as has been suggested. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances as above, all four writ petitions are disposed of while directing respondent – the CBDT to issue necessary circular in exercise of power under Section 119 of the Act to extend the due date for filing of returns by assessees required to file audit report as per clause (a) of Explanation 2 to sub-section (1) of Section 139 of the Act or required to file report of audit under provisions of the Act for financial year 2024-2025 (Assessment year 2025-26) to November 30, 2025.

"International experts show interest in importing fruits, cut flowers from Bilaspur","The Himachal Pradesh Sub-tropical Horticulture, Irrigation and Value Addition Project (HP SHIVA) has drawn international attention of a high-profile business delegation from Dubai comprising Abdulla Al Ali and Sagheer Khan, who visited the state and held a high-level meeting with Project Director Dr Devender Singh Thakur, in Bilaspur today. An HP SHIVA Project Management Unit (PMU) team of the Directorate of Horticulture was also present at the meeting. Dr Thakur said the meeting focused on exploring export opportunities for fruits, including sweet oranges, pomegranates and cut flowers, including roses and carnations, produced under the HP SHIVA Project to Middle East markets, especially Dubai. He said a detailed overview of the project’s progress and achievements was given to the international guests. He said scientifically developed horticulture clusters had been established across seven districts in the state, including Bilaspur, Hamirpur, Kangra, Mandi, Una, Solan, and Sirmaur. These clusters cultivate high-yield and export-oriented varieties that meet all international standards of colour, size, sweetness and shelf life, he said. Dr Thakur said farmers were trained in good agricultural practices (GAP), precision irrigation, fertigation and integrated pest and nutrient management. He said, “There is a remarkable improvement in both the quality and consistency of production. The cluster-based model has enabled product traceability, quality consistency and volume aggregation that are key prerequisites for international buyers.” During inspection of the Karot cluster in Bilaspur, the Dubai representatives appreciated the quality of the produce, describing it as being on par with international standards, and expressed strong interest in establishing long-term export partnerships with the HP SHIVA initiative.

Alonzo Highsmith Has Interest in Dolphins GM Job,"Posted by Mike Oliva | Nov 1, 2025 | 2025 Season, Dolphins News | 0 Alonzo Highsmith Has Interest in Dolphins GM Job Former Miami Hurricanes running back and current New England Patriots personnel executive Alonzo Highsmith has expressed interest in the open Miami Dolphins general manager position to people, according to Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald. Highsmith was the 3rd overall pick of the 1987 NFL Draft by the Houston Oilers. During his NFL career, he played for Houston, Dallas, and Tampa. He also spent time on the Kansas City Chiefs practice squad his final year before retiring. Since retiring, Highsmith has pivoted and become an NFL Front Office executive. He got his start in Green Bay as a Senior Personnel Executive from 2012 to 2017. Then he moved to Seattle, where he was the Vice President of Player Personnel from 2018 to 2019. From 2020 to 2022, he was a personnel executive in Seattle. Then, in late 2022, he went back home to the Miami Hurricanes to be their GM of Football Operations for two seasons. And then in 2024, he became a personnel executive with the New England Patriots. At 60 years old, Highsmith is undoubtedly qualified to be an NFL general manager at this stage of his career, and the fact that he has spent time in two highly successful NFL front offices makes him an attractive candidate. With that said, there is no confirmation or report of Miami having interest in Highsmith; this is coming from Alonzo himself that he has interest in the open position. I fully expect the Miami Dolphins to cast a wide net in their search come January when they begin the process of finding a new general manager. It was reported Saturday morning by Dianna Russini that Miami is looking to reshape the vision of its front office, so do not expect Miami to only meet with a couple of people and make a quick hire come January 2026. I suspect this will drag out some, and the search will go into February, and we may not have an announcement on any new hire until around or after the Super Bowl. One thing that is ironic about this story is that before being hired by the Miami Dolphins as a scout in 2000, Chris Grier had worked for the Patriots. Like Highsmith does now.

"Shein Might Be Cheap, But Is It Legit?","Global e-commerce retailer Shein is known for offering cheap fashion. Not only are the items themselves priced quite low, but just going on the website's homepage, you are bombarded with pop-ups and other internal advertisements about the latest Shein sales and deals. Are the savings, however, worth it? Are you getting legitimate, high-quality fashion for a good price? It doesn't seem that way. Shein is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and only has a one-star customer review rating based on over 700 reviews on its website. Shein has also been involved in multiple lawsuits during its history. These lawsuits center on other fashion brands and artists accusing Shein of selling counterfeit products and stealing their designs. So that Coach handbag you found on Shein might not actually be Coach at all. Based in China, Shein was founded in 2008 by Chris Xu. It got its start selling wedding dresses before expanding into all of women's fashion and other miscellaneous products. It's grown to be a popular app, with billions in revenue and multiple manufacturing partnerships. It adds thousands of new items to its store daily, which can often be a red flag for quantity over quality. While you might be getting a good deal shopping at Shein — similar to Amazon's discount store Haul — it's a stretch to claim that this company is completely legit. Since Shein is not accredited by the BBB, it has not gone through the process to meet the organization's eight Standards for Trust. These standards include honest advertising, transparent business policies, responding quickly to disputes, and safeguarding customer data. While this does not necessarily mean Shein is dishonest and negligent, earning a BBB accreditation does go a long way in winning customer faith in a company's products and services. Customers are allowed to post their good and bad experiences with companies on the BBB page, even though it's not accredited. Shein's 1-star rating out of 5 possible stars is a strikingly dismal score. Complaints include items ordered not arriving and no money being returned, the wrong items being delivered, and counterfeit items that don't match the website description. It is worth noting, however, that Shein has an A rating on the BBB. The reason given is that Shein responds to customer complaints quickly. Letter grade ratings on the BBB are a direct reflection of the business's responsiveness to upset customers and are not influenced by reviews posted on the website. For comparison, three companies in Canada have earned F ratings. So when you take the whole package of no BBB accreditation, an A rating for responsiveness, and multiple customer complaints, you get a fuller picture of what to expect from shopping with Shein. Tapestry, the company that owns the fashion brand Coach, sued Shein in 2025, accusing the company of having third parties manufacture counterfeit Coach products and sell them on the website. These counterfeit items featured the Coach name and its well-known logo. In response, Shein claimed all of its products from third-party suppliers were legitimate and not knock-offs. Large companies aren't the only ones that feel their designs have been stolen by Shein. Small, independent fashion designers have also complained online about their handmade fashions being mass-produced by third parties through Shein without their permission. Shein has also been accused of copying the direct design of products, like Bottega Veneta's Cassette bag, often worn by celebrities. Shoppers may feel that they are getting a Hollywood-level bag at an ultra-cheap price. Unfortunately, there is little legal protection available for copies of unique designs outside of trademarked logos or similar brand-defining visuals. To Shein's credit, its ethical policies are stated clearly on its website. It emphasizes that its mission is to conduct business lawfully and responsibly. This includes the suppliers it works with agreeing to a set of standards and large sections about its commitment to safe work practices and no worker exploitation — the same type of issue that Temu has come under fire for. If you do shop at Shein, remember that sometimes a deal that seems too good is, in fact, too good to be true.",2025-11-01 21:17:00,Bgr,neutral,0.4095,-1,Outlier, E-commerce retailer Shein is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau .

Why Kourtney Kardashian Is Reportedly ‘Upset’ With Kim And Khloé Amid New Season Of Their Reality Show,"The Kardashians started airing for fans with a Hulu subscription last week and, given the nature of the show, it's natural to expect drama. While in front of the camera, the Kardashian-Jenner family is pretty transparent and tends to be confrontational with each other. If a source is to be believed, though, Kourtney Kardashian is now unhappy about comments made by her sisters Kim and Khloé during their confessionals. For context, during the season premiere of The Kardashians, "" Feel Like the Old Days,"" Kourtney made a snide remark about her sisters wearing corsets and tall heels while playing with their children. She suggested that she is way more comfortable in Travis Barker-esque casual clothes and made it clear she thought her sisters were silly for thinking otherwise. Ultimately, Khloé and Kim clocked the dig against them immediately, and Kim decided to share the following comments in her confessional: Good for you babe. I don’t come in and say like ‘Huh, I would never give up on life so soon.' You know, saying the opposite. It’s the passive aggressive for me. Considering Kim Kardashian said that in a confessional, Kourtney didn’t hear the ""giving up on life"" remark until the episode aired. Sometime later, a source spoke with Entertainment Tonight, telling the outlet that Kourtney was not happy after the seventh season of The Kardashians premiere. When it comes to the mother of four's alleged feelings on the matter, the source tells ET: Kourtney's been a little upset with Kim and Khloé since the new season of 'The Kardashians' started airing. She didn't know Kim made that 'giving up on life' remark and she felt really bothered by it. While the Kardashian sisters are known for bickering quite a bit, which has been showcased over the 20+ seasons of their various reality shows, things between Kourtney's relationship with the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner family has allegedly been fraught over the last few years. Kourtney and Kim especially have been at odds with each other. Everything seemed to escalate after they had a major blow-up in 2018 when Kim called Kourtney the “least exciting to look at.” Oh Man, Was Scott Disick Trolling Kim Kardashian Over Her Viral Comments About Not Knowing The Cost Of Milk? Later in 2022 when Kim Kardashian worked with Dolce and Gabbana, Kourney became upset, saying that Kim was copying her wedding style. They eventually reconciled but, since then, Kourtney has made comments about her sisters’ business strategies in general and has been critical of their value systems. Such sentiments would seemingly indicate that this conflict runs a lot deeper than a Dolce and Gabbana campaign. This repeated negative energy between the two Kardashians has allegedly caused Kourtney to distance herself from the rest of her family. As a result, she's opted out of a lot of family occasions in favor of spending more time with her husband, Travis Barker, and their immediate family. This also has been a point of contention, which may or may not be linked to the comments Khloé and Kim made about their sister. This tension feels like a through line for this upcoming season, and I’m thinking these outfit comments will could set the stage for what's to come in upcoming episodes. Hulu: 30-Day Free TrialBoth Hulu's Ad-Supported and Ad-Free tiers give subscribers access to various shows, including The Kardashians.

"Two arrested after multiple people stabbed on train, police say","British Transport Police said they were responding to an incident on a train to Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. Two people have been arrested after a number of people were stabbed on a train to a Cambridgeshire town, police have said. Cambridgeshire Constabulary said armed police attended after officers were called to the scene at Huntingdon station at 7.39pm on Saturday. The Prime Minister said the incident was “deeply concerning” and urged people to follow police advice. In a statement on X, Sir Keir Starmer said: “The appalling incident on a train near Huntingdon is deeply concerning. “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. “Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police.” Video footage on social media showed scores of blue-light police cars and emergency vehicles in a station car park, and a team of armed police running towards the stationary train at Huntingdon station. Witnesses described seeing a man with a large knife, and passengers hiding in the toilets to escape the rampage, The Times reported. One witness told the paper there was “blood everywhere” and people were getting “stamped” on by others as they tried to flee. “I heard some people shouting we love (you),” the witness said. In their statement, British Transport Police said on X: “We are currently responding to an incident on a train to Huntingdon where multiple people have been stabbed. “Officers are in attendance alongside @CambsCops and two people have been arrested.” The attack is understood to have started shortly after the LNER train left Peterborough station. In a statement on Facebook, Cambridgeshire Constabulary said: “We were called at 7.39pm with reports that multiple people had been stabbed on a train. “Armed officers attended and the train was stopped at Huntingdon, where two men were arrested. A number of people have been taken to hospital. “The incident remains ongoing and the A1307 has been closed as you approach the town centre.” Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened” to hear of the stabbings and added: “I urge people to avoid comment and speculation at this early stage.” Huntingdon Station is closed, National Rail said, with all lines blocked. London North Eastern Railway (LNER), which operates East Coast Mainline services in the UK, confirmed the incident had happened on one of its trains and has urged passengers not to travel because of “major disruption”.

He is also a co-founder and a commissioning editor at Hypatia Press, a publisher that specializes in philosophical works that challenge religion or spirituality. Donald Trump on Saturday threatened military action on foreign soil, escalating previous remarks about the nation. The president previously raised the possibility of sanctions against Nigeria for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians in what Trump now calls a ""disgraced country."" Nigerian officials have forcefully denied all the allegations. Trump went even further over the weekend, specifically threatening to use a military solution to what he considers to be a problem with persecution. ""If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing,' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,"" Trump said on Truth Social Saturday.

Youth Growth and Empowerment,"In this great walk of life, the things that the youth of the nation need to know are in dire need of their grooming and learning in the digital era. Well-groomed young minds equipped with training represent one of the most prominent and powerful assets for any nation. Across the world, there are more than 1.2 billion youth aged 15 to 24. In our beloved country, there is more than 60% of the population under the age of 30, which makes Pakistan the youngest nation in South Asia. Strong, academically and skilful youth of any nation potentially drive the economic growth, innovation, and social transformation. If the young minds are equipped with quality education, skill sets, mental well-being, and have the aptitudes towards social welfare services and the well-being of the people, then the nations can be proud of such individuals. The youth having such traits are capable of leading Pakistan in the true spirit. Their potential, innovation and creativity, patriotism, and resilience approach are the signs of hope. The key areas of learning for the young minds are as follows: Contemplation and pondering: In this technological era, the young minds need to know that they have only one chance at this thing called life. Gratitude in life is the most important thing to focus on what they have and not what they lack. The successful people in this world are not much smarter than the youth of this current era; whatever the great people have built, they have built dreams that changed the world. The difference was not brilliance and luck; it was just courage, bravery, and the initiatives they have taken. The comfort of their life might feel safe, but this would never lead them where they were meant to go. Sometimes, you have to lose the map and find yourself Nurturing the Young Minds: Nurturing the youth in terms of academic, social, and spiritual levels is the need of the present era that leads them towards empowerment, confidence, and motivates them to thrive in an evolving technological world. The youth of the great nation must be spiritually grounded, morally upright, and intellectually curious, guided by a strong sense of purpose. The young minds of the nation must be equipped with digital skills, innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship. Belief in Yourself: Youth must believe in their abilities and the unfolding vision. Sometimes, you have to lose the map and find yourself. The belief that no one has a vision like yours would be your superpower. You must fall in love with the process you are going through -the messy, uncertain, unglamorous middle. No one is clapping, except for you, who believes the great story still matters. Constant Struggle: Growth and empowerment a constant struggle and process that requires high willpower, commitment, dedication, and commitment by the youth. In addition, there is a need to focus on spiritual, academic, mental well-being, and social growth. Self-actualisation: The youth of Pakistan must realise that they are not the leader of tomorrow; they have the potential and strength of today. They have to build their dreams brick by fragile brick, even when they are facing frightful obstacles in their way. They have to be courageous and understand that the applause fades, but meaning lasts. They have to walk away from the places, people, and even versions of themselves that no longer fit. Sound Character: The young minds believe in their power and ability to shape the world. They must learn something and invest in their character, because true success and grace do not lie in talent, but in integrity, honesty, discipline, moral strength, and consistency. They must serve with compassion, which is the highest form of leadership to serve others. Big Dreams: Young minds must have big dreams and high willpower to achieve great success. They must realise that they are brave enough to dream big and achieve big. In addition, they must rise with unity, as it is said; united we rise, divided we fall. They must give the values to the unity instead of their belief, background, and identity; they can overcome any frightful obstacles and challenges in achieving their dreams. Responsibilities of Top Stakeholders: The top stakeholders of the country must unlock the potential of the young minds. They must consider them the true assets of the beloved country. The youth can be emerging as leaders, innovators, and change makers who are truly proud of their land, heritage, confident in their abilities, and rooted in values of compassion and empathy. Moon and Eagle: May the youth of our beloved country always shine brightly like a moon, and fly high like an eagle, as this bird has great traits and lives mostly in the air, stay at the peak of the mountains, and remain always in struggle and high grace. The great poet of the subcontinent, Allama Iqbal, used the word Shaheen symbolically for this king of the bird. May the young minds grow well, rock well, shine, and live with high grace.

Lincoln's Raley Cochran finishes as state runner up,"Raley Cochran maintains her pace. Ona, W.Va. — A year after Lincoln’s Raley Cochran finished 11th at the state meet, it was her goal to finish even higher. Her strategy was simple. “My strategy was to not let anybody get too far away from me and kick it in at the end, see who I could get,” Cochran said. And she accomplished that, as she was the Class AA state runner-up (20:21.39) at the 2025 WVSACC State Cross Country Championships on Saturday at Cabell Midland. “It feels pretty great,” Cochran said. “I’ve been working at this a long time, so I just feel great. It’s great to finish that high.” Cochran was the leader after the first mile, and although she entered the Cabell Midland High School track — the final stretch of the race — in fourth place, she passed two more runners to place second. “To know Raley basically since she was born and how hard she works at everything, she has certainly put the work in, so as a sophomore to be the state runner up is quite an accomplishment for her and certainly says a lot to her work ethic and her family who supported her and her team who has supported her,” Lincoln coach Kevin Nuzum said. “We’re real proud of Raley and all of the girls, the whole team, today.” She was joined in the top 10 by one of her teammates, Adalynn Milnes, a freshman, who placed seventh in 21:06.53, a second or two away from her personal-best time. She’s the lone freshman on the girls team, and her top-10 finish is the first from a freshman in school history at the state meet. “It was very exciting,” Milnes said. “I was excited to make it there because there’s no other freshmen on the team, and I’m the No. 2 runner.” Cochran and Milnes and others helped the Lincoln girls cross country team finish third. They had the same score (71) as Braxton County, but the tie breaker went to the Eagles since their final runner finished higher than Lincoln’s. Buffalo placed fourth (84) and Williamstown placed fifth (114). Also placing in the top 20 and earning a medal was Doddridge County’s Kaitlyn Key, who placed 11th (21:41.84). A senior, it wasn’t her personal-best time overall, but it was her best time on this course. “I wanted to start off strong,” Key said. “I feel like I do best when I get out ahead and get out of the park. Once I got down the hill, I had a little less than a mile and I just gave it everything I got, started to kick off girls one by one.” Key was one of two Doddridge County girls who qualified for the state meet, as Emily Cottrill also medaled with her 20th-place finish (22:42.39). Also, Philip Barbour’s Kayla Baker, in her final high school cross country race, placed 15th (22:22.920, South Harrison’s Savannah Holden finished 22nd (22:53.04) and Zoe Kirksey finished 48th (25:00.81). Boys The Doddridge County boys cross country team won the Class AA championship as a team as they placed first with an overall team score of 60. Lincoln was the state runner-up with an overall score of 71. The rest of the top five included Frankfort (90), Tyler Consolidated (fourth, 123) and Williamstown (fifth, 131). “It’s nice, it’s nice,” Doddridge County coach Josh Weekley said. “We had one on the girls side that we should’ve gotten a couple of years ago and didn’t, so getting this one on the boys, we knew coming in that we should, but you always have to do it on the course and they did exactly like they’ve done all year long. They all placed right around where we thought they should, a couple of them even elevated. They did what they needed to do, they went out and performed.” Amos Kimble of Tyler Consolidated won the Class AA boys state championship in 16:32.76. The state runner-up was Frankfort’s Gavin McDonald (16:51.52), and his teammate, Eric Alexander, placed third (17:11.30). Tyler Consolidated’s Tyler Moore placed fifth. Carter Sias was the Bulldogs’ top finisher on the boys side as he placed fourth in 17:19.90. It tied his best finish from his freshman year when he also placed fourth. “I’m very happy with that,” Sias said. “It definitely brings a lot of joy that I was able to do that my senior year. I think I’m more focused on seeing if the team gets a title, because I love my team a lot and I would love a title with them. I think that’s what I’m paying attention to more with them.” Sias also finished ahead of another local runner who had placed often beaten throughout the season, most often by 15 or more seconds. “I had him (Sias) down for fifth, I figured that was probably where he’d end up because Travis Moore from Tyler Consolidated had beaten him (by) 15-20 seconds all year long,” Weekley said. “Boy, he really stepped up and ran a good one. He was in third there for a while, but held on to the fourth spot. It’s big, he was five spots ahead of Lincoln’s No. 1 guy. Samuel (Gola) was five spots ahead of Lincoln’s No. 2 guy, that’s 10 points right there. The best I can tell, we won by 11, 10 of it is right there on those front two guys, so that’s a great race by Samuel to race seventh, get on the podium.” Nearly all of the Bulldogs medaled, as Samuel Gola placed seventh (17:54.73), Cory Swentzel placed 14th (18:17.37), Colton Key placed 17th (18:23.63) and Noah Bodkin finished 18th (18:27.74). Last year, Gola placed in the low 30s as a freshman and 17th as a sophomore, and while Saturday’s race wasn’t his personal-best time overall, it was his personal-best time on the state course and finish at the state event. “It felt great to finally get in the top 10,” Gola said. “I’ve never been so happy. I’ve worked so hard for it, and I’m really happy that I was finally able to get it.” Also finishing for the Bulldogs was Jacob Berke (50th, 20:06.68) and Cayleb Amos (51st, 20:09.10). For Lincoln, Adrian Bott placed ninth (18:05.56) in the final race of his high school career, all despite slipping a little bit out of the gates. It was an improvement over his 21st-place finish last year, and he is the first Lincoln boy to earn first-team all-state honors at the state meet. ”It felt good,” Bott said. “I definitely wanted to go faster, get a better place, but I didn’t start good enough.” Lincoln had four runners earn a medal. Aiden Byers placed 12th (18:16.51), Max Myers placed 13th (18:16.59) and Carter Knight placed 15th (18:21.38). “I’m just real proud of our team,” Nuzum said. “I thought did great. For a program that we’ve been building that I’ve coached for 16 years, to make it to states for both teams, and to do as well as we did, everyone wants to win, but I’ll take state runner-up. And with these young girls being third, they’re going to get there, so I’m real proud of this team. We’ve stayed healthy, we’ve stayed focused, we’ve stayed together, and I’m real proud of them.” Others who ran for the Cougars on Saturday include Seth Nay (24th, 18:53.34), Jonathon Folmsbee (25th, 18:54.35) and Dennis Napper (68th, 20:48.73). In a year where it was Lincoln’s first year for both teams to qualify for the state meet, having the whole teams at the event made it even better, Myers said. “It was the best experience of my life,” Myers said. “I love my entire team. We have four or five Liberty transfers, and we came together like family all year long with one goal of getting to states and doing the best we can.” Also, Philip Barbour’s Jacob Burner placed 19th (18:33.53), South Harrison’s Brennen Myers finished 32nd (19:20.06) and Nathaniel Linger placed 46th (20:01.33).

Scotland thrashes 85-0,"Darcy Graham and Duhan van der Merwe continued their personal battle to top Scotland's try-scoring charts as they ran in several scores during an 85-0, 13-try, rout of the United States at Murrayfield on Saturday. Scotland were without several first-choice players for their Autumn Nations Series opener, including Sione Tuipulotu, Finn Russell, Blair Kinghorn, Zander Fagerson, and Pierre Schoeman. But they were still far too strong for the United States, a tier two rugby union nation, ahead of next week's far sterner challenge at home to New Zealand, with Scotland yet to beat the All Blacks in 32 matches spanning 117 years of Tests between the two countries. ""Straight away, the players were very cohesive which is hard to achieve in a week's training, with a brand new team."" Scotland coach Gregor Townsend told the BBC. Looking ahead to the clash with New Zealand, the former Scotland playmaker added: ""It's a huge match. This game has been sold out for a while. Everyone loves watching the All Blacks. ""We've had two cracking matches against them (22-17 and 31-23 home defeats in 2017 and 2022) but not delivered that winning performance. ""There's no reason why we can't (beat New Zealand). The guys will be up for it and have the belief they can do it."" South Africa-born Van der Merwe marked his 50th cap with a double to take his Scotland tally to 34 tries, but fellow Edinburgh wing Graham moved level with him as the Dark Blues' highest try-scorer of all time with a hat-trick. The writing was on the wall for the Eagles as early as the fifth minute when Dylan Richardson went over from close range. And two minutes later, 21-year-old debutant back-row Liam McConnell's run up the left was followed by a basketball pass to set up Van der Merwe. Graham scored Scotland's third try before Van der Merwe grabbed his second of the match, with Scotland 45-0 ahead at half-time in an utterly lopsided contest. The rout continued after the break, with Graham completing his hat-trick four minutes into the second half after an exchange of passes with Ollie Smith.

Staff and parents voice concerns over proposed Anchorage school closures,"Nov. 1—The Anchorage School District this week heard criticism from parents and staff from two elementary schools it proposes to close next school year. Many questioned whether closing schools would increase class sizes, and took issue with the repeated disruption of programs for special education students. Anchorage School Board members are weeks away from voting on the proposed closures, but say they still want feedback from the community. A survey is available on the district website, and another ""community conversation"" is planned for Saturday at the district office building from noon to 2 p.m. If school board members vote to approve the plan, charter schools would move into the vacated Fire Lake and Lake Otis elementary buildings. The board will discuss the school closures proposed by district administrators for the first time Tuesday, and take a final vote on Nov. 18. One board member, Pat Higgins, attended two district events this week to hear from parents and staff and said he doesn't support the current plan, though he said he did support district efforts to add child care to vacant classrooms. ""They feel strongly that it's going to hurt the kids, and it's not good for the community, and they oppose it. That's what I heard,"" Higgins said. ""I'm not a big supporter of closing these schools. I don't think the benefits outweigh the adverse impact it has on the community and the involvement with the family."" District officials have argued that fewer school buildings are needed to serve a dwindling population of students. Compared to 2010, nearly 7,500 fewer students now attend neighborhood schools in the district. During that same time, the district has closed five schools. Deputy Chief of Schools Kersten Johnson-Struempler said underutilized schools are more susceptible to issues when one teacher has to call out sick, and closing schools will reduce the number of mixed-grade classrooms throughout the district. She told Lake Otis families who filed into the Bettye Davis East cafeteria on Wednesday that the plan attempts to use resources more efficiently by concentrating them at a smaller number of school buildings. [Alaska educators call for more school funding in second task force meeting] ""We are looking at low utilization rates. The reason we're here, unfortunately, is partially budget-related, but partially enrollment decline,"" Johnson-Struempler said. ""We as a district really do have to consider what is our utilization rate, how are we using our money as a district most effectively, and so that's a factor."" Special education concerns Lake Otis Elementary staff and parents questioned the district's plan to relocate students in special education classes. The distribution of Lake Otis students to other schools will also have a ripple effect on those programs. To make room for general education students moving from Lake Otis to Kasuun Elementary, students in the School Based Behavioral Supports program at Kasuun would relocate to Ocean View Elementary under the current plan. Kasuun special education behavior coach Chandra Binion is concerned that the sensory deprivation room at Kasuun may not be available for students who need it if they relocate to Ocean View. ""We have some students who came to us from Lake Hood after it closed. If we are moved to Ocean View, this will be their third location in three years. Our kids in our program thrive on consistency, stability, and that's what they need and this move feels like it's taking that away from them,"" Binion said. ""We deal with students who are often in crisis, and you can't keep moving them around like that if we want them to be successful."" During Johnson-Struempler's presentation detailing where special education students would be moved, she also noted the importance of routine for special education students. ""We do want to really pay attention for all students to the number of transitions they have, but particularly for our special education students in special programs,"" she said. ""Having consistency and limiting the transitions is something we really look at."" Jacqui Higgins, who chairs the district's Special Education Advisory Committee, said her child has made significant progress with their Life Skills teacher at Lake Otis. ""We spent a long time building this community, and I think it is unacceptable that the Anchorage School District thinks that it is OK to be so transient with their special education students,"" Higgins said. Higgins is worried that her child might regress next school year without familiar teachers. Higgins is also concerned about the impacts on her child of a longer bus ride with more students. Despite her reservations, she doesn't oppose the district's right-sizing effort altogether. ""I'm OK with right-sizing. We are losing people, our infrastructure is not built the way it used to be,"" Higgins said. At a school board meeting last week, Fire Lake parents also voiced concerns about special education programs. Special education students in the school's resource and structured learning classroom programs would relocate to Birchwood ABC school. Students in the Life Skills program at Birchwood would move to Alpenglow Elementary. ""There's a true family built around that entire SPED program. Those children belong in a way that I can't imagine replicated in another facility,"" parent Arielle Van Vleet said. Binion, the Kasuun special education teacher, said she hadn't heard satisfactory answers about her concerns after speaking with several board members and district staff Wednesday. ""It's all kind of on how the board votes. We're very, very concerned,"" Binion said. More feedback In addition to the meeting Wednesday, board member Kelly Lessens said she attended meetings this week with Indigenous, multicultural and special education advisory committees, as well as some middle school parents. Lessens heard several parents asking if school closures would increase class sizes at the schools receiving those students. Lessens said that's a misconception. ""It's not correct for people to say that school consolidations are going to increase their class sizes,"" Lessens said. ""What is true is that insufficient funds for supporting and maintaining public education are responsible for increased class sizes."" For Fire Lake, one topic that parents also bring up is a nearby housing development currently under construction, which will add more than 100 homes to the neighborhood. District officials have said the development is not likely to significantly affect the projected enrollment. Fire Lake was initially included in the list of schools planned for closure last year, but board members voted to remove it from consideration. ""We went through this last year, and every reason remains the same for why Fire Lake should remain open, and I cannot for the life of me understand how we're back here when nothing has changed. The only thing that has changed is that the development being built is further along than it was a year ago,"" Fire Lake parent Van Vleet said. Board members encouraged residents to continue voicing their concerns to the district. Families and other community members can take the district survey or testify at board meetings on Nov. 4 and Nov. 18. Board member Andy Holleman said he's typically accustomed to hearing complaints from parents when the district asks for feedback, but this week was different. ""When you go to these, people stand up and talk about how wonderful this school is and how it's the only place that really gets their kid, and they're not going to be able to do as well anywhere else,"" Holleman said, ""which is how we want everybody to feel about their schools. But at the same time, we just have too many buildings for the number of kids we're serving and this is going to be a tough choice.""",2025-11-01 22:11:00,Yahoo!

"Hamlin snatches Phoenix pole with Byron, Larson hot on his heels","James Gilbert/Getty Images ShareThis is disabled until you accept Social Networking cookies. Denny Hamlin will begin his NASCAR Cup Series championship quest from the pole Sunday afternoon at Phoenix Raceway. Hamlin topped the board in the final qualifying session of the 2025 season with a lap of 133.759mph (26.914s) – his fifth pole of the year and fourth at Phoenix. “We’re trying; we’re doing everything we can,” he said of winning the championship. “I’m really proud of this whole Progressive Toyota team. We’ve worked hard on it. We’ve really been working hard, and hopefully we get the payoff tomorrow.” William Byron and Kyle Larson, two of the three other Cup Series title contenders, qualified second and third. Byron clocked in at 133.551mph; Larson’s fast lap was 133.437mph.

Chase Briscoe, the fourth championship contender, qualified 12th (132.680mph). All four teams in the title hunt will have the pick of pit stall selections before the rest of the field. It will follow the order of qualifying, with Hamlin’s team picking their stall first, followed by Byron, Larson and Briscoe. “We’re obviously going to be in a great starting spot there at this point,” Hamlin said. “Then we have to make sure we do all the right things, and that’s execute the entire day. Largely, that’s going to rest on my shoulders, so I’ll do the best I can.” AJ Allmendinger was the only driver who did not post a qualifying time.

"Two arrested after multiple people stabbed on UK train, police say","Police operate near the scene after a series of stabbings on a train near Cambridge, Britain, November 1, 2025, in this screengrab from video obtained from social media. JAMIE SHAND/via REUTERS LONDON (Reuters) -Nine people were treated for life-threatening injuries after a series of stabbings on a train near Cambridge in eastern England on Saturday, and two men were arrested in what Prime Minister Keir Starmer called an ""appalling incident."" British Transport Police said counterterrorism police were supporting its investigation whilst it works to establish the full circumstances and motivation for the incident. “We’re conducting urgent enquiries to establish what has happened, and it could take some time before we are in a position to confirm anything further,"" British Transport Police Chief Superintendent Chris Casey said. ""At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident."" Cambridgeshire police said they were called at 1939 GMT after reports that multiple people had been stabbed on the 1825 service from Doncaster in northern England to London King's Cross. The train stopped at Huntingdon, with armed officers seen entering the train in videos on social media. ""Armed officers attended and the train was stopped at Huntingdon, where two men were arrested,"" the police said. One eyewitness told Sky News that one of the suspects, waving a large knife, was tasered by police. The East of England Ambulance Service said it mobilised a large-scale response to Huntingdon Railway Station, which included numerous ambulances and critical care teams, including three air ambulances. Starmer posted on X that the incident was ""deeply concerning."" ""My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response,"" he said.

Ireland crumble after the break as ruthless All Blacks turn the screw,"This time, Chicago was not Ireland’s kind of town. Unlike 2016, when they made history and transformed this fixture from a one-sided slaughter into a genuine rivalry, Ireland didn’t get things their own way. They had their moments, for sure. In fact, they even survived 20 minutes with a numerical disadvantage in the first half, holding the lead up until the hour mark. And then came that familiar meltdown which had characterised the first 111 years of this fixture. As New Zealand clicked up through the gears, Ireland went into reverse. First came a try from Tamaiti Williams on 61 minutes — New Zealand opting for a tap and go when a more conservative team might have kicked for the posts. That edged them a point in front. But they were only getting started. Next, on 67 minutes, came Wallace Sititi’s score — a superb flowing move from New Zealand’s perspective, a defensive disaster from Ireland’s. Garry Ringrose was exposed, Beauden Barrett and Damian McKenzie were brilliant, and Sititi finished off the move to make it 21–13 to New Zealand. And then, three minutes from the end, scrum-half Cam Roigard slalomed his way through a forest of Irish defenders to put the game beyond reach. Who would have thought that possible at half-time? Because at that stage, Ireland were ahead. Given they had played much of the first half with just 14 players, it was a superb opening 40 minutes. There were flaws — Jack Crowley overhitting several kicks, Dan Sheehan miscuing a few throws — but few teams ever dictate terms against New Zealand. Ireland did in that first period. For starters, there was a seventh-minute penalty from Crowley to make it 3–0. Ten minutes later came an inspired call by captain Dan Sheehan to go for the corner rather than the posts. Fortune favoured the brave. Sheehan, Ryan Baird, Sheehan again, then Jamison Gibson-Park and Stuart McCloskey combined to set up Tadhg Furlong, who barged across from close range. Try, Ireland. Crowley converted, and the lead stretched to 10–0. It didn’t last long. Will Jordan reminded everyone why “Jordan” is a name that resonates in Chicago. The New Zealand full-back swept through the Irish midfield on 19 minutes, and by the time the cover defence scrambled back, the ball was zipped right for Ardie Savea to touch down. Beauden Barrett converted. 10–7. It stayed that way until half-time. With James Ryan off for a HIA and Tadhg Beirne gone for the rest of the game, Ireland had neither of their starting locks on the field by the break. You could say they were stuck between a lock and a hard place. And yet, they still led. Pre-match, the PA man had played a Phil Collins song to gee everyone up. Then, against all odds, Ireland led New Zealand at the break. But after losing here in 2016, all New Zealand wanted was one more night in Soldier Field. They got it here — and they got a performance, too. By the second half, their scrum had solidified, their aerial game steadied, and their handling sharpened. Those three second-half tries owed everything to their ability to execute when it mattered. Few teams in the world can do that. Ireland, in 2022 and 2023, were one of those teams at that level. Now, they are not. This was proof — a team in transition, still missing Johnny Sexton, with neither Crowley nor Sam Prendergast quite there yet. In the end, they ran out of steam. Those 20 minutes without Tadhg Beirne, sent off for a high tackle on Beauden Barrett, proved crucial. Playing New Zealand is tough enough when it’s 15 versus 15. Make it 15 versus 14, even for 20 minutes, and you will suffer. It took a while for that disadvantage to catch up with Ireland. But it did. The All Blacks played like all backs — their handling slick, Ireland’s less so. Chicago belongs to them this time.",2025-11-01 22:31:00,Irish Mirror,negative,0.4724,53,Give_Tiernan_Really," Tadhg Furlong, Tamaiti Williams and Wallace Sititi scored tries for New Zealand .

"Liverpool beat Villa to end Premier League losing streak, Man Utd draw","Mohamed Salah and Ryan Gravenberch net as holders Liverpool beat Villa to end their four-game Premier League losing run. Published On 1 Nov 20251 Nov 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Liverpool finally halted their dreadful losing run with a 2-0 Premier League victory over Aston Villa on Saturday to climb into third place in the table, as Mohamed Salah became the third player in Reds history to score 250 goals. Under mounting pressure after four successive league losses – and six in their last seven games across all competitions – Arne Slot’s men climbed to within seven points of league leaders Arsenal, with 18 points. Villa fell to 11th in the table on 15 points. list of 4 itemsend of list Salah struck in first-half injury time, capitalising on a huge blunder from Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who played the ball right into the path of Liverpool’s talisman. Salah finished first time to the relief of the anxious Anfield crowd, and joined Roger Hunt and Ian Rush as the only players to score 250 goals for the Merseyside club. Ryan Gravenberch doubled the home side’s lead in the 58th minute when he blasted a shot from the top of the box that deflected off Pau Torres and in, past Martinez. A stunning volley from Amad Diallo earned Manchester United a battling 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Saturday. Looking to continue their revival under Ruben Amorim, United appeared to be on their way to securing a fourth successive league victory after Brazilian veteran Casemiro headed them into a 34th-minute lead. United, however, capitulated early in the second half, when two goals in less than two minutes from Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona helped Forest to turn the match on its head. The visitors responded well, but were frustrated in their efforts to restore parity until Diallo unleashed a blistering strike from the edge of the penalty area nine minutes from time to secure a point for Amorim’s side. Diallo almost snatched victory at the death, as United missed the chance to climb up to second in the standings with a win, the point helping them to move into fifth in the standings, above rivals Manchester City, who play on Sunday.

"NYT Pips Hints, Walkthrough And Solutions For Sunday, November 2","ByErik Kain, Senior Contributor. If you’re looking for help with today’s NYT Pips puzzle, look no further! Below, you’ll find the solutions for the Easy and Medium-tier Pips and a full walkthrough for the Hard Pips. It’s another beautiful day in November, so be sure to get out there and enjoy it before chillier weather descends. Winter is coming. Let’s solve this Pips! Looking for Friday’s Pips? Read our guide right here. In Pips, you have a grid of multicolored boxes. Each colored area represents a different “condition” that you have to achieve. You have a select number of dominoes that you have to spend filling in the grid. You must use every domino and achieve every condition properly to win. There are Easy, Medium and Difficult tiers. Here’s an example of a difficult tier Pips: As you can see, the grid has a bunch of symbols and numbers with each color. On the far left, the three purple squares must not equal one another (hence the equal sign crossed out). The two pink squares next to that must equal a total of 0. The zig-zagging blue squares all must equal one another. You click on dominoes to rotate them, and will need to since they have to be rotated to fit where they belong. Not shown on this grid are other conditions, such as “less than” or “greater than.” If there are multiple tiles with > or 4 into Green 12 and the 6/0 domino from Green 12 into Pink 0. Next, I placed the 0/5 domino from Pink 0 into Orange 10. I finished up the Pink 0 group with the 0/1 domino into Blue = and placed it horizontally, since you can tell you need to leave the space above empty. Next, I placed the 0/3 domino from Purple 0 into Dark Blue 6 and the 3/1 domino from Dark Blue 6 into the big Blue = group. Then I placed the 5/1 domino from Orange 10 up into Blue = and the 1/1 domino in the center of the Blue = group. Time for the remaining limbs. I placed the 6/4 domino from Blue > 4 into Purple 8 and the 4/2 domino from Purple 8 into the Dark Blue 2 tile. Then I placed the 3/2 domino from Orange 3 into Green 8 and the 6/1 tile from Green 8 into the Blue = group. With just the little man’s head remaining, I placed the 1/4 domino from Blue = into Pink 8 and the 0/4 domino from the Purple 0 tile into Pink 8. Now the happy dancing man is complete! This Pips was a lot more daunting than it was challenging. Lots of small total groups that could be solved different ways, but pretty obvious clues on where to go right off the bat. Starting where I did helped, I think, because it was pretty clear that the 6/0 would go into Pink 0 and the rest of that group led me straight to where I needed to go next. Still fun, just not nearly as hard as yesterday’s. Let me know if you solved this a different way on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook.

"Candidate in Columbus, Ohio, Declares, ' We Believe in Somalia' at Campaign Rally","As our own Doug Powers reported a couple of days ago, Omar Fateh, the mayoral candidate known as the ""Mamdani of Minneapolis,"" pledged his loyalty to the country … of Somalia. Fateh waved the Somali flag at a campaign rally and pledged loyalty to the country, despite the fact that he was born in Washington, D.C. Omar Fateh waves foreign flag, speaks a foreign language, pledges his loyalty to Somalia, tells Somalians to elect himThis is a rally in Minneapolis pic.twitter.com/uVP4k8TVcK It was a nice concession of Fateh to have an American flag behind him. We know that Minneapolis is Little Somalia, but it looks like Columbus, Ohio, is moving in the same direction. We're not sure why this woman is urging children who are too young to vote to get out and vote, but she assures them, ""We believe in Somalia."" The Associated Press just a couple of weeks ago published a feature about Somali Americans running for office. ""It’s a busy Friday afternoon at a Somali restaurant on the northeast side of Columbus, home to the second-largest Somali population in the United States. The smell of spices is just as robust as the loud conversation, and the East African restaurant is crowded after afternoon prayers at the nearby mosque."" ""WE BELIEVE IN SOMALIA"" This is a rally for a candidate in… Columbus, Ohio pic.twitter.com/nrninMBeSh The two little girls up front are even dressed as the Somali flag. “We believe in Somalia”.Awesome, then go back there and make your own country better. Invasions by invitation are a real issue I believe in Somalia so much I want it to have its missing Somalians back. I believe in sending them back there Then return to Somalia. Take Ilhan Omar with you. They do know where they are.. right? I believe in Somalians going back to Somalia Upon taking office, you have to swear that you hold no allegiance or loyalty to any other country but the United States.Which means this kind of rhetoric disqualifies them by default. Thought that was the Minnesota flag for a second It was just a couple of years ago that Minnesota changed its ""offensive"" state flag to one that looks a lot like the Somali flag. Coming soon to a town/city near you Matt Walsh posted a hard truth on Friday: We should have never allowed immigration from Somalia at all. It has not benefited this country in the slightest way. Now they are taking over once-proud American cities, and will turn them into the same kind of failed dysfunctional hellscape that they fled. Like they say, import the third world, become the third world. *** Editor’s Note: The Schumer Shutdown is here.

Disney Channels Vanish From YouTube TV After Contract Dispute,"YouTube TV subscribers — including thousands across North Texas — lost access to ESPN, ABC, National Geographic, and over a dozen other Disney-owned channels after the companies failed to reach a new distribution deal. The blackout, which began late Thursday, affects major sports coverage, including college football games on Saturday and upcoming NBA, NFL, and NHL contests. YouTube TV, the largest U.S. internet TV provider with more than 9 million subscribers, warned viewers of the dispute for weeks through on-screen messages. YouTube TV’s parent company, Google, said Disney demanded higher fees that would drive up prices for subscribers. In a blog post updated just before midnight, YouTube accused Disney of yanking its channels to steer viewers toward its own streaming services, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo. “We know this is a frustrating and disappointing outcome for our subscribers and we continue to urge Disney to work with us constructively to reach a fair agreement that restores their networks to YouTube TV,” the company said, the Associated Press reported. YouTube TV said it will credit subscribers $20 if Disney content stays dark for an extended period. The service’s base plan costs $82.99 per month. Disney countered that YouTube TV refused to “pay fair rates” and accused the company of “using its market dominance to eliminate competition,” according to Axios. “With a $3 trillion market cap, Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we’ve successfully negotiated with every other distributor,” Disney said in a statement, AP reported. Disney emphasized that major college football matchups — including several Top 25 teams — will be affected this weekend, adding that it hopes to reach a resolution quickly. The dispute marks the fourth major content standoff for YouTube TV since August. The service has faced similar threats from Fox Corp. and NBCUniversal and remains at an impasse with TelevisaUnivision. One reported sticking point involves whether Disney would allow YouTube TV to distribute its streaming content within the platform — a concession Disney has little incentive to grant as it builds its own services. YouTube is also considering a separate sports and broadcast package. Unlike traditional cable providers, virtual pay-TV services face fewer regulations — giving YouTube TV flexibility to push for cheaper, more modern streaming deals.",2025-11-01 22:30:50,Yahoo!

Roast potatoes will be crispy every time when you add 1 thing at boiling stage,"Roast potatoes are a quintessential part of a traditional roast dinner. We Brits are mad about roast potatoes, and there's always a bit of a debate over the best recipe to get that perfect crispy exterior while keeping the inside fluffy. You might have been taught that potatoes should only ever be cooked in a specific type of fat, or you may firmly believe the way they're moved from boiling to roasting is crucial. The reality is, there are countless ways to roast a potato, and if your preferred method results in tasty spuds, then you're not doing anything wrong. However, if you're on the hunt for a foolproof way to ensure crispy potatoes every time, one culinary enthusiast on social media may just have the ideal trick. All you need to do is add one ingredient to the water during the boiling process. In an Instagram video, Oryan Levi revealed her secret tip for perfect roast potatoes. She mentioned her mates often ask her for the recipe, and she gets her perfect crisp by adding a common kitchen cupboard item to her boiling water. Oryan began by saying she was using baby potatoes instead of larger ones, and she halved them but left the skins on. This trick could still work with regular potatoes typically used for roasting, but the secret ingredient is intended to crisp up the skins so it might not be as effective on peeled potatoes. She then put them all into a pot and added some water, along with the secret ingredient - baking soda. She advised: ""A tablespoon of baking soda in the water is going to help make the skin super crispy."" Oryan then proceeded with the usual cooking process, removing the potatoes from the water once they were ""fork tender"". After draining them in a colander, she emphasised the ""most important part of the process"" was letting them sit in the colander for at least 10 minutes to allow all the excess water to evaporate. Next, Oryan seasoned the potatoes with garlic, salt, pepper, and oil, before spreading them out on a baking tray. She then positioned each potato cut side down and baked them in the oven for 15-20 minutes at 220°C - resulting in perfectly cooked and crispy potatoes. In the caption of her post, she wrote: ""My biggest tip with this recipe is to get to know your oven well. Does it run hot? Are there hot spots where food tends to get extra crispy? There's a delicate balance between perfectly golden and too far gone. The first time you make this, keep a close eye and check on your taters often to make sure they don't burn!"" 1. Choose the right potato:Go for starchy potatoes like Russets or Maris Piper. They crisp up better than waxy varieties. 2. Cut evenly:Cut your potatoes into similar-sized chunks so they cook evenly. Larger chunks give a fluffy inside; smaller ones get crispier. 3. Parboil First:Boil the potatoes in salted water for 7-10 minutes until just tender (they should be soft on the outside but not falling apart). This helps create a fluffy exterior. 4. Rough them up:Drain the potatoes and give them a good shake in the colander or pan to rough up the edges. These rough bits become extra crispy. 5. Preheat the fat:While the potatoes are parboiling, preheat your roasting pan with oil or fat (vegetable oil, duck/goose fat, or beef dripping) in a hot oven (220°C/425°F). Adding potatoes to hot fat ensures instant sizzle and crispiness. 6. Don't crowd the pan:Spread the potatoes out in a single layer with space between them. Overcrowding steams them instead of roasting. 7. Season well:Toss with salt, pepper, and any desired herbs (rosemary, thyme, garlic cloves) before roasting. 8. Roast and turn:Roast for 40-50 minutes, turning once or twice for even browning. Don't turn too often - let them crisp up! 9. Finish with a sprinkle:For extra crunch, sprinkle with a little coarse salt or a dusting of semolina/flour before roasting. 10. Serve immediately:Crispy potatoes are best served right out of the oven!",2025-11-02 08:04:00,Wales Online,neutral,0.5941,44,More_Payouts_Top, Oryan Levi revealed her secret trick for perfect roast potatoes on Instagram .

Struggling With Dry Mouth? Here’s What Causes It Causes And Home Remedies To Relieve It Naturally,"Written by Muskan Gupta |Published : November 2, 2025 1:33 PM IST Dry mouth, also known as xerostomia, is more common than most people realise. It might be not only a slight pain in its essence but also indicate a health complication, say dentists. It occurs as a result of the inability of the salivary glands in your mouth to produce just enough saliva to keep your mouth moist. Salivation is important in the preservation of oral health, and the absence of salivation may cause a number of dental and health issues. Dry mouth refers to a condition that experiences an abnormally dry mouth because of lack of sufficient saliva. Saliva assists in cleaning the food particles as well as neutralising acids and bacteria. The mouth is susceptible to infections, cavities, and even bad breath when the level of saliva reduces. This condition is either a temporary one, as may happen upon intake of some drugs, or it may be chronic, as may be associated with health complications or interventions.

Dry mouth's common causes include: Dry mouth is hard to miss, in the event that you are aware of it. The common symptoms include: In case of these symptoms taking more than a few days, then it is worthy of visiting a dentist in order to have an evaluation. You may like to read There is always a shortage of saliva, which can cause severe problems with the mouth. Saliva plays key roles in the cleaning of food in the mouth and breaking down the acids that are produced by the bacteria. Lack of sufficient amounts of it leads to a higher rate of accumulated plaque that puts individuals at risk of tooth decay, gum disease and mouth infections. In extreme cases, it may also contribute to taste as well as render the use of dentures painful. See your dentist in case you always feel dry or you eat and speak with difficulty. Chronic dry mouth can be an indication of some underlying condition that requires medical intervention. One can avoid cavities by taking care of their mouth at an early age. TRENDING NOW Dry mouth might appear to be a minor takeaway, yet dentists say that this symptom should not be overlooked at all. The mouth requires a healthy flow of saliva; hence, one should listen to what the body is telling you.

IPL 2026 Trade Window: BIG TWIST Ahead of Auction! Sanju Samson and KL Rahul’s Trade Makes A Massive U-Turn – Know Full Details,"---Advertisement--- IPL 2026 Trade Window: The IPL 2026 trade window is already buzzing with speculation, and all eyes are on two of India’s top batsmen. Rumours are swirling that KL Rahul and Sanju Samson could be sporting new jerseys ahead of the upcoming season, potentially shaking up team dynamics across the league. Reports suggest that the Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals are close to finalizing a high-profile trade. If confirmed, Sanju Samson could move to Delhi in exchange for Tristan Stubbs. This swap would be among the biggest in recent IPL history, with Samson bringing leadership experience and consistent run-scoring to a Delhi lineup that is looking to strengthen its batting core. Delhi fans could see a significant boost if Samson dons their jersey in IPL 2026. 🚨 TRANSFER BOMBSHELL! 🚨Sanju Samson ➡️ Delhi Capitals on the cards ahead of IPL 2026 👀💥If this happens — it’s gonna shake the entire IPL trade window! 🔥#SanjuSamson #DelhiCapitals #IPL2026 #IPLRumours pic.twitter.com/C3BmBGXtEI Meanwhile, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are reportedly eyeing KL Rahul as they look to bounce back after a disappointing 2025 season. The Knight Riders are in need of a proven batter who can also take on leadership responsibilities. Rahul, who has captained Punjab and Lucknow, fits the bill perfectly. His strong relationship with KKR’s new coach, Abhishek Nayar, adds extra appeal for the franchise. However, KKR faces a tricky challenge. Building an attractive trade deal for Delhi won’t be easy. The Knight Riders are reluctant to part with key players like Rinku Singh or Angkrish Raghuvanshi, and veterans Andre Russell and Sunil Narine are untouchable. This limits their elite trade options, making the potential acquisition of Rahul a complex puzzle. 🚨 KKR WANTS KL RAHUL 🚨– KKR is desperate to have KL Rahul in their team but biggest question is that which player they will trade. [Sahil Malhotra from TOI] pic.twitter.com/8RoWLOgZOx Sources also indicate that KKR is preparing to make a big push for Cameron Green in the upcoming IPL auction. This suggests the franchise is planning a major rebuild around a fresh core of players. With both Rahul and Samson potentially on the move, the IPL 2026 trade window could dramatically alter team compositions, making the next season one of the most exciting yet. Fans can expect a period of intense speculation and high-stakes negotiations as franchises look to fine-tune their squads. The coming weeks could see some blockbuster deals that change the balance of power in the IPL.

Earlier on Day 3, India A finished at 119-4 in 39 overs, needing 156 runs to win with six wickets in hand. Pant and Badoni stitched a 53-run stand before the visitors dismissed the in-form wicketkeeper-batter. Pant looked set on the crease as he took his previous day’s score of 64 not out to enter the nervous nineties. However, Tiaan van Vuuren struck in the 49th over to dismiss Pant on 90, thereby reducing the hosts to 172/5 in their chase of 275 runs. Badoni and Kotian then carried the game forward, but the former was dismissed, scoring a 47-ball 34, as van Vuuren struck again in the 53rd over, putting an end to their 23-run sixth-wicket stand. While Kotian looked to settle in quickly, a poor choice of shot led to him being caught at fine leg as Lutho Sipamla provided his side with another breakthrough, bringing the Indian side down to 215/7 in 89 overs.

Central Catholic senior from Lowell named 2026 National Merit Scholarship Commended Student,"LAWRENCE — Central Catholic High School senior and Lowell resident Mason Crowley, Class of 2026, was recently named a semifinalist by the 2026 National Merit Scholarship Program. CCHS Principal Andrew Murray presented Mason with a letter of acknowledgement for his academic accomplishments. “The entire Central Catholic community is beyond proud of the academic success of Mason,” said Murray. “We are confident that he will move on to amazing accomplishments and make the CCHS legacy even stronger.” According to NMSC, about 16,000 entrants were named semifinalists — the highest-scoring entrants in each state. The students were notified through their schools and provided scholarship application materials explaining requirements to advance in the competition for National Merit Scholarships to be offered in 2027. In addition to academics, Mason — who wants to pursue a degree in engineering or computer science — participates in several activities including Track & Field, National Honor Society, Student Alumni Association, and Student Ambassador Association. Mason also makes time to serve others: “My favorite service event is the Student Alumni Association Christmas Wrapping event, because it’s a great opportunity for us as students to get together and to give to those in need. I have also helped with the TeamWalk for Cancer Care in Lowell, the Haverhill Golf Tournament, the Special Olympics Field Games, and mentoring at Saint Mary’s Church.” Mason believes all his CCHS teachers have been supportive, but he has specific faculty shout-outs including Sully Grella ’92 (math faculty/coach), Brian Griffin (science faculty), Eric Boucher ’04 (math faculty), Cameron Hebert ’17 (math faculty). “I feel that what makes Central Catholic so special is definitely the sense of community. Everyone makes such a sincere effort to welcome and understand each other, and it makes a huge difference,” said Mason.

AI song generator Udio offers brief window for downloads after Universal settlement upsets users,"Artificial intelligence song generation platform Udio said it would give its frustrated users 48 hours starting Monday to download their songs before the company shifts to a new business model to comply with a legal settlement. The short reprieve comes after Udio on Wednesday said it had settled copyright infringement claims brought by Universal Music, a label with artists including Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, Drake and Kendrick Lamar. AI companies are now fighting so many copyright lawsuits that a tech industry lobby group, the Chamber of Progress, last week called on President Donald Trump to sign an executive order directing federal attorneys ""to intervene in legal cases"" to defend the industry's practice of building generative AI tools by feeding them on copyrighted works. Citing more than 50 pending federal cases, the group asked for help stopping court fights leading to ""potentially company-killing penalties"" that threaten AI innovation. But artists have warned that AI tools built on their works also threaten their livelihoods. In the biggest settlement so far, AI company Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion — or $3,000 per book — to settle claims from authors who alleged the company illegally pirated nearly half a million of their works to train its chatbot. Udio and Universal didn't disclose the financial terms of their new music licensing agreements. They also said they will team up on a new streaming platform. As part of the agreement, Udio immediately stopped allowing people to download songs they've created, which sparked a backlash and apparent exodus among paying users. ""We know the pain it causes to you,"" Udio later said in a post on Reddit's Udio forum, where users were venting about feeling betrayed by the platform's surprise move and complained that it limited what they could do with their music. Udio said it still must stop downloads as it transitions to a new streaming platform next year. But over the weekend, it said it will give people 48 hours starting at 11 a.m. Eastern time Monday to keep their ""past creations."" ""Udio is a small company operating in an incredibly complex and evolving space, and we believe that partnering directly with artists and songwriters is the way forward,"" said Udio's post. The settlement deal was the music industry's first since Universal, along with Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Records, sued Udio and another AI song generator, Suno, last year over copyright infringement. Udio and Suno pioneered AI song generation technology, which can spit out new songs based on prompts typed into a chatbot-style text box. Users, who don't need musical talent, can merely request a tune in the style of, for example, classic rock, 1980s synth-pop or West Coast rap. Record labels have accused the platforms of exploiting the recorded works of artists without compensating them. In its lawsuit filed against Udio last year, Universal sought to show how specific AI-generated songs made on Udio closely resembled Universal-owned classics like Frank Sinatra's ""My Way,"" The Temptations' ""My Girl,"" ABBA's ""Dancing Queen"" and holiday favorites like ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" and ""Jingle Bell Rock."" A musician-led group, the Artist Rights Alliance, said Friday that the Universal-Udio settlement represents a positive step in creating a ""legitimate AI marketplace"" but raised questions about whether independent artists, session musicians and songwriters will be sufficiently protected from AI practices that present an ""existential threat"" to their careers. ""Licensing is the only version of AI's future that doesn't result in the mass destruction of art and culture,"" the group said. ""But this promise must be available to all music creators, not just to major corporate copyright holders.""",2025-11-02 20:08:00,Wmur,negative,0.5547,14,More_Real_Usc, AI song generation platform Udio says it will give users 48 hours to download songs they've created .

Chargers’ Joe Alt carted off field with ankle injury against Titans,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Jim Harbaugh didn't have an update on Los Angeles Chargers left tackle Joe Alt after he was carted off the field Sunday, and what the coach said wasn't promising. Alt hurt his right ankle in the second quarter against the Tennessee Titans, and a cart came out pretty quickly to take him off the field. Alt never returned as the Chargers beat the Titans 27-20. “Yeah, feel that,” Harbaugh said when asked about seeing Alt go down. “Feel for him, feel bad for him.” Alt missed three games with a sprained right ankle and returned Oct. 23 in the Chargers' win over Minnesota. He didn't get up after a long incompletion by Justin Herbert with 4:49 left in the first half against Tennessee. Jamaree Salyer replaced Alt on the next play, and the Chargers gave up their second sack on the next play after Alt was taken off the field. The Chargers already had right tackle Bobby Hart leave in the first quarter with a groin injury. Trey Pipkins III, who came in at right tackle, said it's never easy seeing someone go down. “It’s difficult, but I mean, that’s kind of the nature of the position, right?” Pipkins said. “I feel like the O-line room specifically have a lot of camaraderie. We got a lot of tradition and that’s our standard is that when people go down, people step up.” The Chargers (6-3) wound up giving up a season-high six sacks without their offensive tackles. Harbaugh said other players stepped up. “Sometimes you could say ... the team finds itself in a situation where it’s got its back against the wall,” Harbaugh said. “I mean, that’s when you find out who you really are. Felt that’s what our guys did today. Dug deep, gritty win, found a way to win.”",2025-11-02 20:07:56,Sportsnet,negative,0.555,0,Loss_After_Career," Left tackle Joe Alt hurt his right ankle in the second quarter against the Tennessee Titans .

Earthquake Today: Significant Casualties Expected As 6.3-Magnitude Quake Strikes Afghanistan,"Date The quake was detected near the city of Mazar-i-Sharif and the town of Khulm, and struck at a depth of 23 kilometres, as per the National Center for Seismology (NCS). Given the timing of the earthquake, which struck at at 1 am local time, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) warned that it could be deadly. ""Significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread. Past events with this alert level have required a regional or national level response,"" the USGS was quoted as saying by CNN. Afghanistan's national disaster management agency said assessments on casualties and damages would be shared later, reported Reuters. Afghanistan is no stranger to deadly earthquakes, having seen major ones in the recent past. Earlier in August this year, at least 2,200 people were killed and more than 2,800 others were injured after a 6.0-magnitude struck the mountainous stretch of provinces in the eastern region of Afghanistan. The quake on 31 August had struck Afghanistan's Kunar province at 11.47 pm local time. Two years back, in October 2023, Afghanistan also saw widespread devastation after four large earthquakes measuring 6.3 in magnitude, and their aftershocks, struck near the city of Herat. Over 1,000 people lost their lives in the 2023 quake and over 2,400 were reportedly injured. (This is a developing story. Check back for updates.)

Sabalenka serves her way past Paolini at WTA Finals; Gauff hits 17 double-faults in loss to Pegula,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka put on a dominant serving display in her opening match at the WTA finals, producing 10 aces in a 6-3, 6-1 win over No. 8-ranked Jasmine Paolini on Sunday. Sabalenka served four aces in the final game of the first set alone and overall put 82.7% of her first serves in play. The match, which was Sabalenka’s 500th at the WTA level, lasted 70 minutes. “I was focused, I was calm and it felt like everything was in control,” Sabalenka said. On Saturday, Sabalenka was presented with a trophy for finishing the year at No. 1. “I’m super happy and super proud of the work that has been done and that things are working and I’m getting better and better every day,” she said. “And I just hope that we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and hopefully we can stay there.” The season-ending tournament for the year’s top eight players starts with two four-woman groups of round-robin play. The top two finishers in each group advance to the semifinals. “I take this tournament as a regular tournament that I have to win five matches if I want to win the title,” Sabalenka said. “So I’m just trying to bring my best tennis and fight for every point.” In the same group, Jessica Pegula beat defending champion Coco Gauff 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-2 in an all-American matchup. Gauff again struggled with her serve, hitting 17 double-faults — including one to hand the first set to Pegula, her former doubles partner. Before she ultimately pulled it out in the tiebreaker, Gauff twice failed to serve out the second set. On her second such chance, she hit three consecutive double-faults to let Pegula break her again and force a tiebreaker. Three weeks ago, Gauff beat Pegula in the final of the Wuhan Open in China. “Obviously, little frustrated with the serve today,” Gauff said. “Overall, it was a tough match for me. Jess played well and I thought she was playing a bit smarter than she was when we played in Wuhan.” Added Pegula, “Coco is a great champion, great competitor, good friend. So it’s always tough playing her. I don’t think there’s any secrets with this group of girls here.” Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina won their opening matches on Saturday. Also Saturday, Paolini and partner Sara Errani won their opening doubles match. AP tennis: Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Could AI help treat people with prostate cancer? A groundbreaking study is set to find out,"A new study is set to investigate how AI could significantly improve doctors’ decisions regarding prostate cancer treatment. While diagnostic methods for the disease have become safer and more precise, medical professionals still face considerable challenges in accurately assessing its aggressiveness in individual patients. This difficulty can lead to some men undergoing invasive procedures such as surgery or radiotherapy, when a less aggressive monitoring approach might have been more appropriate. The crucial Vanguard Path study, spearheaded by researchers at the University of Oxford, is being funded with a £1.9m grant from the charity Prostate Cancer UK to address this vital issue. Experts will first test the technology – called ArteraAI Prostate Biopsy Assay – on prostate biopsy samples from men who have already been diagnosed and treated for the disease and have at least five years of follow-up data. The study will compare how well the predictions made by the AI tool match what happened to patients in the real world. It will then be tested in real clinics on biopsies from men as they are diagnosed, with a focus on cases in which doctors find it hard to decide the best course of treatment. The three NHS organisations taking part are North Bristol NHS Trust, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Professor Clare Verrill, lead researcher on the project, said the trial “will pave the way for advanced AI technologies” to be rolled out on the NHS. “This will enable more detailed and precise information to be provided to men who will be able to make better-informed decisions with their clinical team about whether they can be safely monitored or need treatment – and, if so, help guide those decisions,” she added. Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “AI has the potential to massively improve prostate cancer care and make sure that every man has the most accurate and best treatment plan for his specific cancer. “We’ve been working with Artera for several years now and I believe that their AI tool is one of the most exciting ones to have been developed. But exciting AI tools can only make a difference if they can be properly evaluated. “This new project from Professor Verrill and her team is so exciting, because it tests this new technology in real-world settings, meaning we can deliver the final evidence needed for it to be rolled out across the NHS.” Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males and about one in eight men will have it in their lifetime, according to Prostate Cancer UK. Some 58,218 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in England in 2024, up from 53,462 the year before, according to the National Prostate Cancer Audit (NPCA). Andre Esteva, chief executive and co-founder of Artera, said: “We developed the ArteraAI Prostate Biopsy Assay to help improve the lives of prostate cancer patients and have spent years gathering evidence about its potential impact. “We’re delighted to be working with Professor Verrill and her team to see how the test could be used to maximise benefit for men in the NHS and hope that we will soon see the tool being used to personalise prostate cancer care for men in the UK.” News of the study comes days after it emerged an NHS trial will use AI to interpret MRI scans from men suspected of having prostate cancer. If the software detects a scan it deems high risk for the disease, it will be sent to radiologists for priority review and the patient will be booked in for a same-day biopsy. Specialists can then review results and either rule out or diagnose prostate cancer faster. The pilot will run in 15 hospitals, NHS England said.

‘UK public have tougher stance on immigration and diversity than people in US’,"People in the UK are less likely than their US counterparts to feel diversity strengthens society and more likely to have tougher attitudes on immigration, according to research. The findings are said to show that a common narrative about Britain being more socially liberal than America does not ring true across all issues. The National Centre for Social Research also found Reform UK voters in Britain were more likely than supporters of President Donald Trump in the US to say immigrants living in their country without permission should not be allowed to stay. While seven in 10 supporters of Mr Trump felt this way, the figure was almost eight in 10 (79%) among Reform followers. The researchers said they wanted to “better understand how public attitudes in the UK compare with those in the US, and the extent of polarisation in the two countries”. Their survey found 42% of people in the UK think there should be legal efforts to deport immigrants living here without permission, compared with just a third (33%) in the US. While almost two-thirds (64%) of respondents in the US felt diversity strengthens society, only around half (49%) of the UK public agreed. Proportions were similar when it came to how open their country is to people from around the world, with 63% in the US feeling this is essential to national identity but only 49% of people in the UK feeling this way. Alex Scholes, research director at NatCen, said: “The idea that Britain is more socially liberal than America doesn’t hold up across all issues. “While the UK is clearly more liberal on questions to do with family, sexuality and religion, attitudes to immigration and diversity show the opposite pattern. “People in the UK are less likely than those in the US to see diversity as a strength, or to think that openness to people from other countries is essential to who we are as a nation. Our findings suggest that polarisation in the two countries looks very different. “In the UK, the sharpest divides are around immigration and national identity, in the US they’re around social issues and the role of government. These differences will shape political debate on both sides in the years to come.” When it comes to issues such as abortion, contraception and same-sex marriage, people in the UK were found to be more liberal in their attitudes. The vast majority (92%) of people in the UK said contraception being widely available is good for society, compared with 78% in the US, and while around six in 10 (59%) people in the UK think same-sex marriage being legal is good for society, only around a third (34%) said so in the US. While 86% of people in the UK think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, fewer than two thirds (63%) felt this way in the US. Reform UK voters had a more liberal view on abortion, with 82% thinking it should be legal in all or most cases, compared with 35% of supporters of Mr Trump. – More than 2,000 UK residents aged 16 and over were surveyed in June 2025, being asked the same questions as more than 8,000 people in the US aged 18 and over who were surveyed in April 2024.

Repairs start on church tower at risk of falling,"Work is to begin on a Grade II listed church tower that has been deemed at risk of falling on to surrounding town centre pavements. St Lawrence Church, on Dial Lane in Ipswich, is currently used as a community cafe and it will have its flint and stone work restored after plans were approved in November 2024. It came after inspections by Ipswich Borough Council in December 2023 found certain parts of the tower were bulging and at risk of falling. The proposed works will ensure the decommissioned church is preserved and continues to operate as a community hub and cafe. Protective scaffolding was put in place to ensure the safety of the public until repair work started. The medieval church, which is leased by the Ipswich Historic Churches Trust, houses the oldest circle of church bells in the world. In 2023, the church became the backdrop for Amazon Prime's period drama Boudica: Queen of War, which looked at the failed revolt against the Roman Empire by the East Anglian tribal ruler.

Judge again bars Trump administration from deploying troops to Portland,"A federal judge in Oregon has once again barred President Donald Trump’s administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon until at least Friday PORTLAND, Ore. -- A federal judge in Oregon on Sunday barred President Donald Trump’s administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon until at least Friday, saying she “found no credible evidence” that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall. The city and state sued in September to block the deployment. It's the latest development in weeks of legal back-and-forth in Portland, Chicago and other U.S. cities as the Trump administration has moved to federalize and deploy the National Guard in city streets to quell protests. The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law. In a 16-page filing late Sunday, Immergut said she would issue a final order on Friday due to the voluminous evidence presented at trial, including more than 750 exhibits. The purpose of the deployment, according to the Trump administration, is to protect federal personnel and property where protests are occurring or likely to occur. Legal experts said that a higher appellate court order that remains in effect would have barred troops from being deployed anyway. Immergut wrote that most violence appeared to be between protesters and counter-protesters and found no evidence of “significant damage” to the immigration facility at the center of the protests. ""Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President’s federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,” she wrote. The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue — seek to push back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states’ sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because it has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces — one of the conditions set by Congress for calling up troops. Immergut issued two orders in early October that blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. She previously found that Trump had failed to show that he met the legal requirements for mobilizing the National Guard. She described his assessment of Portland, which Trump has called “war-ravaged” with “fires all over the place,” as “simply untethered to the facts.” One of Immergut’s orders was paused Oct. 20 by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But late Tuesday, the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the matter before an 11-judge panel. Until the larger panel rehears the case, the appeals court’s initial order from early October — under which the National Guard is federalized but not deployed — remains in effect. During the Portland trial, witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city’s ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Trump’s National Guard announcement. The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion” — another one of the conditions for calling up troops under federal law. Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., due to safety concerns. R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland’s ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter. He also said he was “surprised” to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down. Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified. Another Federal Protective Service official whom the judge also allowed to testify under his initials said protesters have at times been violent, damaged the facility and acted aggressively toward officers working at the building. The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer due to property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions. Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Scott Kennedy said that “without minimizing or condoning offensive expressions” or certain instances of criminal conduct, “none of these incidents suggest ... that there’s a rebellion or an inability to execute the laws.” ___ Johnson reported from Seattle. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2025-11-03 06:45:58,Abc News,negative,0.6627,23,Administration_To_Not," A federal judge in Oregon has barred President Donald Trump’s administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon until at least Friday .

"Women in Blue, World Champions: Tech titans Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella hail India’s historic World Cup win","New Delhi, Nov 3, 2025 Global tech leaders Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella joined millions of Indians in celebrating the country’s maiden triumph at the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025, lauding the team’s grit, inspiration, and historic achievement. Google CEO Sundar Pichai took to X to express his excitement after India’s thrilling victory over South Africa in the final at DY Patil Stadium on Sunday. “That was a nail-biting women’s world cup cricket final, memories of 1983 and 2011 indeed. Congrats to Team India, am sure will inspire a whole generation. Great tournament from South Africa too!” he wrote, drawing parallels between the women’s team’s triumph and India’s iconic men’s World Cup wins. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also saluted the champions in his post, declaring, “Women in Blue = World Champions! Respect to South Africa for making their first-ever final. A truly historic day for women’s cricket—new chapters written, barriers broken, legends born.” His words reflected the broader sentiment that India’s win marks a new era for women’s sport globally. The posts from two of the world’s most influential tech leaders underscored the worldwide recognition of India’s achievement. India’s women’s team made history by clinching their first-ever Women’s ODI World Cup, defeating South Africa by 52 runs. All-rounder Deepti Sharma was the star performer, scoring 58 runs and taking a five-wicket haul to seal the win. Put in to bat, India rode on Deepti’s fifty and a solid top-order effort to post 298/7 in 50 overs. The South African chase, anchored by captain Laura Wolvaardt’s valiant innings, ended at 246 in 45.3 overs, as the Indian bowlers held their nerve to script history. With this win, India became only the third country, after England and Australia, to have won both the men’s and women’s ODI World Cups. The triumph was even more special as the Indian team had endured a difficult journey, losing three consecutive matches in the group stage and barely qualifying for the semifinals. They then stunned Australia before overpowering South Africa in the final. The final, already being hailed as one of the greatest in tournament history, has not only united fans across the globe but also reaffirmed India’s growing dominance in world cricket.(Agency)",2025-11-03 06:45:56,Yes Punjab News,positive,0.833,17,Kohli_Wickets_Runs," Google CEO Sundar Pichai took to X to express his excitement after India’s thrilling victory over South Africa in the final at DY Patil Stadium on Sunday .

This extension encompasses 32 European countries alongside Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and several countries from South America and the Gulf region. Initially set to expire at the year's end, this policy aims to attract more foreign visitors, revitalize a tourism sector hit hard by stringent COVID-19 restrictions, and enhance international engagement. Notably, the United States, Canada, and Britain remain excluded from this list. The policy allows citizens from eligible nations to visit China for up to 30 days for business, tourism, or family visits without a visa. Furthermore, China is seeking to strengthen its ties with the European Union, a critical trading partner amid challenging trade relations. In addition, following discussions last week, Beijing confirmed a one-year suspension of its expanded rare earth export controls to the EU as part of efforts to stabilize industrial and supply chains.

BCCI announces Rs 51 crore reward as India’s women clinch maiden World Cup,"New Delhi, Nov 3: In a watershed moment for Indian cricket, the national women’s team etched their name in history by winning their first-ever ICC Women’s World Cup title, defeating South Africa by 52 runs in a pulsating final at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday night. Celebrations erupted across the country as BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia reportedly announced a Rs 51 crore reward for the players and support staff, hailing the victory as a “monumental achievement that will take Indian women’s cricket to a new level.” Meanwhile, IPL chairman Arun Dhumal lauded the team’s historic feat, drawing parallels with India’s iconic 1983 men’s World Cup triumph. “It’s a red-letter day for Indian women’s cricket. What the men’s team achieved in 1983, the Indian women have recreated today in Mumbai. This historic triumph will give a tremendous boost to women’s cricket in the country, and I’m confident our game will now reach new heights,” Dhumal said. Earlier, batting first, India posted a commanding 298/7, powered by Shafali Verma’s fluent 87, Deepti Sharma’s composed 58, and valuable contributions from Smriti Mandhana (45) and Richa Ghosh (34). A solid 100-run opening stand between Mandhana and Verma set the platform for a big total before South Africa clawed back late to keep India just under the 300-mark. Chasing 299, South Africa began confidently as Tazmin Brits and Laura Wolvaardt put together a brisk fifty-run opening partnership. But a sharp direct hit from Amanjot Kaur ended Brits’ stay, and from there, India seized control of the contest. Young pacer Sree Charani struck in her first over, trapping Anneke Bosch LBW, before Shafali Verma — shining with the ball as well — produced a game-turning spell, removing Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp in quick succession. Deepti Sharma then delivered a dream performance, claiming 5 for 39 to crush South Africa’s middle order. Despite Wolvaardt’s fighting 101, the Proteas fell short, bundled out for 246 in 45.3 overs, as India sealed a famous 52-run victory amid roaring home support. As the tricolour soared high and the players embraced in tears of joy, the moment marked not just a World Cup triumph — but the dawn of a new era for Indian women’s cricket.

"Liverpool injury update: Alexander Isak, Alisson Becker and Jeremie Frimpong latest news and return dates","Sport | Football Liverpool returned to winning ways with a 2-0 victory over Aston Villa to end their four-game losing streak in the Premier League. Pressure was piling on Arne Slot after the Reds slumped to ninth in the table, but even without a number of key players, the champions were able to sweep Villa aside to move back up to third. They welcome Real Madrid - Trent Alexander-Arnold, Xabi Alonso, et al - to Anfield in midweek, before they take on Manchester City in a mouth-watering encounter at the weekend. But will they have any of their star names back from injury? Ahead of a big few weeks, here’s all the latest Liverpool injury news and return dates... Alexander Isak has endured a tough start to life on Merseyside. Subbed at half-time in Liverpool’s 5-1 win over Frankfurt in the Champions League, Slot later revealed the £125million summer signing had suffered a minor groin injury. “Alexander had to go off at half-time because he felt his groin a little bit. That's a pity,” said Slot. “I've said many times it is such a difficult balance to find with a player that missed three months.” Isak was not in the squad in the 3-2 loss at Brentford, and he also missed out on the Carabao Cup defeat against Crystal Palace, as well as the win over Villa. No watering down of Hillsborough Law, says Lammy ahead of first debate Van Dijk hits back at Rooney over 'lazy' criticism of him and Salah Liverpool vs Real Madrid: Prediction, kick-off time, team news, odds Frieze season in London: here’s what not to miss Slot has provided no further update on the Swede. Potential return date: Unknown Jeremie Frimpong is facing a second spell on the sidelines, and he is just months into his Liverpool career. He suffered a hamstring injury against Bournemouth on his Premier League debut and suffered the same fate against Frankfurt. The right-back was dealt a further blow last week, with reports revealing that the Dutchman would be out of action for six weeks. That means that he could miss games against Aston Villa, Real Madrid, Manchester City, Nottingham Forest, PSV Eindhoven and West Ham at the very least. Potential return date: December Curtis Jones started against Brentford, but asked to be replaced in the second half after going down with an injury. The exact nature or severity of his issue is not clear but Slot did not seem overly alarmed by his condition when he spoke at full-time. He said: “We have to wait and see. He asked to be taken off. He walked off instead of needing a lot of treatment so I have to wait and see.” He was not involved in the squads against Palace or Villa. Potential return date: Unknown Alisson Becker suffered a hamstring injury against Galatasaray in September. Speaking ahead of the Brentford game, Slot said: ""Alisson is not in the squad tomorrow. That's also going to take a little bit longer."" Slot had previously suggested that Alisson was weeks away from returning but this week’s two key games - as much as the Reds would love their first-choice shot-stopper back - may come too soon. Potential return date: November Leoni suffered an ACL injury on his Liverpool debut against Southampton back in September. The 18-year-old impressed in his first minutes in red, but was stretchered off shortly after. He later underwent surgery and is expected to spend a year on the sidelines. “He’s not in a good place, of course,” Slot said of the Italian. “He tore his ACL which means that he will be out for around a year.” Potential return date: Late 2026 MORE ABOUT",2025-11-03 06:45:52,Evening Standard,positive,0.8818,71,Alexander_Focused_Goal, Liverpool beat Aston Villa 2-0 to end their four-game losing streak in the Premier League .

What's on the ballot in the first general election since Donald Trump became president,"Donald Trump features prominently in state and local elections happening Tuesday, a year after he retook the White House WASHINGTON -- One year after Donald Trump retook the White House and set into motion a dramatic expansion of executive power, the Republican president figures prominently in state and local elections being held Tuesday. The results of those contests — the first general election of Trump's second term — will be heralded by the victors as either a major repudiation or resounding stamp of approval of his second-term agenda. That's especially true in high-profile races for Virginia and New Jersey governor, New York City mayor and a California proposition to redraw its congressional district boundaries. More than half of the states will hold contests on Tuesday. Here's a look at some of the major statewide and local races on the ballot: In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are the nominees to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. Sherrill is a four-term U.S. representative and former Navy helicopter pilot. Ciattarelli is a former state Assemblyman backed by Trump. In 2021, Ciattarelli came within about 3 percentage points of toppling Murphy. In Virginia, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and Democratic former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger look to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. While Spanberger has made some efforts to focus on topics other than Trump in stump speeches, the president remained a major topic of conversation throughout the campaign, from comments Earle-Sears made about him in 2022 to some of his more polarizing policies, such as the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill tax and spending cut measure and the widespread dismissal of federal workers, many of whom live in northern Virginia. Trump was scheduled to participate in telephone rallies for the candidates on Monday night. As the only gubernatorial races held in the year following a presidential election, the contests have long served as the first major test of voter sentiment toward the party holding the White House. In every race for governor since 1973, one or both states have elected a governor from a party different than that of the sitting president. The race to lead the nation’s largest city features Democratic state legislator Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate and former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani’s comfortable victory over Cuomo in the June primary generated excitement from the party’s more progressive wing and apprehension among the party establishment. Party leaders like Gov. Kathy Hochul and U.S. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries eventually endorsed the self-described democratic socialist months after he won the nomination. The winner will replace outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, who initially sought renomination as a Democrat. After losing the primary Adams opted to run as an independent, but dropped out of the race in September and eventually endorsed Cuomo. In February, the Trump Justice Department asked a court to drop corruption charges against Adams because the case impeded Trump’s “ immigration objectives.” Trump later said he’d like to see both Adams and Sliwa drop out of the race in an effort to defeat Mamdani. California voters will decide a statewide ballot measure that would enact a new congressional map that could flip as many as five Republican-held U.S. House seats to Democratic control. Proposition 50, championed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, is in response to a new Texas map that state Republicans enacted in August as part of Trump’s efforts to keep the U.S. House under Republican control in the 2026 midterms. The Texas plan, which could help Republicans flip five Democratic-held U.S. House seats, has sparked an escalating gerrymandering arms race among states to pass new maps outside of the regular once-a-decade schedule. Control of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will be at stake when voters cast Yes or No votes on whether to retain three justices from the high court’s 5-2 Democratic majority. Partisan control of the court could have major implications for the 2028 presidential race, since justices might be asked to rule on election disputes, as they did in 2020. Spending on Tuesday's contests is on track to exceed $15 million as Republicans have campaigned to end the majority and Democrats have responded. If all three justices are ousted, a deadlock in the confirmation process to replace them could result in a court tied at 2-2. An election to fill any vacant seats for full 10-year terms would be held in 2027. VIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Republican incumbent Jason Miyares seeks a second term against Democrat Jay Jones. Much of the fall campaign has focused on text messages suggesting violence against political rivals that Jones sent in 2022. TEXAS-18: Sixteen candidates hope to fill a vacant congressional seat previously held by the late Democratic U.S. Rep. Sylvester Turner. STATE LEGISLATURES: Control of the Minnesota Senate and Virginia House of Delegates is at stake, while New Jersey Democrats defend their 52-28 General Assembly majority. BALLOT MEASURES: Maine voters will decide statewide questions on voting and a “red flag” law aimed at preventing gun violence. Texas’ 17 ballot measures include constitutional amendments on parental rights and limiting voting to U.S. citizens. Colorado and Washington also have statewide measures on the ballot. MAYORS: Detroit, Pittsburgh, Jersey City and Buffalo will elect new mayors, while incumbents in Atlanta, Minneapolis and Cincinnati seek another term. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the 2025 election at 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2025-11-03 06:45:51,Abc News,positive,0.5557,9,Tariffs_Candidate_Republicans, Donald Trump features prominently in state and local elections being held Tuesday .

Asking Eric: Does my husband’s family exclude him from birthday tradition because they think he’s rich?,"Dear Eric: My husband and I have been married for almost 10 years. He has three siblings, and it seems like he’s the forgotten one. His mom and siblings always put money together and send it for each other’s birthdays. Last year and the year before that, they did it for everyone’s birthday except my husband. He was very upset about it but said nothing. This year his mom asked him and his siblings to send money to give another sibling for their birthday. My husband, of course, sent the money. I’m tired of my husband participating in everyone’s birthday and then being ignored for his. I would love to speak up and say something but not sure it’s my place to do that as an in-law. I’m just trying to figure out if there’s a nice way to let them know how hurtful it is or if there’s a way to get out of sending money since my husband is excluded. I would like to add that they all get along great and they’re close so not sure why he’s always left out. His mom did tell one of her friends not to send us anything because we make too much money and don’t need it. Our income is average/barely middle class for the state we live in. We are not rich and one of his siblings makes more money than us. I’m frustrated about the whole situation and would appreciate your advice on how to handle it. – Fed Up with Exclusions Dear Fed Up: It sounds like your husband could use an advocate and the family could use some help with communication. You can start the ball rolling on both by taking the reins. Rally folks yourself for your husband’s birthday. You can even tell his mother and siblings, “I notice that this is a family tradition, and I think it makes him feel left out to not get anything for his birthday, so I decided to organize on his behalf this year. It will mean a lot.” The other family members might see your point and gladly chip in. Or they might protest, and this is where the conversation about money might come up, giving you a chance to correct their misconception. Also, if they don’t want to give money, surely there’s some other way they include him. Ultimately, from your view, it’s not so much about cash as it is about feeling loved. Lead with that and it may help your husband’s mother and siblings open their eyes, and, potentially, their wallets. Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O.

The real test of Lee’s pragmatic diplomacy comes after APEC,"The end of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Gyeongju marked the conclusion of a crucial, jam-packed week of diplomacy for South Korea, with the leaders of two superpowers — the US and China — both in attendance. At the helm of the first large-scale international summit event hosted by South Korea in 20 years was President Lee Jae Myung, who cleared away economic and security-related uncertainties by wrapping up negotiations with the US while taking the first steps to repair Seoul’s estrangement from Beijing. Lee also met with other leaders in the Asia-Pacific region and shored up trust aimed at building a future of shared prosperity. But many observers are saying the real challenge starts now as South Korea seeks to navigate the kind of worst-case scenario that it narrowly avoided by adopting a pragmatic focus on national interests amid a rapidly changing “new normal” in the global order. “We did a pretty good job of toughing things out in a situation where the outcome was never going to be 100% satisfactory to us,” assessed Korea National Diplomatic Academy professor Jun Bong-geun on Sunday regarding the agreements reached on trade and security matters at a South Korea-US summit. “For now, the fog has been cleared away,” he added, suggesting the outcomes can be viewed positively as Lee having taken care of immediate uncertainties while sidestepping a worst-case scenario in dealing with US President Donald Trump, who is known for unpredictability. Along similar lines, former KNDA Chancellor Hong Hyun-ik said that Lee had “made the best available choice without stalling for time in a world where the ‘new normal’ is US overreach.” The arrangement reached on the biggest issue concerning the fund for South Korean investment in the US — where the total of cash investment was set at US$200 billion and capped at US$20 billion annually — was more or less a realistic compromise solution. In other words, Seoul went for the next-best or least-worst option under hegemonic trade pressures from the Trump administration. Commenting on this, Kim Joon-hyung, a former chancellor of the KDNA and current Rebuilding Korea Party lawmaker, said that South Korea “will need to adjust the pace, frequency and intensity of investment during the future implementation process.” In the summit’s immediate wake, the US made claims that conflicted with the South Korean government’s announcement, including Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick’s insistence that semiconductor tariffs were not part of the agreement. Kim’s remarks suggested that Seoul will need to adopt a firm stance as differences arise between the two sides in the implementation process. Observers similarly rated Lee’s summit with Xi Jinping as a generally successful first step, with the Chinese president taking steps to repair relations on his first visit to South Korea in 11 years. Seoul and Beijing have been on distant terms owing to friction over the deployment of a US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile system in Korea in 2016 and foreign policies under the Yoon Suk-yeol administration that were heavily skewed toward the US. While the summit did not fulfill hopes for a second-phase upgrade to the two sides’ free trade agreement or securing China’s definite support for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, analysts suggested this was more than could be expected as a first step. According to sources, Xi and Lee appeared to enjoy a pleasant conversation at a closed-door dinner, where they openly discussed advancements in bilateral relations. What remains now is the task of translating that into concrete improvements, including the lifting of Chinese restrictions on Korean cultural content. “While relations with the US and Japan have substantially progressed and been established, we’re still working on restoring trust with China, so we should strongly consider a visit to China before the end of the year,” Hong said. Some observers in the diplomatic world said that for Lee’s “pragmatic diplomacy” to truly contribute to upholding the national interest, he will need to focus on balanced diplomacy between China and the US now that Korea is back on track to restoring its relationship with the former and the latter continues to demand one-sided sacrifices from its allies. One source in the foreign affairs community stressed, “We need to avoid the situation where we’re pressed to take sides as the competition between the US and China intensifies, and that will require the wisdom to manage bilateral relations well from the middle ground.” By Um Ji-won, staff reporter Please direct questions or comments to [english@hani.co.kr]",2025-11-03 08:04:00,Hani,positive,0.6981,7,Tariffs_Trump_Cooperation," The end of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Gyeongju marked the conclusion of a crucial, jam-packed week of diplomacy for South Korea .

Accounting experts call for public inquiry into Birmingham bankruptcy,"Warakorn - stock.adobe.com Thirty-five accounting, finance and local government experts have signed an open letter to local government minister Steve Reed, calling for a public inquiry into the bankruptcy of Birmingham City Council. The open letter, which looks at the latest accounts from the council, notes that some of the figures used to “bankrupt” Birmingham City Council, including forecast levels of reserves and alleged equal pay liabilities, look like they have been materially misstated. Since the failed implementation of an Oracle enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to replace SAP in April 2022, the council has faced significant issues with the processes and interfaces, as well as the system’s ability to produce reports. In effect, the council was unable to find out what money was being spent, what it was owed and how much it had received. Budget forecasting had to be carried out based on the best available data and organisational intelligence. In April 2023, council leader John Cotton discussed the disastrous implementation of the ERP system, and in September 2023, the council issued a Section 114 bankruptcy notice. Birmingham City Council’s Section 114 bankruptcy notice led to a rise in the council’s borrowing costs, an 18% rise in Council Tax bills, along with the ongoing bin strike dispute with Unite the Union. Significantly, the council has had to cut its budget and sell assets to help it reduce costs. The letter also states that there has been a steep rise in external audit fees and the significant costs charged by the city’s commissioners, who were appointed without the usual best value assessment. In a post on X, James Brackley a lecturer in accounting at University of Glasgow, who prepared an analysis of the accounting at Birmingham City Council, wrote: “The latest analysis proves beyond doubt that Birmingham was never ‘bankrupt’ with the bankruptcy & subsequent intervention being based on imagined data as the authority underestimated its reserves and exaggerated its (non-existent) deficits by hundreds of millions of pounds. This has since led to the biggest program of cuts and asset sales any authority has ever faced.” He added that the asset sales in 2024/25 against an underlying balanced position actually led to huge surpluses across all core reserves in the latest accounts. Commenting on the post, Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, tweeted: “Government Commissioners, being paid £1200 a day, are not needed. Unite repeatedly advised the council that their figures were simply wrong, as was their legal advice. This is a disgraceful tale. Yet again, workers and residents are paying the price for a crisis and incompetence not of their making.” Following the publication of a Grant Thornton report in February 2025, which looked at what went wrong with the implementation of the Oracle system, the council revised the implementation of Oracle to April 2026. However, as of September 2025, it is believed that the income management system (IMS) at Birmingham City Council – a key application that needs to work with the Oracle system – is not fully working. Previously, the lack of a fully functioning IMS meant workarounds were needed for financial reporting.",2025-11-03 08:04:00,Computerweekly News,neutral,0.4659,6,Executive_Government_Plans," Thirty-five accounting, finance and local government experts have signed an open letter to local government minister Steve Reed calling for a public inquiry into the bankruptcy of Birmingham City Council .

Amol Muzumdar: One of the greatest to never play for India carves his own cricketing legacy,"New Delhi: Despite scoring truckloads of runs in domestic cricket, Amol Muzumdar’s dream of representing India never saw the light of day. Perhaps, fate had planned it all along. During his school days, Muzumdar was rated highly along with his schoolmates Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli at Shardashram Vidyamandir School in Mumbai. Coached by Ramakant Achrekar, Muzumdar once famously waited with his pads on for two days as Achrekar’s other two students, Tendulkar and Kambli, shared a world-record 664-run partnership in a 1988 school. Mazumdar never got a chance to bat, and while Tendulkar and Kambli went on to play for India, Muzumdar, despite proving himself in domestic cricket year after year, kept waiting for his chance and finally ended a two-decade-long illustrious career in 2014. It was destiny’s call that a player of Muzumdar’s calibre couldn’t don the India colours. It was destiny’s call, too, that 11 years after retirement, he realised his India dream by guiding the women’s team to a historic maiden ODI World Cup title. After his playing days were over, Muzumdar transitioned to coaching and built a reputation as a mentor who is an expert in reading players and situations. In domestic cricket, he coached Mumbai, Andhra, and later worked with the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL before moving to the international stage with a stint with South Africa’s cricket team as a batting consultant. When Muzumdar was appointed as India’s women’s coach in 2023, the team was in turmoil after years of instability in the coaching set-up. However, he quickly won over the dressing room, built the foundation of a cohesive team and rallied the team to aim towards one goal. His leadership style worked wonders for the team and superstar players like Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana, and Deepti Sharma. After a solid start to the campaign, the Women in Blue suffered multiple setbacks, which threatened to derail their campaign. However, Muzumdar’s strong reminder to the team of their abilities and goal helped India regroup and find a newfound energy and rhythm. Listening to a man who embodies grit and resilience worked like a magic potion for the team, evident from two extraordinary performances – vs Australia in the semifinal and vs South Africa in the final. On November 2, 2025, the historic day when India defeated South Africa to lift their maiden World Cup, life came a full circle for Muzumdar, one of the greatest cricketers to never play for India.

Real reason Andrew's Royal Lodge eviction announcement took so long,"Andrew hit an all-time royal low last week as it was announced he was to be stripped of all his royal titles and evicted from his 30-room Royal Lodge home. Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming. While the King’s actions have been praised, some believe the monarch, 76, took too long to take action, especially over evicting the former prince from his Crown Estate mansion, however Queen Elizabeth's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson has now explained why.

Anderson also said the situation would have been “difficult” for the King, especially as Andrew is his younger brother. She said: “It must be mixed emotions for him (the King). That is why this has taken such a long time. It is family and monarchy, and when the lines are blurred, it’s very difficult for them.” Andrew is expected to leave Royal Lodge within months despite originally having a lease until 2078.

Indore News: Metro To Go Underground From Khajrana Square,"Indore (Madhya Pradesh): The Indore Metro route will now go underground from Khajrana Square itself, passing through Palasia to Bada Ganpati, as approved in a high-level meeting chaired by urban development and housing minister Kailash Vijayvargiya on Monday. The decision, finalized after hours of detailed discussions, is being hailed as a major step towards improving traffic management and urban mobility in the city. The proposal for the underground stretch of the metro from Khajrana to Bada Ganpati via Palasia received unanimous approval. Minister Vijayvargiya said, “This decision will prove historic for Indore, both for the city’s economic growth as well as traffic management. Together, we will make this project a success.” He said that all public representatives unanimously decided to make the Metro train route underground from the Khajrana area. He explained that in the earlier design, the Metro was planned to go underground from Nath Mandir Road near the high court, to Bada Ganpati. However, under the new plan, the route would now be taken underground from Khajrana itself. The minister further informed that a Malharganj Metro station would be constructed, but no houses or shops would be affected in the process. Using advanced tunnelling technology, similar to the one used in Chandni Chowk (Delhi), a machine would bore the tunnel without causing any surface damage. Vijayvargiya added, “We will hold meetings with local residents to explain that the Metro team must be allowed to work. Not even a flowerpot will be broken, everything will remain just as it is.” More about this section will be decided in detail after the company redesigns a significant route for the proposed underground track. Then feasibility testing and soil testing of the route will be started. The minister also directed officials to immediately disconnect all illegal water connections linked to under-construction water tanks and distribution lines under the AMRUT scheme. He emphasized that all road restoration work must be carried out using cutting machines rather than manual digging to maintain technical quality. Mayor Pushyamitra Bhargav instructed that construction work under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana be completed at the earliest and suggested appointing a traffic engineer to plan future mobility systems. He also raised concern over the slow progress of the Marathi Kala Sankul project under the Smart City. Additional chief secretary Sanjay Dubey directed that vacant land in the MOG Lines area be developed with attractive designs. He also emphasized simplifying the TDR process and ensuring that sewage, water supply and stormwater lines were integrated into all new road projects. Minister Vijayvargiya said that officers would be held accountable for the rise in illegal colonies and instructed the launch of a strict campaign to prevent unauthorized construction. He urged officials to involve public representatives in all major decision-making processes to ensure better implementation and transparency. Highlighting Indore as Madhya Pradesh’s first self-reliant city, the minister said that the Municipal Corporation must focus on increasing revenue and reducing expenditure while maintaining high-quality infrastructure. He also praised the Mayor for his long-term vision of the Narmada Phase-IV project, calling it a farsighted step for Indore’s future. During the meeting, various development projects under AMRUT Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Smart City Mission and Indore Metro Project were comprehensively reviewed. Senior officials from the Indore Municipal Corporation, Indore Development Authority and Metro Rail Corporation were present. Rajya Sabha MP Kavita Patidar, Mayor Pushyamitra Bhargav, MLAs Madhu Verma, Mahendra Hardia, Golu Shukla, Metro MD S Krishna Chaitanya, commissioner Dr Sudam Khade, municipal commissioner Dilip Kumar Yadav, IDA CEO Dr Parikshit Jhade and other senior officials were also present.",2025-11-03 20:08:00,The Free Press Journal,positive,0.8335,4,2025_Audit_Proceedings," Indore Metro route will now go underground from Khajrana Square itself, passing through Palasia to Bada Ganpati .

Small firms want govt to prioritise forex solutions,"Small Scale Business Importers and Exporters Association has appealed to the new administration to prioritise addressing foreign exchange scarcity, describing it as the backbone of the country’s economic challenges. The association’s secretary general Frank Mhango said this in Lilongwe on Friday at a time foreign exchange reserves continue to decline and are now recorded at below one month of import cover, thereby straining business operations. Briefing journalists, he warned that if businesses continue to access foreign exchange from the black market, prices of goods and services will continue to rise. Mhango said apart from medium to long-term solutions such as increasing production and securing forex inflows from development partners, the Reserve Bank of Malawi should follow up with commercial banks on how they are rationing the available forex. He claimed that some banks allocate forex to a few companies at the expense of small and medium enterprises operations. “Our message to the new administration is that they should put foreign exchange issues seriously because if we continue getting the dollar at K4 000 on black market, then things will continue to worse,” said Mhango. The group’s executive member Alfred Manda also raised outstanding taxation issues that Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) should address, including duty on tax-compliant traders. He said: “We also wanted express our commitment to ensure that our sector is formalised and that all our members should comply with Taxation Act. “We also need MRA to set standard and reasonable duty to importers because some members complain that they are being overtaxed.” In an interview on Sunday, Reserve Bank of Malawi spokesperson Boston Maliketi Banda acknowledged that short-term solutions such as demand management and currency devaluations have proven ineffective to address the foreign exchange challenges. He said the central bank is collaborating with the government, the financial industry and the private sector to prioritise and invest in productive sectors with high export potential. “The country’s persistent foreign exchange shortages are a symptom of a deep-rooted, structural imbalance. For decades, our imports have significantly exceeded our exports,” said Maliketi Banda. In a separate interview on Sunday, Financial Market Dealers Association president Leslie Fatch said reduced supply of foreign exchange has affected commercial banks’ ability to service the market, adding that rationing forex is just a reaction to the drop in supply. “Considering that structural challenges are yet to be fully addressed in the market, for now banks have to actively prioritise on which bills to be serviced with the limited resources,” he said. In August this year, RBM announced a reduction in the mandatory conversion rate for export revenues from 30 percent to 25 percent, with further reductions for qualifying companies anticipated.",2025-11-04 08:05:00,The Nation Online,negative,0.4613,42,Market_Between_Business, Small Scale Business Importers and Exporters Association has appealed to the new administration to prioritise addressing foreign exchange scarcity .

Trump administration says SNAP will return after court order,"MOSCOW — Cass Davis spent the last week fishing as much as he could. He couldn’t afford not to, he said. Depending on how quickly he gets his food stamps, he might need it. “ I’ve been going salmon fishing despite the fact that I got a cold and I was miserable this morning,” he said. “ I really want to put a whole bunch of smoked salmon in my freezer.” Davis, a Moscow resident, lives on a fixed income due to disabilities. To get to his fishing spot, he barters with friends to give fishing lessons in exchange for a ride; he can’t afford the gas. Davis is one of roughly 130,000 Idahoans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. In Washington, that number is about 888,000 people. SNAP covers about $200 of Davis’ monthly groceries. He said the stress of worrying about finances has been bad for his health. “What they’ve done by taking away my food stamps is put me in a real pickle,” he said. “It’s more than I’m not eating right. I’m stressing like hell now.” On Friday, two federal judges ruled the Trump administration must use contingency funds to continue SNAP benefits. Federal Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday those benefits might resume as early as Wednesday. But other agencies who work with SNAP recipients have expressed skepticism about that timeline, stating it might take weeks for funds to come through. A representative for Idaho Health and Welfare said the agency did not have formal guidance on when SNAP benefits would be distributed. Janna Jones is the manager at the West Side Food Pantry in Moscow, operated by the nonprofit Inland Oasis. She said this month, she expects to see more families with children using the pantry. “Families have the hardest time extending their dollars,” she said. “If you’re looking at SNAP benefits, the largest population are households with children.” Roughly 36% of SNAP recipients are children, according to the Pew Research Center. The pantry held a food drive in response to the SNAP cutoff deadline Sunday. It collected 8,342 pounds of food from that drive and donations the week before. That’s a heartening sign, said volunteer Nick Koenig. “ We show up for community,” Koenig said. “We’re gonna still have our pantry doors open for you.” Still, if SNAP isn’t restored, the number of people who are on it in Moscow could roughly double the pantry’s current numbers, Koenig said. If that many people came in, the pantry would need a lot more food drives. “I think we could do a week, with what we’ve gotten thus far,” Koenig said. Even before the uncertainty with SNAP, the food pantry’s monthly use had grown from almost 1,400 in September 2022 to 2,156 this September. Two of the largest groups with increased pantry usage have been seniors and low-income people with full-time-jobs. Davis said he’s been lucky enough to be able to rely on friends who can help him out. When his van broke down last month, it cost him $1,600, some of which he had to borrow from friends. He’s now trying to pay that off. But Davis said he worries losing SNAP will put him into more debt. “ I don’t really think that people who work in Washington, D.C., really understand what ‘poor’ is,” Davis said. “People who are trying to pay rent, and pay utilities, and pay insurance, and everything that we have to — it equals no money after bills are paid.” Jessica Proctor manages the Deary Community Food Bank. She said some patrons drive from as far as Clarkia — about 30 minutes away — to use the food bank. That’s in part because until recently, it hadn’t needed to limit visitors to a certain amount of food. “We’ve gotten so little meat that we have to basically hand it out when people come in to make sure everyone gets one,” Proctor said. “Because if people panic … they’ll try to take as much as they can.” She’s also bracing for more people to need the pantry after a worse-than-average hunting season, she said. “A lot of people are dependent on elk and deer. But we have had this bluetongue disease and chronic wasting disease,” she said. Regardless of when SNAP returns, food pantry staff say there will be a continual need for donations. When donating food, Jones said, it’s especially helpful to buy flats of one staple instead of shopping for one imagined family. “Get about two things, but multiples of it. Get two or three flats of jelly and get a case of cornbread mix and bring that in,” she said. “Because what you’ve done is you have just filled the gap, and you’ve provided a more egalitarian choice for food pantries.” Jones also noted that pantries will be especially in need of donations in the new year. “People get very generous over the holidays and we really appreciate it,” she said. “People get burnt out through the holidays and by January most of the shelves start looking a little bit empty.” Most food pantries also take monetary donations to buy foods they need directly, which can help with filling unexpected needs, especially when needs are hard to predict.

Joseph (Joe) Milazzo,"Birth: 1934 Death: 2025 Joseph (“Joe”) Salvatore Milazzo passed away on October 23, 2025, one day after his 91st birthday, surrounded in love by his daughters. Born in Pittston, Pennsylvania, Joe spent the last 46 years of his life in Anaheim, California — a place he grew to love and call home. Joe was devoted to his family. He was married to his adoring wife, Anna Marie, for many years before she passed away almost six years ago. Together they built a loving home filled with warmth, laughter, and countless memories. She was the love of his life. He is survived by his daughters, Barbara Webright and Joanne Mizell, and their husbands, John Webright and Gary Mizell; his grandson, Cody Webright; his stepsons, David Spinney and Bill Spinney; and two grandchildren from his marriage to Anna Marie, Austin Spinney and Allison Rodriguez. Joe is also lovingly remembered by his nephew, Sam Milazzo; great-nephew, Jason Milazzo; great-niece, Jen Kanehl; and nieces Alice Milazzo and Sue Doty. His youngest daughter, Cathy, sadly passed away early in life, and we know they are now reunited in Heaven. Joe proudly served his country as a veteran of the Korean War. After his military service, he dedicated his life to education as a teacher in the Anaheim School District. He touched the lives of countless students over the years — not just through lessons, but through kindness, patience, and genuine care. He was a man of community and connection. Joe was a longtime member of St. Norbert Catholic Church in Orange and found joy in faith and fellowship. He was also a member of the Long Beach Speakers Club, where he shared his love of words, humor, and storytelling. He enjoyed fellowship and service as a member of First Friday Friars club. Outside of work, Joe had many passions. He loved to entertain and was always known as the most gracious and generous host. He was an avid tennis player well into his eighties and loved the energy and camaraderie of the game. He was also a voracious reader — finishing two or three books every week — always curious, always learning. Some of Joe’s happiest moments were spent right at home, sitting on his patio surrounded by friends and family, enjoying good conversation and a good cigar. He enjoyed a competitive game of Skip-Bo with family after dinner. Those simple, meaningful moments were what he treasured most. Joe was known for his generosity, his thoughtfulness, and his gentle spirit. He had a nurturing heart and was always looking after others. His weekly breakfasts with lifelong friends were a cherished tradition that lasted decades, filled with laughter and stories that only grew better with time. He was, in every sense, both a gentleman and a gentle man — kind, considerate, and full of quiet strength. Though Joe will be deeply missed, his love, wisdom, and warmth will continue to live on in all who were lucky enough to call him family and friend. Viewing will take place from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm on November 17, 2025, at Hilgenfeld Mortuary in Anaheim, California.

Patrick M Mehtonen,"Birth: 1955 Death: 2025 Patrick M Mehtonen peacefully passed away October 28, 2025 in Ukiah. He was born on November 25, 1955. Pat is survived by friends and hunting buddies who have been enriched by his life and love for his ranch. He was preceded in death by his sister, Marsha; mother, Wanda Burke Mehtonen and father, Marcus Mehtonen. Pat grew up as a traditional Mendocino County rancher. Raising sheep, hunting, riding horses, and living off the land as much as possible. Over the years, as it became harder to make a living on sheep alone, he was able to turn his passion for hunting into a livelihood. Never one to need luxury, he lived his entire life on his ranch where he considered it the greatest place on Earth, constantly working to keep everything running as only a rancher could. He was tough as nails, never complained, and could fix anything with baling wire and whatever he could find laying around. He didn’t just love his ranch it was his life and his legacy, having begun as a homestead by his maternal grandfather William P. Burke in the late 1800s. According to family lore, the Burke’s were the first people to find a way to bring a covered wagon into Ukiah Valley. That toughness and determination was a trait Pat certainly inherited. His greatest joy was spending time at his cabin, eating, drinking, hunting, laughing, and sharing memories and experiences with anyone who would join him. Although he never had children of his own, being a father figure came naturally to him. He was a role model to many, and everyone who spent time with him learned how to enjoy a simplified life. His sense of humor and spontaneity was always on full display and a joy to be around. The Mehtonen Ranch will live on and be a place to carry on the tradition of his family his biggest ambition. Pat’s one-of-a-kind personality, humor, jokes, and love for his ranch and hunting will forever be missed and never forgotten. So many cherished memories to reflect upon. A celebration of life will be hosted by the Crudo family at Mike & Teresa Crudo’s home on Sunday, November 16th at one o’clock. Bring your stories and photos to share.

Eagles vs Packers Predictions - Early Picks & Odds for Monday Night Football Week 10,"Ponnaiya's prediction: Hurts delivers at Lambeau. The Philadelphia Eagles lock horns with the Green Bay Packers in Monday Night Football in Week 10. The Eagles are fresh off their bye after back-to-back wins, while the Pacers are coming off an upset loss on Sunday. My early Eagles vs. Packers predictions are expecting a lower-scoring game while backing Philadelphia as a short road underdog. Here are my NFL picks for this Monday Night showdown. Here are our early thoughts on the spread and total for this week’s game. We will have a full game preview (with a best bet and SGP) later in the week. -110 at bet365 The Philadelphia Eagles are 6-2 and won back-to-back games before going on their bye in Week 9. The week off should have allowed superstar running back Saquon Barkley and No. 1 wide receiver A.J. Brown to recover from niggling injuries. Philadelphia's offense is trending in the right direction. Jalen Hurts has completed 71.1% of his passes for 1068 yards with 10 touchdowns and one pick over the last four games. Meanwhile, Barkley finally broke out with 150 rushing yards in Week 8. The Green Bay Packers were 13.5-point favorites last week but ended up falling 16-13 to the Panthers. They lost tight end Tucker Kraft to a season-ending injury in that game, which is yet another blow to a banged-up receiver group. Quarterback Jordan Love has been trying to do too much, which has resulted in holding on to the ball too long and some bad throws. With so many of his top targets sidelined, he'll have a tough time throwing against a Philly D that is fourth in the league in opponent pass rating. Especially with the Eagles bolstering their pass rush by trading for Jaelen Phillips. -110 at bet365 With the season-ending injury to Kraft, Jayden Reed on the IR, and rookie wideout Matthew Golden dealing with a shoulder injury, Green Bay's offense will have a tough time moving the ball through the air. That said, the Packers have a strong pass defense themselves, ranking eighth in the league in defensive dropback success rate. They are allowing just 16.3 ppg at home, and even in last week's upset loss to the Panthers, their defense showed up. These teams will have to lean on their rushing attacks if they want to move the chains on Monday. That will be even more emphasized in a cold-weather game with temperatures expected to be close to freezing at Lambeau. Both offenses play at a slow tempo, with Green Bay 26th in the league in seconds per play and Philadelphia 30th. That sluggish pace and a reliance on running the ball should lead to the clock getting chewed up and the Under cashing.

Sticker shock? Wyomingites could see skyrocketing bills on ACA health insurance marketplace,"When the Affordable Care Act marketplace, where roughly 42,000 Wyoming residents get their health insurance, opened enrollment Saturday, customers likely faced a double whammy: higher prices and fewer resources. The landscape looks different this year between federal changes to the marketplace’s administration and the ongoing government shutdown — caused in part by a deadlock over ACA tax credits designed to make insurance cheaper for consumers. As things stand, consumers are generally experiencing less help in navigating the system, seeing higher premium costs for plans and facing new reporting requirements. In some cases, people could find their health insurance costs spiking by thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars annually. Wyomingites have two months to shop for a plan before open enrollment closes Jan. 15. WyoFile reached out to experts and gathered information and tips for residents to keep in mind through the process: The Affordable Care Act marketplace is available to people who don’t qualify for Medicaid and don’t have insurance through an employer. Open enrollment is the annual window when individuals and families can sign up for health insurance through the ACA, adjust their plans or cancel coverage. Price jumps aren’t uncommon as insurers do raise premiums over time, but this year those increases will be larger due to the expiration of some enhanced premium tax credits. “Health insurance has always been and continues to be very, very expensive,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor with Georgetown’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. “But going into 2026, it’s only going to get more expensive.” The tax credits were created in 2021 to essentially lower monthly out-of-pocket costs for ACA consumers, in some cases, all the way to $0. Congress did not extend them in the One Big Beautiful Bill in July, and an attempt to extend them now is one of the factors driving the government shutdown. The average ACA marketplace consumer will likely pay about 100% more for coverage in 2026, according to a fact sheet from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. In Wyoming, the impacts will vary depending on income, demographics and other factors. According to Healthy Wyoming, a 60-year-old couple with an annual income of $82,000 will face an increase of $37,422 in annual health care costs due to the tax credit loss. The premium increase for a 45-year-old who earns $62,000 annually could be upwards of $6,000. In the past, health “navigators” — professionals who guide customers through what can be a confusing open enrollment process — have been available largely thanks to federal funds. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, however, slashed that funding by 90% this year. As a result, Enroll Wyoming, which offered free navigator help to those looking for insurance, experienced a significant budget cut. Despite paring down its staff from 10 individuals to just one full-time and one part-time employee, Enroll Wyoming will still offer services. “Enroll Wyoming stresses that it will be still around to educate and empower consumers,” reads an August press release. The nonprofit will have more emphasis on online and phone communication in its new iteration, the release says. “At the same time, Enroll Wyoming is building a statewide network of partners to provide more referral support.” Consumers will also have fewer options. Mountain Health Co-op announced in August that it will no longer offer health plans in Wyoming at the end of the year. That means Wyoming will be down to just two providers. Finally, people should brace for more paperwork, Corlette said. That can include filing extra forms or submitting paperwork to reflect any changes in income. Enrollment opened Saturday. To get coverage starting Jan. 1, consumers must enroll in a plan by Dec. 15. If they enroll between Dec. 15 and the closing date of Jan. 15, coverage will start Feb. 1. If people are already enrolled and do nothing, they will be automatically re-enrolled in their plans. The ACA marketplace only opened up what’s called “window shopping” two days before enrollment began, Corlette said, which means that it’s been hard for customers to suss out their new options. “Also, the federal government told insurance companies that for this year only, they don’t have to include premium information in the notices that they send to consumers, which usually go out in October,” she added. That could further veil price changes. “I can imagine some people will be taken by surprise,” she said. “This will be a uniquely challenging year.” First, Corlette said, they can contact their members of Congress to urge them to find more affordable solutions and let them know “the delay is not helping anyone.” Next, she said, they should stay informed. “If you see your premium is unaffordable, don’t lose hope. There is still a chance that Congress will strike a deal here and provide premium relief.” Folks can hold off until Dec. 15, Corlette noted; they don’t have to rush into anything. If they do decide to leave the marketplace and look elsewhere, Corlette said, they should have caution. “There’s a lot of junk out there and a lot of aggressive marketing, so just be careful,” she said, adding that using a local insurance broker who can meet in person is generally a good way to help sort the quality plans from those that don’t offer much financial protection. What Corlette fears at this point is that “a lot of people will check their accounts, see their premium, get sticker shock, and say, ‘I can’t afford this,’ and walk away. “And once they walk away, it’s really, really hard to get them to come back,” she said. “I think there’s still time for Congress to act, but probably too late to be sure that everybody stays insured.” If people opt out of marketplace insurance, it would likely trigger even more cost increases. According to BlueCrossBlueShield Wyoming, when healthier people leave the marketplace, those who remain often require more care. That drives up costs for everyone.

Murphy's Taproom closes after 19 years in Manchester,"Murphy’s Taproom on Elm Street in Manchester is permanently closed. Murphy’s Taproom has been a mainstay of Elm Street in Manchester since it took over the Omega Entertainment Complex in 2007. Now, it’s no more after the owners decided to consolidate operatons at their Bedford facility. The Irish-themed restaurant and pub closed at the end of last month. Keith Murphy opened the joint after working as a manager at The Derryfield restaurant and at a restaurant in Baltimore. The taproom later expanded, and Murphy added a diner after purchasing a vacant auto mechanic’s shop. Murphy later sold the diner. Murphy, who serves as a state senator representing Manchester’s Ward 1, said it was tough to close a restaurant he invested in for 19 years. “It was a successful long run,” Murphy said. “Nineteen years is a lifetime in the restaurant business.” He said the “old saying is half of them don’t make it the first year.” He admits he doesn’t know if it’s true or not. Murphy’s owns its spot in Bedford while it rented in Manchester all these years. “When we looked at what made sense in the long term, the building that we owned made a lot more sense,” he said. The growth of new apartments in and around Manchester didn’t necessarily translate into new business, especially a place that made 50% of its profit on alcohol with trends showing people are drinking less in recent years. Pizza, burgers, and beers paid the bills. The Bedford location opened in 2017 after the team behind Murphy’s bought the Weathervane Seafood Restaurant on Route 101 in Bedford and tore it down. The venue includes a function hall. Unlike Manchester, which serves homemade bar food, Bedford has more high-end options, such as steak and seafood dishes. No changes are on the horizon for the Bedford location. “What we are doing in Bedford works very good for us,” Murphy said. “We have been busier and busier and our trendline is very good for us.” The closure of the Manchester location also made sense for Murphy’s family life. He hopes regulars will make the trek to Bedford. “For us it was a simple math equation,” Murphy said. “The place in Bedford is very busy and we’re home by 9 p.m. most nights.” jphelps@unionleader.com Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

The Slot machine is up and running again as record-equalling Liverpool sink Real,"Alexis Mac Allister's second-half header proved decisive as a revitalised Liverpool deservedly defeated Real Madrid 1-0 at Anfield to equal a Champions League record. In a closely-contested first half with chances at both ends of the field, one controversial moment stood out - one that went against the Premier League champions. The Reds were first awarded a free kick when Dominik Szoboszlai's shot struck Aurelien Tchouameni's hand right on the line, but after a pitchside review, Liverpool were not given a penalty, but the handball call itself was overturned. The home faithful would have felt that justice was served just past the hour mark, though, as one of the smallest men on the pitch - Mac Allister - beat the hitherto impenetrable Thibaut Courtois with a bullet header to break the deadlock. Arne Slot's steadfast defence quelled Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior expertly to trigger Anfield jubilation, and also equal the record for the most European Cup/Champions League wins over Real Madrid to nil with five, the same number as Juventus. Fifth-placed Real remain above Liverpool in the 36-team table, but only goal difference is keeping Los Blancos above the sixth-placed Reds, who have won back-to-back matches for the first time since September 23. We were not sure if Liverpool were back after their win over Aston Villa. Liverpool have just beaten Real Madrid, and quite convincingly at that. They are back. Tonight, the statistics and the eye test told the story on Merseyside, where the Reds generated 2.58 Expected Goals compared to Real's 0.45, and the 15-time European champions managed just two shots on target all evening long. Courtois was near-unbeatable in goal for most of the evening, but the ex-Chelsea shot-stopper was let down by his outfielders in white, and it was only too fitting for Mac Allister to grab the decisive goal and continue his redemption arc after a troubled start to the new term. Of course, the right-back dynamic cannot be ignored either; while Trent Alexander-Arnold watched on from the bench for most of the match and was then booed vociferously during his short time on the pitch, Conor Bradley had Vinicius in his pocket. Tuesday's loss was just Real's second in 15 matches this season, but Xabi Alonso's crop were inferior throughout, and the corner appears to have been well and truly turned for the Premier League holders. Was it a handball!? ? Liverpool are denied a penalty after VAR review ❌ pic.twitter.com/CLesyTkPDj What would Liverpool vs. Real Madrid be without a little bit of controversy? Referee Istvan Kovacs initially gives a free kick just outside the box for an Tchouameni handball before being summoned to the monitor, triggering cheers from expectant Liverpool fans. However, following a review, the Romanian decides that Tchouameni did not commit a handball offence after all. The home crowd thought their side were going to be awarded a penalty - they do not even get a free kick! Mac Allister breaks the deadlock! ? No saving that one for Courtois as Liverpool's pressure pays off ? pic.twitter.com/OFY3iTX2BY Courtois is beaten by a header from Mac Allister. Who had that one on their bingo card for tonight? Szoboszlai's outswinging free kick is drilled in to the mixer, and Mac Allister peels away from white shirts to steer a powerful header home into the roof of the net above Courtois's flailing arms. A VAR check briefly disrupts the hosts' celebrations, but Mac Allister is clearly being played onside by Jude Bellingham, and the goal stands. Thibaut Courtois is having a BLINDER vs Liverpool ? Where have we seen that before? ?⏮️ pic.twitter.com/Hz38Gm3gJS Picking a Real Madrid player for this award almost feels wrong, but just as he did in the 2021-22 UCL final, Courtois repelled Liverpool attack after Liverpool attack. The Belgian's efforts were in vain this time, but with eight saves, 10 recoveries, three successful run-outs and two clearances, Real Madrid would have easily lost by more were it not for one of the best goalkeepers of this generation.

Chargers’ Henley plays through grief after brother’s death,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Daiyan Henley, a former Washington State star, started and played Sunday because football is his escape, and he needed that more than ever after the shooting death of his older brother. Henley came through with seven tackles, his third sack of the season, a tackle for loss and a quarterback hit in the Chargers’ 27-20 win over the Tennessee Titans. “Right now, I’m just floating and the only thing that’s consistent right now in my life, and this is crazy to say, is football,” Henley said after the game. “So for me, that’s why I’m out there is because this is the most consistent thing I’ve got in my life right now is football. And I’m just trying to make the most of it.” His older brother, Jabari, was killed Friday night in Los Angeles. Henley traveled with the Chargers and started. According to ESPN, Henley heard the news after he was awoken Saturday morning in his hotel room by teammate Denzel Perryman, who urged him to call his mother. “Being transparent, I dropped to my knees,” Henley said. Henley was the Chargers’ third-round pick in 2023 out of WSU, and he has started every game since the start of the 2024 season. Henley’s father is record executive Eugene “Big U” Henley who has worked with many prominent West Coast rappers, including Snoop Dogg, Kurupt and the late Nipsey Hussle. The elder Henley also helped produce and was featured in the 2021 FX documentary series “Hip Hop Uncovered.” His father also is a former gang leader who was arrested in a drug sting and served 12 years of a 23-year sentence. The Chargers linebacker posted “Love you big bro” on social media after the game. It’s been a challenging year for Henley who played through illness in a 20-9 win over the Las Vegas Raiders in the second game of the season. He said the Chargers’ organization has been there for him from ownership on down, and Henley credited coach Jim Harbaugh with being there for him repeatedly. “He’s probably been the first call I’ve gotten for every situation,” Henley said. “He’s been there, right there and just told me, keep my head down, keep grinding, keep working, and try to stay consistent.”",2025-11-05 08:05:00,Dnews,positive,0.7436,0,Loss_After_Career," Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Daiyan Henley started and played Sunday in 27-20 win over Tennessee Titans .

Frank Dunn,"Birth: 1936 Death: 2025 Frank Wyatt Dunn, a man whose hands shaped more than just tools and machines, passed away peacefully on October 25, 2025, at the age of 89. His life was defined not only by what he built, but by how he built it–with care, integrity, and a deep sense of purpose. Born on February 18, 1936, Frank was a natural builder. He could make, repair, and maintain almost anything–from farm equipment to household fixtures. But his true gift lay in constructing the foundations of lasting relationships, thriving businesses, and community organizations. His work was never just about the task at hand–it was about the people it served and the legacy it left behind. Frank spent forty years as the general manager of a leading agronomy research facility, where he oversaw pioneering efforts in selective breeding to improve crop resilience and yield. His leadership helped advance sustainable agriculture and supported generations of farmers and scientists. Though he once patented a clover harvester in 1978, a testament to his ingenuity, Frank’s life’s work was far broader. He was a lifelong member and leader of the Lions Club, where he served with distinction, including as District Governor in 1991. His service was marked by humility and a tireless commitment to helping others. Frank shared over 64 joyful years of marriage with his beloved wife, Marilee Dunn, who passed just six months before him. Their partnership was the cornerstone of a life filled with love, laughter, and shared purpose. He is survived by his two sons, Mike and David; his daughter-in-law Cathy; his grandsons Ryan and Will; and Ryan’s wife, Jessa. Frank was eagerly awaiting the arrival of his first great-grandchild this coming February–a new life he hoped to welcome with the same warmth and wisdom he gave so freely. A celebration of Frank’s life will be held on Tuesday, November 25 at 12:00 PM at the Woodland Lion Banquet Hall. All who knew him are invited to gather and honor the man who built so much and gave even more. Frank led by example, touching and changing the lives of everyone he encountered.

Limp Bizkit bassist Sam Rivers was found dead in pool of blood: report,"Late Limp Bizkit bassist Sam Rivers was found dead in a blood-stained bathroom earlier last month, according to a new report on Oct 30. Photo: TNS Late Limp Bizkit bassist Sam Rivers was found dead in a blood-stained bathroom earlier last month, according to a new report on Oct 30. Per a recording of the 911 call obtained by TMZ, a woman identified only as Keely told a dispatcher she discovered Rivers “face first in a pile of blood” in a bathroom at his Florida home. She can be heard attempting to perform CPR during the call as she sobs into the phone. Responding officers from the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Department also performed CPR before paramedics arrived and pronounced Rivers dead. The 48-year-old musician appeared to have a cut above his eye, suggesting he may have suffered a fall, according to an incident report also obtained by TMZ. A deputy noted Rivers’ face and neck were blue – common symptoms of a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot that blocks and stops blood flow to the lungs. However, his cause of death has still not been determined. It was previously reported that Rivers was under medical care at home at the time of his death. According to the incident report, Keely told deputies that Rivers underwent a liver transplant in 2018 and was taking related medication. He temporarily left Limp Bizkit in 2015 after developing liver disease from years of excessive drinking. “I had to leave Limp Bizkit in 2015 because I felt so horrible, and a few months after that I realised I had to change everything because I had really bad liver disease,” Rivers told author Jon Wiederhorn for his book Raising Hell. “I got treatment for the alcohol and got a liver transplant, which was a perfect match,” he said. He returned to the band in 2018, the same year as his transplant. Rivers co-founded Limp Bizkit in the 1990s alongside frontman Fred Durst. Several of the band’s songs have seen a recent surge in streams, including 1999’s Break Stuff, which topped Billboard’s Hot Hard Rock Songs list just this week. As of Oct 30, Limp Bizkit was still slated to embark on their Central and South American Gringo Papi tour, kicking off Nov 29 in Mexico City. The seven-date, seven-country tour is scheduled to end Dec 20 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. – New York Daily News/Tribune News Service Thank you for your report!",2025-11-05 08:05:00,The Star,negative,0.5876,-1,Outlier," Sam Rivers was found dead in a blood-stained bathroom at his Florida home .

These steps further position Point’s securitization platform to meet the standards of European and UK institutional investors, reflecting Point’s commitment to broadening global access to the HEI market. “Building on the strong momentum of PNT 25-1, this transaction reflects growing confidence in home equity investments as a mainstream asset class,” said Eddie Lim, co-founder and CEO of Point. “As homeowners and investors continue to seek flexible, sustainable ways to unlock and deploy capital, Point is proud to lead with consistency, transparency, and execution.” Since pioneering the HEI category in 2015, Point has closed six securitizations and continues to set benchmarks for liquidity, scalability, and transparency in alternative home equity financing. “This marks the third transaction that Blue Owl has co-sponsored alongside Point.

Ellen Murdoch Wheeler,"Birth: 1930 Death: 2025 Ellen Murdoch Wheeler entered into eternal rest on Tuesday, October 28th, 2025 in Portage, Indiana. She is survived by her children, Ellen Ann Lopiano, Janet M. Wheeler, and Scott M. Wheeler; 15 grandchildren, 22 great-grandchildren, and 2 great-great-great-grandchildren. She was preceded in death by her beloved husband of 49 years, Arthur J. Wheeler, and two sons, Stephen A. Wheeler and Mark E. Wheeler. Born to Scottish immigrant parents, Archibald and Margaret B. Murdoch of Warwick, Rhode Island, she was the youngest of five. She aspired to become a seamstress and was a part-time secretary at Brown University. This changed when she met her husband, Arthur, a volunteer fireman and eventual sheet metal worker. The couple were wed in the living room of Ellen’s childhood home on July 2nd, 1949. After starting their family, they moved to Orange County, California. Ellen embraced life as a homemaker, mother, and devout Christian. Later, Ellen joined the ranks of the Yorba Linda mail carriers as one of their first female mailmen. After retirement, the couple moved to Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Sadly, Arthur passed in 1998. Ellen chose to remain for three decades in Lake Havasu and was involved at St. Michael’s United Methodist Church. During this time, she also cared for her sister Janet Fisher and her adult son Stephen, both passed from dementia. She then moved to be with family, living briefly in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, before settling in Indiana with her daughter, Janet, and grandson Frank Spennato. Reading and cryptograms were Ellen’s favorite pass times. She could buy out a bookstore. Ellen also continued to sew and knit. Her children and grandchildren could often be found wearing the latest Ellen fashion. Ellen was known as a spitfire, a straight shooter, and perhaps a little mischievous. She’d be the first to say she was no saint. But one thing was certain, everyone held deep respect for her. Above all, she was known for her love, because when she loved, she loved fiercely. A public memorial service will be held on Saturday, November 22nd at 2:00pm at St. Michael’s United Methodist Church in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. All are welcome. There will be a reception to follow in the church hall, and flowers are appreciated. Please RSVP to ellenwheelermemorial@gmail.com if you plan to attend by November 15th.

Rock legend Jim Messina to play solo show at Flying Monkey,"PLYMOUTH — Rock 'n' roll legend Jim Messina has been on the cover of the Rolling Stone, played with the likes of Neil Young and Stephen Stills in Buffalo Springfield, and formed one of the top duos of the 1970s with Loggins and Messina.

Messina will be joined by his band The Roadrunners on Thursday, Nov. 20, for an intimate show at the Flying Monkey Movie House & Performance Center, where he will play some brand-new material, as well as old favorites from his days with some of rock’s most influential groups. “I will be 78 on my next birthday, and when I look at when I started at 13, and where I am now, I think the greatest achievement is to maintain and continue working and making people happy who hear my music,” Messina said. “I never expected it.” Messina is a student of music, saying he is often up late educating himself on the ins and outs of production, and what makes certain sounds even possible. Recently, he was awake at 1 a.m., trying to understand power transformers and how to produce 300 volts. He is building his first guitar amplifier, saying he still studies, and figured, why not? Backtrack more than seven decades, and you’ll find the start of Messina’s musical career. He started playing the guitar when he was 5 years old, but it wasn’t until junior high school when he was buying singles and listening to The Champs, and things started to click. After playing a couple shows with neighborhood friends, with one essentially being a babysitting gig at a local country club, he formed a group called His Jesters, his first shot at success. At only 16, Messina was already making a name for himself as a lead guitarist. But he was also multi-talented, and desired for his production skills. He apprenticed under renowned audio engineer Mike Dorrough at the Bob Hudson-owned Emperor Productions in southern California, and suddenly he was learning how to produce, and worked with acclaimed drummer Earl Palmer and bassist Joe Osborne. “These guys were so good,” Messina said. “I thought, they could read music like it was fly paper.” He and Dorrough partnered to start building studios around Hollywood, and down the line was recommended for engineering gigs at places like Sunset Sound. One day, his manager asked if he was available for a demo. Messina showed up the next morning, set up a microphone, and, wanting ambiance, he moved in a lava lamp. The lights went down, and a singer/songwriter came in. It was the first time he ever had visuals from the music being sung. That singer was Joni Mitchell, and her work was being produced by none other than David Crosby, who ultimately went to Neil Young to tell him about this producer working at Sunset Sound who could help him with a new project: Buffalo Springfield. “I was the engineer for their second album, and the third album I was asked to produce the band, and I got the job,” he said. When Buffalo Springfield lost their bass player, the band held auditions, and Messina decided to give it a shot, despite mainly being a guitarist. He had already received some pointers from Osborne while building his studio, and he said the tricks he was shown worked, because Young was impressed by what he heard. “There were 13 of us, and I was the last one. And I got about eight bars in, and I got a look from Neil,” he said. “It was like, 'Whoa, this guy knows the songs.' Why wouldn’t I know them?” Messina said Buffalo Springfield “were great cats, but sometimes like herding cats.” These were budding rock stars, with Young and Stephen Stills on their way to being some of the most successful around. After Buffalo Springfield disbanded, Messina and guitarist Richie Furay decided to form the band Poco, which really started in 1967, while Buffalo Springfield was still around, playing the Furay-penned song “Kind Woman.” Poco was short lived, from 1968 until Halloween of 1970, but this opened the door for perhaps Messina's greatest successful venture. “I had just left Poco, and had conversations with people at CBS about [Kenny] Loggins, who they were considering signing,” Messina said. “Kenny and I met before Christmas, and made that decision to start working together at the beginning of 1971.” Messina said he interviewed Loggins, and discovered he didn’t even own a guitar, and showed up without any tapes of his material. He knew Loggins had talent, but there was some work to be done. They started tinkering with what would become a couple of their biggest hits, “Danny’s Song” and “House on Pooh Corner,” and despite not being much of a rock 'n' roll repertoire, Messina saw something special in Loggins. “I believed in Kenny because of his voice,” Messina said. “He had this ability to sing other styles of music, because he loved them so much.” Messina called music producer Clive Davis, sent him some tapes, and while he liked what he heard, noticed Messina was doing a lot of the playing. Messina was tired of touring and had no intention of hitting the road, but Davis questioned who would take his place. “I figured I would help support his first tour and show him the ropes, see how things went, and I would jump off after the first tour, when he was established,” Messina said. “Clive didn’t like that idea.” Davis said too many great bands get together and break up after the first album, but in this case, he decided Messina could just sit in. The idea was to bring Loggins out first for acoustic, followed by Messina playing some country rock, then the two joining forces. The debut album, Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina “Sittin’ In,” was an instant success, and after some back and forth on a name for the duo, they went with Loggins and Messina. “Suddenly, Loggins and Messina became one of the best selling duos at that time,” Messina said. Loggins and Messina was a force between 1971 and 1976, selling more than 16 million records, with huge hits led by “Your Mama Don’t Dance,” which reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Now years later, Messina recalls times many could not even dream of. He played at storied venues like Carnegie Hall, Madison Square Garden, and Jones Beach, and said when he looks back at some of these moments, it was like he didn’t realize it was happening, as it was a whirlwind. But his greatest achievement of all was starting to play music as a teenager, and still putting out new material at age 78. “I still feel very inspired every day when I get up,” Messina said. “I have been able to maintain that interest in what I do. When I was 11 or 12, I said I wanted to know this business from the register up to the legalese. This has been what my life has been.” Fans at the Flying Monkey will be able to hear material off his new album “Here, There and Everywhere,” which he released with his new band The Roadrunners. But there will be plenty from his days putting out legendary songs with equally legendary artists. “What I work to do is make sure we have songs and arrangements that people have heard and enjoyed over their lifetime, and keep those arrangements to sound as close to the original as possible,” he said. “I believe that is important.” Log In Keep it Clean.

"Debating 2026 Yankees with big changes ... maybe Steven Kwan, Robert Suarez","The World Series is over and it’s hot stove time. First up are the GM meetings, which will be held in Las Vegas next week. It’s very early into the offseason, but we do know the Yankees have roster holes to fill with nine free agents counting Cody Bellinger, who has already opted out of his deal. The Bombers need a center fielder with Trent Grisham and Bellinger on the market. Will they make sure one of them returns? Will they lose both, choose not to spend aggressively and raise the curtain on prospect Spencer Jones after a 35-homer, 25-steal season in the minors? The Yankees also need relievers. Devin Williams and Luke Weaver, both free agents, have one foot out the door. Bench players are on the shopping list, too. What should the Yankees do? This is the subject of the latest Yankees roundtable with beat writer Randy Miller and baseball columnist Bob Klapisch: Klapisch: This is the time of the year that I’m convinced fans love most. It feels like the temperature of the Hot Stove has been climbing steadily, season after season. It starts with the GM Meetings. The interesting part is that nothing actually gets done at these meetings. They are entirely preliminary. Brian Cashman, for example, won’t be proposing trades. What he does is have generic, abstract discussions with the GMs that he gets along with best, the GMs that he knows will be honest with him. He’ll say, ‘Hey, what are you looking for? Here’s what I need. Why don’t you think about A, B and C and I’ll see if I can match up with what you’re after. Let’s stay in touch.’ That’s how it usually goes in early November. That’s when the clock starts ticking. The Winter Meetings in December is when it all starts to become real. But next week, it’s just touching base, seeing who’s out there, and who’s prepared to move aggressively. Miller: Outfield has to be the Yankees’ biggest need. I know they think Jones is ready, but his strikeout rate was 35.4 percent this year and 36.8 percent in 2024. Both were higher than Yankees third baseman Ryan McMahon’s MLB-high 32.3 rate this past season. Can the Yankees go into next season with Jones in center and Jasson Dominguez in left? I doubt it. What I would do is try to bring back Bellinger to play center or try to make a trade with the Guardians for Steven Kwan to play left. Kwan is probably attainable because he’s two years away from free agency and projected to make $8.8 million next season. The Guardians don’t pay anyone other than Jose Raminez, so Kwan probably gets moved. If the Yankees get Kwan, Dominguez or Jones probably goes to Cleveland and the other starts in center. Kwan would be a great Yankees fit. He’d give them a true leadoff hitter to bat in front of Aaron Judge. He’s also won four Gold Gloves in the last four years. Klapisch: I’ve been told by people familiar with Cashman’s thinking that the Yankees are ready to commit to Jones if Bellinger doesn’t come back. Jones strikes out a lot, but that’s not a deal breaker. The Yankees have seen progression in other areas. Obviously he has the power. He has the size. He has the defensive skill. He has the charisma and personality for New York. He checks so many boxes that I strongly suspect he’ll be plan B if Bellinger walks. Miller: What’s unknown is whether the Yankees will pay the market rate to keep Bellinger. They love him, but they’re also are very high on Dominguez and Jones. They think both can be stars. They also need some lower-payroll players to balance out all of their many big-salary stars. Klapisch: I believe Bellinger will sign with another club and so do a lot of people around the around the big leagues. Remember, he’s represented by Scott Boras. We know what that means. Miller: I’m hearing Bellinger could get $180 million for six years, maybe more than $200 million for seven. If the Yankees make that kind of commitment, there is no spot for Jones or Dominguez. But I don’t think Bellinger is back unless it’s a team-friendly contract in years, and that’s not happening. Boras will make sure of that. Klapisch: People hire Boras for one reason only, and that’s to make the last-possible dollar regardless of what uniform you end up wearing. So just keep that in mind. The Yankees learned their lesson from their pursuit of Juan Soto last year. They thought they made a great offer, only to be outbid at the last minute by Steve Cohen and the Mets. My sense is that Yankees are wary of Boras using the same playbook with Bellinger: use Hal Steinbrenner to jack up the price and move him elsewhere. I don’t think the Yankees want to be party to that for a second year in a row. Miller: Would you consider packaging Dominguez or Jones for Kwan? I would. To me, Kwan is another Brett Gardner, maybe even a little better. Just look at Kwan’s stats for the last two years, .292 with 14 homers and 12 steals in 2024, .272 with 11 homers and 21 steals in 2025. The Yankees scored the most runs in the majors last season and could be a better offense next year with a lineup starting with Kwan, Judge and Ben Rice, then Giancarlo Stanton, Jazz Chisholm and Dominguez or Jones hitting fourth through sixth. Klapisch: I would try to get Kwan. I have a lot of enthusiasm for Dominguez’s upside. I still think he’s going to have a good career, but I don’t think necessarily it’s going to happen in New York. He probably would be a very good player for the Guardians. The Yankees need contact hitters like Kwan. They need hitters who don’t just put the ball in play, but ones who will frustrate pitchers and drive up their pitch counts … foul ball, foul ball, foul ball. That’s how the Blue Jays ended the Yankees’ season. The Yankees need a lineup that bears some resemblance to Toronto’s. Kwan fits that profile. Miller: Let’s move on to the bullpen. Their best high-leverage arms are the two closers they acquired last summer, David Bednar and Camilo Doval. That’s not enough. The way baseball is now, you really have to load up on bullpen arms because starters are often pulled in the fifth and sixth innings. What I’d do is make a big play for Robert Suarez, who is opting out of the final two years of his Padres contract after leading the NL with 40 saves this year. Mets closer Edwin Diaz also is opting out, but his price will higher, probably $20 million a year minimum. The Yankees won’t play that. Suarez turns 35 on March 1, so he’ll come a lot cheaper than Diaz, who will be 32 in March. Klapisch: It won’t cost a lot of money to reinvest in Weaver. I’d roll the dice on him again, but I am concerned about the trendline. His ERA in September was almost 10, and as you saw in the playoffs, he literally couldn’t get anybody out. Scouts have told me he was tipping pitches. The Yankees themselves said he was tipping pitches, and they were actually upset that he didn’t take that warning to heart. He was doing it all year, and didn’t do enough to clean up his delivery. Gerrit Cole worked with Weaver, but not even the counsel of a future Hall of Famer corrected the problem. It all reached a crescendo in October. Scouts also have told me that Weaver subtly changed his mechanics after his hamstring injury. He only missed three weeks, but never was quite the same. His velocity was down and the life on his fastball that he had in 2024 was gone. It’s fair to ask if that signature four-seamer is ever coming back. Miller: That’s a concern. Klapisch: It is a concern because pitchers usually start on the downward trend in their late 20s, especially power pitchers like Weaver. Once the decline begins, it only accelerates from there. But if I’m the GM, I still might try to bring Weaver back because he’s not going to cost a lot of money. He’s going to be a heck of a lot less than it would cost to sign Diaz, the best reliever available, I predict Diaz is going back to the Mets. I’d go for Suarez, too. You might be able to get him for half of Diaz’s price. Miller: I’m not so sure Weaver is going to be a cheap re-sign. I’m hearing he could get three years and $27-to-30 million. I think I’d pass at that price. Here’s another relief option that I like, a trade option. The Rays probably will be looking to move closer Pete Fairbanks, who’s got a club option for $11 million. Look for the Rays to pick up the option, then make a trade. I like Fairbanks. He’s pitched a lot of big games for some good Rays teams that made the playoffs. Klapisch: Fairbanks has been tormenting the Yankees for years, so it’s obvious he’s capable of pitching under pressure and in the New York spotlight. That’s the mistake the Yankees made with Devin Williams, who didn’t quite have the temperament for this market. So for sure Williams is out. It just goes to show that good relief pitchers who look tempting from afar don’t always work out. But I agree Fairbanks would be a great pickup. I would make that move. Miller: The Yankees need to get a right-handed hitting catcher, too. They had three lefties last year — Austin Wells, J.C. Escarra and Rice. I don’t think Rice is a catcher. He had no starts there in the playoffs because Wells is so much better receiving. Put Rice on first base every day. He might hit his way to the All-Star Game next summer and he might also improve from below average to average defensively concentrating on one position. Klapisch: So who are you looking at in terms of a right-handed hitting catcher? A-Rod was particularly critical of the Yankees on this very point. Miller: J.T. Realmuto would fill that need, but it’s doubtful the Yankees would go for him. I think more likely options are two other free agents, Danny Jansen and Christian Vazquez. Another possibility is Twins catcher Ryan Jeffers, who could be moved this winter. Jeffers’ power is intriguing and he feasts on left-handed pitching, but he does not have a great arm, is not a great blocker, nor is an accomplished framer. I like Vasquez. His average over the last three seasons is just .215, but he could be really good for the Yankees’ pitching staff and an excellent mentor to Wells. Klapisch: The potential hunt for another catcher is fueled by the disappointment with Wells’ lack of development. I thought he was going to be a much better hitter than he was this season. By the end of the year it felt like he’d become a near-automatic out. I still think there’s unrealized potential there, and I bet the Yankees could live with Wells if they woke up Anthony Volpe and Ryan McMahon at the bottom of the order. Those three - Wells, Volpe and McMahon - were like a black hole. I’m not sure bringing in a right-handed catcher is a must if you can rachet up the production elsewhere in that lineup. Miller: Moving on, the Yankees also have to redo their bench. As of now, Jose Caballero is their top extra player and he’s probably going to begin the season as the starting shortstop with Volpe out for the first month or so. They’ll also have Oswaldo Cabrera, who’s coming back from his broken leg. Klapisch: If we’re talking about changes, then the Yankees have to wean themselves off their home run addiction. That culture works for superstars like for Judge, Bellinger and Stanton, but it also undermines other hitters in that lineup, specifically Volpe. The Yankees absolutely have to go back to a contact-first philosophy. The Blue Jays did that in the Division Series. If the Yankees didn’t learn a lesson from that, then I don’t know what their future is. There has to be a change in the way they score runs and the way they attack opposing pitchers. Miller: I agree, but I don’t see the Yankees’ culture changing unless they make some drastic move. You want to upend the culture? Bring in Kwan. Trade McMahon and Chisholm for other strong defensive infielders who put the ball in play more. I know it’s unlikely, but a couple blockbusters is what the Yankees might need to finally win another World Series.

Where is Kanye West? Inside mystery of rapper's disappearance,"Kanye West, a name once dominated headlines and social media feeds, has been vanished for months. Where is he? Earlier this year, he stormed X (formerly Twitter) with his unfiltered thoughts, made a controversial red carpet appearance with wife Bianca Censori, and dropped some new songs. Every word he said became a headline but lately there’s been nothing. No new music, no paparazzi sightings, no cryptic posts instead just an eerie silence from him. According to fans’ wild theories the rapper, who now goes by the name Ye, has either retreated into complete isolation, working in secret or building a new creative empire or he’s just simply done, burned out or finally choosing silence after years of chaos? One thing is certain, the 24-Grammys winner knows how to stay in the headlines and might love being the center of attention so his absence feels deliberate. How can the man who once fed on the energy of public attention now seem to be starving the world of his presence? Although Censori, with whom Ye got married in 2022, has been back in the spotlight promoting her new fashion line, the Yeezy founder is still nowhere to be seen. She made her Instagram comeback in October after a few-month hiatus and was recently spotted out and about. Ye, who’s no stranger to doing anything to stay trending, might have stepped back from the spotlight to amplify the yearning and reach for his upcoming music release. Considering the pre-release chaos of his previous albums including Yeezus and Donda, it wouldn’t be the first time he would turn mystery into marketing. The 48-year-old record producer and fashion designer's album rollouts have always carried an element of chaos, secret sessions, leaks and cryptic teasers. So far his social media accounts have been dead, with his last Instagram post dating back to July 1. A post shared by Ye (@ye) Maybe this isn’t a disappearance but the calm before Atlanta-born artist's next cultural storm because in his world, silence often means something is brewing. While nothing through official channels have been communicated Ye did drop a tiny yet gravely upsetting update. Despite hearing nothing from him recently, fans were counting down to the release of Bully on November 7, only for the Runaway singer to disappoint them with his move. Ye quietly pushed back Bully release date, which he first teased in late 2024, to December 12. Notably, his 12th solo studio album, which is his first after the 2022 Donda 2, has been delayed five times. The Heartless singer had first claimed that the album would come out on June 15, the birthday of his and ex wife Kim Kardashian’s daughter North West. However, it wasn't released then, and there was no official word either. He then released a few tracks on June 20, including Preacher Man, Beauty and the Beast, and DAMN. The Stronger hitmaker then released two more singles on July 4, which were Last Breath and Losing Your Mind and hinted at a July 25 release for the album, but it was delayed again. He then pushed the release date to September before Spotify started a countdown until November 7. However, the release has been pushed to December 12 now, as per the updated date on spotify The delay has only deepened the mystery that either he is perfecting the project, or is this another round of unpredictable Ye chaos? Whether it’s a strategy or simply chaos disguised as art, the world is once again waiting for Ye to break his silence and when he does, the noise will be impossible to ignore.",2025-11-05 20:07:00,The News International,negative,0.5024,5,Estate_Million_To," Kanye West, a name once dominated headlines and social media feeds, has been vanished for months .

Cops poised for firework disorder as officers watch over Bonfire Night displays,"Police are poised for any potential firework disorder in Edinburgh this evening with officers seen keeping a careful watch over displays in the capital. Cops in the city have been given additional powers to stop and search people and vehicles as they aim to tackle the widespread Bonfire Night disorder seen in previous years. On Wednesday night, as the festivities got into full swing, uniformed officers were seen watching on from street corners as fireworks were set off. While no early trouble had been reported in the area, police vans have been seen situated on streets throughout the city. Earlier we told how the force have implemented Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which also allows for the removal of any items believed to be used to conceal a person's identity. The powers same in from 3pm on November 5 and will be in place within the Niddrie, Muirhouse, Pilton, Moredun, Gracemount, Saughton, Sighthill and Longstone areas of the city. Police say that this will be used ""responsibly"" and only ""when justified to help prevent disorder and serious violence"". It comes after police promised a record level of resources to tackle Bonfire Night disorder. In 2023, some 62 police officers were injured in disorder around the fireworks season across Scotland. Edinburgh has been the centre of shocking scenes of carnage in recent years around Bonfire night with locals left terrified by masked youths running riot. Dispersal zones are now enforceable to help prevent anti-social behaviour and keep communities safe from October 31 to November 5 from 2pm to midnight every day, with officers given powers to take action where needed. The zones cover multiple parts of the city from north to south and east to west. Overall, fireworks offences have reduced, but an increased targeting of emergency services has prompted cops to promise a tougher crackdown this year. Frontline officers in Edinburgh will also be equipped with Body Worn Video, as the national roll-out of this technology continues in a bid to track down offenders.

Dear Abby: In-laws’ habit of ‘popping over’ unannounced isn’t going over well,"DEAR ABBY: My husband and I are celebrating our second anniversary. For the most part, we’re very happy. He’s the best friend I’ve ever had. The problem is his family. They’re wonderful people who have welcomed me with open arms. But they are also extremely clingy and lack common boundaries. We recently moved to a larger home that’s closer to them but farther from my family. Now that we live closer, they constantly pop in unannounced for visits at inconvenient times, such as while I’m getting dinner plated up. His mother has been told numerous times that we are private people and don’t like a lot of company, but she still keeps doing the same thing. She’s also trying to throw parties at our house and talking about putting in a pool, even though we have told her no repeatedly. And, Abby, when one family member shows up, you can almost guarantee that two or three more will show up soon after. When we moved in, my family came to see the house. They had been here no more than five minutes when his entire family -- aunts, cousins, everyone -- showed up and took over! Consequently, my family didn’t really get to visit or even see the house because things got too chaotic. Please help. -- LOSING IT IN ALABAMA DEAR LOSING IT: When you married into your husband’s family, they welcomed you as one of their own. If I read your letter correctly, they view you as a family member, and your family as blended into their own.

Alabama sends Arkansas volleyball to 11th straight loss,"FAYETTEVLLE -- University of Arkansas volleyball Coach Jason Watson said his team was playing better recently, but the Razorbacks weren't able to sustain that in a 3-1 loss (25-16, 25-22, 16-25, 25-14) to Alabama on Wednesday night at Barnhill Arena. Arkansas (5-18, 1-11 SEC) dropped its 11th consecutive match. ""I did (feel like they were playing better) coming out of Oklahoma,"" Watson said. ""Tonight. I'm not sure where we were at. The inability to stay on task for long periods of time ... we give up big runs of points and just some strange things. It's been a long season and I get that, but you've still got a job to do and that job is to go play volleyball."" Alabama bounced back after dropping the third set, breaking from an 8-8 tie. The Crimson Tide put together an 8-1 run to take control. Jada Lawson's kill pulled Arkansas within 16-11, but the Razorbacks got no closer as Alabama pulled away to close out the match. Alabama Coach Rashinda Reed said her team has had plenty of experience of trying to come back when the opposition takes a set. ""We've actually had a lot of practice at these moments,"" Reed said with a laugh. ""These are things we are actually working on with our team. It was all about staying steady and relentless, and they did a really nice job of doing that. I was really proud of them in the mental side and the ability to execute within our system. ""Arkansas is a very good team. They are coached well, good defensive team. Our understanding was we just had to keep going."" The Crimson Tide (12-11, 4-9) snapped their three-match skid. The Razorbacks haven't won since defeating Ole Miss in five sets on Sept. 26. Victoria Barrett finished with a match-high 17 kills to go with 17 digs for Alabama, while Palmer and Agee added 13 and 11 kills, respectively. Trinity Stanger also added a match-high 19 digs. Parker Duncan led Arkansas with 14 kills to go with 10 digs and hit .375. Lawson added nine kills, while setter Kiki Remensperger added 18 assists and 16 digs. Romani Thurman also contributed a match-high six blocks. Arkansas faces Mississippi State in its final home match of the season Friday at 7 p..m.

The FIFO CEO: Rail Loop boss commutes from Queensland,"Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. The $900,000-a-year executive responsible for Melbourne’s most expensive infrastructure project commutes from Brisbane and is paid additional expenses to attend unscheduled meetings. Freedom of information documents released to The Age reveal the extraordinary arrangements to enable Suburban Rail Loop Authority chief executive Frankie Carroll to maintain a residence in Brisbane, fly in and out of his Big Build job, and bill taxpayers for flight costs when he is “recalled to duty”. Suburban Rail Loop Authority chief executive Frankie Carroll. This is an employment term used when staff are asked to work or return to the office outside their regular work hours. Carroll, who is on a remuneration package of between $900,000 and $909,999, has led the Allan government’s signature infrastructure project since 2021. This includes superannuation and accrued leave and other entitlements. While Carroll meets the cost of his regular commute himself, the documents show that taxpayers were charged when Carroll flew to Melbourne, where the rail loop authority is headquartered, to attend a conference. In another example of travel costs billed to taxpayers, a flight from Brisbane to Melbourne is attributed to a “meeting in Canberra” but no further detail is provided. The released documents show that since Carroll was headhunted to run the SRLA, he has taken more than 30 domestic flights funded by taxpayers. The flights suggest he divides his time evenly between Victoria and Queensland and sometimes flies directly to Sydney or Canberra from Brisbane for meetings and conferences. The value of the flights attributed to Carroll being “recalled to duty” is $3645 since 2021. Carroll’s decision to remain embedded in Brisbane has raised eyebrows internally given the importance of the rail loop as Victoria’s biggest infrastructure project. The Age has spoken to four government sources, speaking anonymously to avoid repercussions, who said it was widely known within the SRLA that Carroll spent a significant share of his time in Queensland. “He has mentioned to stakeholders in meetings that he is FIFO [fly-in, fly-out],” one said. Opposition major projects spokesman Matthew Guy said the situation was farcical. “The Suburban Rail Loop is just another example of the Big Build becoming Victorian taxpayers’ big bill,” he said. Touted by the Allan government as Australia’s largest housing project, the Suburban Rail Loop has been billed as a generational city-shaping venture vital to maintaining Melbourne’s liveability as it is estimated to become a city of about 9 million people in the 2050s. The first stage of the loop, SRL East, is an underground railway between Cheltenham and Box Hill and is expected to cost $34.5 billion. The north and west links, if built, would connect to Melbourne’s existing rail lines in a so-called hub and spoke system. Precincts above each station have been flagged as mini-CBDs in the suburbs, transformed into denser hubs for jobs, homes and educational facilities. Plans for the first six of these precincts are being assessed by a planning panel, and some areas have been slated for towers as high as 25 storeys. Infrastructure Australia has questioned the $34.5 billion estimated price tag and recommended new analysis, including an updated cost-to-benefit ratio. More than $20 billion of this figure remains unfunded, with Victoria committing to fund a third on its own, another third through charges on development and the final third from the Commonwealth. The Albanese government has pledged $2.2 billion so far. Infrastructure Australia has recommended against further commitments without more information on the project’s cost and the charges the state plans to use to pay for the loop. The SRLA’s latest report shows the chief executive’s salary rose from a range between $870,000 and $879,999 in the 2023-24 financial year to between $900,000 and $909,999 in 2024-25, roughly in line with inflation. Travel records show the rail loop authority has spent tens of thousands of dollars flying Carroll to Asia and Europe to woo companies to bid for work on the project. Trips to Dublin, Rome, Seoul, Paris and London, among others, were taken to ensure a “competitive market process”, the documents say, for the early stages of bidding for the SRL East project, which has been broken into multiple packages. These visits had the effect of “ultimately achieving value for money and best project outcomes”. All four international journeys began with flights from Brisbane. Carroll’s most extensive trip was in 2022, when he spoke to potential bidders for one of the largest SRL East contracts on offer, a “line-wide” package that is estimated to be worth at least $8 billion to $9 billion. He travelled to Singapore, South Korea, Ireland, Spain, Austria, France and Britain. He returned to Europe a year later to meet other companies that were “unable to accommodate meetings in late 2022’s compressed schedule”. TransitLinX – a group of companies comprising John Holland, RATP Dev, Alstom, KBR and WSP – is the preferred bidder for this contract, which involves building the trains used on the underground line, operating and maintaining the network, and fitting out the tunnels. More recently, Carroll travelled to London and Dublin to talk to global insurance agencies to discuss coverage for the project. A Suburban Rail Loop Authority spokesperson said: “The Suburban Rail Loop will slash travel times and cut congestion for busy families – while delivering 70,000 more homes within walking distance to jobs, healthcare, green open spaces and Australia’s largest universities. “Mr Carroll’s primary residence is in Melbourne, and he travels on the weekends to see his family at his own expense. “As we get on delivering one of Victoria’s largest and most complex infrastructure project, engaging directly with leading global construction companies, suppliers and operators is essential to secure the specialist expertise required to build this city-shaping project.” Carroll, originally from Ireland, moved to Brisbane in 2004 and has held a range of high-level government roles, including chief executive of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority and director-general for the state’s Department of Infrastructure, Local Government and Planning. He became Queensland’s under treasurer in 2019 but moved out of the job in 2020 following the resignation of the state’s former deputy premier Jackie Trad and allegations she had interfered in his appointment. A Crime and Corruption Commission report into the hiring released this year made no adverse findings against Carroll but was critical of Trad’s “aggressive” advocacy that he be appointed. She has rejected the accusations in the report and no prosecutions were ever made over the saga.

France extradites Belarusian woman to US over suspected aircraft parts shipments to Russia,"Yana Leonova, a 33-year-old Belarusian national, has been extradited from France to the US on charges of plotting to violate the Export Control Reform Act, to commit smuggling, to commit money laundering and to defraud the United States. Source: US Department of Justice in a press release, as reported by European Pravda Details: According to the indictment, in May 2022, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Leonova – using accomplices based in the US – purchased and unlawfully exported numerous avionics and other aircraft equipment from the United States to Russia. The press release said the exported goods were intended for use on private aircraft operated by Leonova's former employer, a company listed among the entities restricted by the US Department of Commerce. Investigators established that Leonova and her associates had purchased aviation components from US-based distributors. Using companies registered in Armenia, the Maldives and other countries, they subsequently transferred the components to Russia without the required export licences from the US Department of Commerce. ""This defendant tried to circumvent US law to enrich herself by procuring and illicitly exporting, from the United States to Russia, avionics and other prohibited equipment,"" said US Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro. Leonova and her associates repeatedly concealed and misrepresented the true end users and final destinations of the aviation components. She also arranged for goods to be sent to Russia via intermediary destinations and facilitated US-dollar transfers from foreign bank accounts to American ones.

Homegrown Lewis grateful to lead Moscow,"The new mayor of Moscow is excited to serve the city that has served her throughout her life. Hailey Lewis, a lifelong Moscow resident, celebrated her victory Tuesday night after defeating Alex Simon at the polls. She will replace retiring Moscow mayor Art Bettge in January. “I’m just so over the moon,” she said Wednesday. She said Moscow is a community that has given her many opportunities and she appreciates being able to give back through public service. Lewis is grateful that Moscow “believed in me the same way that I believe in Moscow.” Growing up, Lewis attended Lena Whitmore Elementary School, Moscow Junior High School, and served as Associated Student Body president at Moscow High School. She works at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories and has been on the Moscow City Council since 2021. She will be joined by three new city councilors: Evan Holmes, Sage McCetich and Scott Sumner also won their elections Tuesday. Incumbent Gina Taruscio came in fourth place in the race. Based on her time on city council, Lewis said the city does a good job with onboarding new councilors. All three of the candidates have also served on Moscow citizen commissions before. Lewis said she hopes to help foster a “cohesive team rowing in the same direction” toward the city’s goals. She also hopes to use her new position to help teach the public about the city’s process and the issues facing Moscow. Lewis thanked the community for voting and noted the high turnout for a nonpresidential election. Latah County Auditor Julie Fry was also impressed by the 42% voter turnout, which far surpassed the 27% turnout during the last “off-year” election in 2023. “Voters were engaged,” Fry said. Fry said her staff knew this election was going to have higher participation based on the amount of early voters, which totaled 2,289 people. Fry said she will contact the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office to discuss two tight races that may require a recount. One Juliaetta City Council election featured two candidates separated by one vote. Richard Tackett has 76 votes and Amanda Fletcher has 75, based on early results. Rick Lawless has the most votes with 81. There are two city council seats available in that race. The Moscow Cemetery District race was close for the zone 1 district. Cindy Tubb is leading with 2,394 votes while Bethanne Broux has 2,355 votes.

Flick hails Yamal’s spark in Brugge draw but warns over injury,"Barcelona manager Hansi Flick expressed delight at seeing Lamine Yamal rediscover his spark but urged caution over the teenager’s ongoing groin issue after his dazzling display in Wednesday’s 3-3 Champions League draw with Club Brugge. After battling a persistent groin injury in recent weeks, the 18-year-old built on Sunday’s La Liga outing – when he netted his first league goal since August – with another vibrant performance in Belgium, helping Barça claw back three times to secure a point. Nicolo Tresoldi and Ferran Torres exchanged early goals before Carlos Forbs put Brugge back ahead just before halftime. Yamal struck back a minute past the hour mark, slotting home coolly after slicing through the defense with a brilliant solo run. “I’m happy that Lamine is back at this level, but we don’t know what will happen tomorrow or next Sunday,” the German coach said. “The important thing is that he manages his situation because it’s not easy. He has to be really focused on how he trains and also on the treatments. Hopefully the pain goes away.” Receiving a pass outside the penalty area, Yamal surged through two defenders, laid the ball off to Fermín López, and continued his run, collecting López’s deft backheel pass before slotting in from close range. “I try to do the best I can,” Yamal said. “The move went really quick, and Fermín left me the ball with a nice flick, and I finished it.” However, Brugge winger Forbs put the hosts ahead again in the 63rd minute, and later Yamal’s other effort deflected in off Christos Tzolis to seal a 3-3 draw through an own goal. Yamal added that speculation surrounding his groin injury – and suggestions it had affected his state of mind – had been overblown and fueled by false reports. “A lot has been said about my pubalgia, that I was sad, but it was all lies,” he said. “I’ve been the same as always – very happy, focused on my work, trying to get back to training and play at this level, which is where I feel best and enjoy myself the most.” Yamal’s goal drew comparisons with Barcelona great Lionel Messi, but the Spain international said he was not getting carried away by the praise. “Messi has scored thousands of goals like that,” he said. “I have to make my own way and hope to score many more goals like that.”",2025-11-06 08:04:00,Daily Sabah,positive,0.8598,71,Alexander_Focused_Goal, Barcelona drew 3-3 with Club Brugge in the Champions League on Wednesday .

"Asking Eric: I gave daughter’s ex housing, food for 2 years so he could see his kids. Now I need him to get out","Dear Eric: Over the last 10 years, the father of my grandchildren has been a severe alcoholic. Two years ago, my daughter left him. After he had been living on the streets, my daughter asked if he could stay in my basement so that he would get sufficient rest and be able to have the children with him; she knows it’s important for the children to be with their dad. I agreed. This young man has been unemployed for at least two years. He has been going to AA, and although he has relapsed several times, he has not been violently drunk the way he was in the past. He seems to be working the program. I lent him $300 in July to pay part of an open court case he has. At that time, I wrote out that he had to have a job and pay me back the $300 by a certain date, or he would no longer be living at my house. He has interviewed for many jobs but is still unemployed. I don’t know if he self-sabotages or doesn’t follow through. What I do know is that housing him is expensive for me – feeding a 28-year-old male, and the added electricity and other utilities that, of course, he uses. The due date for the $300 is looming. Part of me thinks that his children need to be able to see him still, and maybe I should let him stay; the other part of me says that he needs to move out. He’s been given ample opportunity to make good on what he owes me and to be employed. What do you think? – Full House Dear House: The car may already be out of the driveway on this one, but it’s probably helpful to separate the loan from the housing agreement. He needs to pay you back either way. And he needs to move out. Right now, you’re overextended. You’re housing your daughter’s ex, you’re feeding him, and you’re loaning him money. It’s too much for you and it’s too much for the fraught relationship you have. I’m curious what he’s contributing to the house in return for a place to live. Even without a job, he’s capable of helping around the house, of cooking, of cleaning, of showing up for you. While it may be good for the children to have their father in their lives, you should ask whether living under your roof is the only way for him to accomplish that. Perhaps the best place for him right now is a recovery house, where he can continue to get support in working his program, as well as support and accountability in his job pursuits. Talk to him about housing first. It shouldn’t be a punishment for not repaying the loan. Instead, frame it as a conversation about the best path forward for everyone. Send questions to R.

WSCO: Chuckey man arrested in stolen camper,"Joshua York JONESBOROUGH — A Chuckey man was arrested for identity theft and having a stolen camper, according to the Washington County Sheriff's Office. Joshua Edward York, 51, was arrested Wednesday by WCSO deputies while they were responding to the 100 block of Bill Martin Road to do a premises check. Deputies said they were searching for York, who had three outstanding warrants for criminal impersonation, failure to pay child support and failure to appear in court. Deputies located York inside a camper on the property. Deputies said York provided his brother's identity and social security number after being warned that providing false identification was a felony.

Massive fortunes and properties The Golden Girls stars left behind,"They were the four mismatched roommates who redefined retirement life in Miami, but in reality, the stars of The Golden Girls were making serious bank.

Six of the most popular among them include: Prof Chukwuma Soludo, Nicholas Ukachukwu, Dr George Moghalu, Mr John Nwosu, Sir Paul Chukwuma and Chief Jeff Nweke. Of the six however, the zoning arrangement in the state which has remained an unwritten pact, but very much effective seems to make it near impossible for two of the candidates earlier mentioned. They are; Paul Chukwuma and Chief Jeff Nweke who hail from the Northern and Central senatorial zone respectively. There have been argument if others who are favoured by the zoning arrangement which favours candidates from Anambra South zone can truly unsit Soludo, who despite being from same favoured zone is also from a dominant political party (APGA) in the state, and yet holds the power of incumbency. Soludo is believed by many to have performed well in his first tenure, and is also very well liked among the people, while some other believe his administration has been trailed with poor performance and riddled with insecurity. Meanwhile, a total of 2,802,790 registered voters would participate in the election.

We will not tolerate any acts capable of compromising the integrity of the electoral process,” he vowed. Also, the head of security during election duty, CP Abayomi Shogunle who has already resumed duties told journalists through a press release signed by the spokesperson for Anambra State Police Command, SP Tochukwu Ikenga he is set for the job. Ikenga said: “Upon assumption of duty, CP Shogunle activated the IGP’s Enforcement Protocol for anti-electoral offences to ensure zero tolerance for ballot snatching, vote-buying, political thuggery, and voter intimidation. The CP has also emplace a central command framework to ensure real-time intelligence sharing, coordination, and rapid response with a joint deployment of over 60,000 security personnel of agencies within the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) who will secure the 5,720 polling units with tactical reserves along inter-LGA and State boundaries, and also designated election collation centers.” Ikenga quoted Shogunle as reiterating a total ban on all vigilante groups and all other quasi-security groups in the state as only the federal government security agencies are authorized to provide election security duties as provided by the laws of the federation. He said VIP movements with armed escorts or security aides at polling or collation centres are strictly prohibited, as violators will face immediate apprehension, withdrawal of such escorts, and prosecution. “Only designated INEC officials, accredited observers, and journalists are allowed to move freely between designated areas,” Shogunle said.

Boeing won’t face criminal charge over 737 Max crashes that killed hundreds of people,"DALLAS — Boeing will not face a criminal conspiracy charge over two 737 Max jetliner crashes that killed 346 people, after a federal judge in Texas on Thursday granted the government’s request to dismiss the case. As part of a deal to drop the charge, the American aerospace company agreed to pay or invest an additional US$1.1 billion in fines, compensation for the crash victims’ families, and internal safety and quality measures. The agreement lets Boeing choose its own compliance consultant instead of getting an independent monitor. Prosecutors said Boeing deceived government regulators about a flight-control system that was later implicated in the fatal flights. The ruling comes after an emotional hearing in September in Fort Worth where relatives of some of the victims urged U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor to reject the deal and instead appoint a special prosecutor. O’Connor wrote Thursday that the deal “fails to secure the necessary accountability to ensure the safety of the flying public.” Still, he said, the court can’t block the dismissal simply because it disagrees with the government’s view that the deal serves the public interest. The Justice Department has said a jury trial risks sparing Boeing from further punishment. The judge also said the government hadn’t acted in bad faith, had explained their decision and had met their obligations under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act. All passengers and crew died when two 737 Max jetliners went down less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019 -- a Lion Air flight that plunged into the sea off the coast of Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed into a field after taking off from Addis Ababa. Some of the victims’ families plan to appeal O’Connor’s decision. “When a company’s failures cost so many lives, ending a criminal case behind closed doors erodes trust and weakens deterrence for every passenger who steps onto a plane,” Paul Njoroge, a Canadian man who lost his wife and three small children in the Ethiopia crash, said in a statement released by the families through their lawyers. The long-running case has taken many twists and turns since the Justice Department first charged Boeing in January 2021 with defrauding the government. A proposed deal that would have required Boeing to plead guilty collapsed after O’Connor did not approve it. In a statement after Thursday’s ruling, Boeing said it would honor the agreement and continue “the significant efforts we have made as a company to strengthen our safety, quality, and compliance programs.” The Justice Department said in a statement that they are “confident that this resolution is the most just outcome.” The department has said the families of 110 crash victims either support resolving the case before it reaches trial or did not oppose the deal. Meanwhile, nearly 100 families have opposed the agreement. More than a dozen relatives spoke at the Sept. 3 hearing in Texas, with some coming from Europe and Africa. “Do not allow Boeing to buy its freedom,” said Catherine Berthet, who traveled from France. Her daughter, Camille Geoffroy, died in the Ethiopia crash. The first civil trial over that crash opened Wednesday in federal court in Chicago. The jury must decide how much Boeing has to pay the family of one victim, Shikha Garg, a United Nations consultant who was among several passengers traveling to a UN environmental assembly in Kenya. The criminal case centered around a software system that Boeing developed for the 737 Max, which airlines began flying in 2017. The plane was Boeing’s answer to a new, more fuel-efficient model from European rival Airbus, and Boeing billed it as an updated 737 that wouldn’t require much additional pilot training. But the Max did include significant changes, some of which Boeing downplayed -- most notably, the addition of an automated flight-control system designed to help account for the plane’s larger engines. Boeing didn’t mention the system in airplane manuals, and most pilots didn’t know about it. In both of the deadly crashes, that software pitched the nose of the plane down repeatedly based on faulty readings from a single sensor, and pilots flying for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines were unable to regain control. After the Ethiopia crash, the planes were grounded worldwide for 20 months. Investigators found that Boeing did not inform key Federal Aviation Administration personnel about changes it had made to the software before regulators set pilot training requirements for the Max and certified the airliner for flight.

Prince Harry's visa row back in spotlight as Andrew asked to testify in US,"Prince Harry’s visa row has been brought back into the spotlight as a result of the latest news that Andrew Mountbatten Windsor has been asked to appear before the US Congress for questioning over his links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

Read our Privacy Policy While he does not do so anymore, a previous history of drug-taking can be grounds for the US Government to reject a US visa application, with The Heritage Foundation wanting to know whether Harry told the truth on his visa and if he received special treatment as a result of his royal roots in the visa process. This is a matter that The Heritage Foundation have taken to court before, with the Trump administration unearthing new documents this year which show Harry has a so-called ""golden ticket"" visa in the form of a special A-1 'Head of State' document. This is a visa given to members of foreign royal families. Other details about his right to live in the US have not been made public, however it is believed Harry, 41, has not lied on any visa documents. Speaking on The Late Show Live about Andrew being asked testify before US Congress over his links to Epstein, The Heritage Foundation's Nile Gardiner has argued that Harry should also testify over his visa. As reported by GB News, Gardiner said: ""I do think actually, there's a far stronger case for Prince Harry to be called to testify before Congress about his illegal drug use. ""We are appealing to the Trump administration to release Prince Harry's immigration records because he admitted to extensive illegal drug use in his own book, Spare, and Prince Harry was granted entry to the United States. ""Normally, of course, if you've used illegal drugs, that's a criminal offence and it's very difficult to enter into the United States. Was he given preferential treatment or did he lie on his application form? That is a federal criminal offence that would result in deportation or five years in jail."" Harry has not been formally called to testify over the matter. He has lived in America since quitting royal life in 2020 with his wife Meghan Markle and their two children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.

Bears basking in glory of historic title run,"A school parade on Thursday afternoon starting at Moscow High School and stretching a mile to the Bear Den parking lot was only the latest in a series of tributes that have poured in for the Moscow girls soccer team in the days after its first state title in program history. In the Class 5A Inland Empire League’s postseason honors released last week, Moscow’s Jessica Brown was named coach of the year, Bear co-goalkeeper Bailie Brown was tabbed as newcomer of the year and teammates Kolbi Kiblen, Addison Lassen, Mattea Nuhn and Hazel Stevens each made the all-league team. Meanwhile, co-goalie Kyanna Winther won the Tribune’s most recent P1FCU Prep Athlete of the Week award. “Super proud of my team, and that we were able to make history,” Winther said. “It’s exciting. We definitely knew it was going to happen; we just had to get our chance at State.” The journey to State Moscow assistant coach Seth Vieux described this year’s team as a “defensive monster.” The Bears delivered 12 shutouts in 20 matches, allowing their opponents a cumulative total of 12 goals. Winther and Brown shared goalkeeping duties more or less evenly throughout the season in what Vieux called an “interesting and extremely rare” arrangement. “Goalkeeping is usually, ‘You pick one and you stick with them the whole year,’” he said. “They both just performed so well, we stuck with it.” Moscow went 7-0-2 in league play to clinch a regular-season IEL title and enter the postseason with momentum, but encountered a painful setback when it dropped a tiebreaking shootout in an Oct. 15 district tournament final against perennial nemesis Sandpoint, which has now topped Moscow at Districts the last four consecutive years. The Bears would bounce back three days later with a 3-0 shutout of Wood River in a state play-in match. “I remember our captain Kolbi Kiblen saying (after the Sandpoint loss), ‘Remember this feeling,’” Moscow’s Winnie Colvin said. “’We don’t want to feel it again; we’ve got to win next the game.’ When we got that second chance and won it, we all had full faith that we could still win State, and kept going.” Making history In their Idaho Class 5A state tournament run at Middleton High School on Oct. 23-25, the lone goal the Bears conceded came in the semifinals against top-seeded Hillcrest of Ammon, a previously unbeaten team which had scored 88 goals in its own 19-match season prior to that encounter. As time expired with the foes locked in a 1-1 dead heat, that match provided Moscow with a chance for redemption in the penalty kick tiebreak scenario — one for which the Bears had made a point of preparing themselves. “We hadn’t really worked on (PKs) before (the district final), so definitely after we had lost that game, we trained for it in practice and found our shooters,” Winther said. “Everyone was much more confident after we practiced it once or twice.” A highlight save from Winther would knock that tiebreak off the proverbial knife’s edge, giving Moscow a decisive 4-3 advantage. “After saving that one, I definitely got super excited,” Winther said. “Didn’t even know we won at first, but I looked up and saw my whole team running to me and I knew we won. That was pretty exciting.” Having overcome Hillcrest, Moscow found itself in another marathon battle the next day in the title match against Vallivue of Caldwell, which went scoreless into double-overtime before Colvin found the first and only goal, averting another potential shootout. Vieux said it was “truly a team goal,” starting with a turnover forced by the defense and transitioning to what he called an “up-back-through” play, with Edie Sumner, Rebekah Abbott and Stevens representing the three respective components. Stevens would send the ball through to Colvin, who was surging toward the Vallivue box. Then, Colvin finished it off with the goal. “She played me a really nice, well-placed and well-timed ball that I was able to advance onto,” Colvin said. “I took another touch and put it in the top right corner. I just knew I had to get it just over the goalie. Then I got rushed by my teammates and celebrated.” Vieux also praised Colvin’s poise in the biggest moment of her career so far. “This is three years of player growth, to believe in herself to finish goals and not worry (or) pull the ball back to look for somebody else,” Vieux said. “She did what everybody believed she could do.” Dawn of an era? Will this state glory remain unique in Bear soccer history, or does it herald more to come? The Bears graduate a large class of seven seniors, including starters Kiblen, Lassen, Brooklyn Becker and Kaylee Wood, and will need to rebuild the defensive back row that has been key to their success. They are, however, set to enjoy a strong and experienced rising class with the likes of Colvin, Abbott, Winther and Sumner taking up the mantle of senior leadership. “With the roster we’re going to have next year, I think we’re able to do well again, and we’ll just have to fill those spots of our missing seniors,” Vieux said. Likewise, having run the state gauntlet, Vieux is optimistic that the Bears will be well positioned to finally turn the tables on Sandpoint at the district level. “Hopefully this state title helps a lot of our players get over that mental block,” he said. Regardless, the Bears are happy for now to reap the rewards of a run that felt like a fitting display of the effort, resilience, camaraderie and unity they prided themselves on all along. “It just kind of showed that’s what Moscow soccer is,” Colvin said. “We all worked as one, and we were confident and trusted each other, and that’s how we won it.”",2025-11-07 08:04:00,Dnews,positive,0.6641,-1,Outlier," Moscow went 7-0-2 in league play to clinch a regular-season IEL title .

PM Shehbaz departs for Azerbaijan on two-day official visit,"November 07, 2025 Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev has praised Pakistan’s role in promoting regional stability in South Asia as he met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. During their meeting at the Presidential Palace in Baku on Friday, where Chief of the Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, was also present, President Ilham Aliyev thanked Pakistan for its consistent support to Azerbaijan in its just struggle against the illegal occupation of the Karabagh region. PM Shehbaz landed in Baku earlier today on a two-day official visit to Azerbaijan to attend the country's Victory Day celebrations at the invitation of Azerbaijan President Aliyev. During the visit from November 7-8, PM Shehbaz will take part in the celebrations marking the fifth anniversary of the country’s Victory Day, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office. The premier, during the meeting, reiterated that the victory of Azerbaijan against Armenia is a beacon of hope for oppressed people striving for self-determination — including the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, and Palestine. The prime minister felicitated the government and people of Azerbaijan on the Victory Day, which is observed to commemorate the historic victory in the 44-day-long Karabakh Liberation War against Armenia. He also appreciated President Aliyev for signing the historic peace agreement with Armenia earlier this year. The two leaders reviewed the whole range of bilateral relationships and agreed to further strengthen their multi-layered cooperation in the fields of politics, trade and investment, energy, connectivity, and defence. PM Shehbaz extended an invitation to President Aliyev to visit Pakistan at his earliest convenience, which he graciously accepted.

Asking Eric: Older brother not sure what to do with younger sibling’s constant ‘larger than life’ tales,"Dear Eric: My younger brother, who is 70, has always been known to embellish stories and has a bigger-than-life heart. More recently his stories are pure fantasy tales. His house has become borderline hoarder for several years. His stories contradict what he tells me – “I’m clearing out clutter “ only to hear he’s going to hire some company to clean the clutter. He has a difficult time staying focused on the task at hand. He’s had a “business plan” for his “business” that, while feasible, hasn’t brought him any income for 10 years. As the older brother, any comments I’ve made are faced with extreme defensive statements, so I refrain and continue to listen to story after story with no focus – buying/not buying new car, seeking house/not selling house to move to West Coast, next vacation trip, how much he wants to visit us, et cetera, et cetera. When do I wave the white flag? – White Flag for White Lies Dear White Flag: Is your brother looking for advice or looking for an audience? As the older brother, you may have fallen into a pattern of giving his plans critique and approval. That may not be what he’s seeking right now, hence the defensiveness. And hence your fatigue. If you’ve spent decades telling him the right way to do things and he has spent decades doing things his own way, it’s no wonder you feel you’re at an impasse. One way to wave the white flag while still maintaining your relationship is by practicing distance from his stories. When he’s telling you something, try to remember that this is his journey and it doesn’t affect you. You might even want to visualize yourself letting it fall from your hands. And what do you say in response? “Oh, OK.” Simple, noncommittal. You also don’t have to subject yourself to every flight of fancy. You may not be the right audience for him and you’re not under an obligation to be. Letting go can also look like you saying, “I’m glad you’ve got a plan but I’m not in a place to chat about it right now. Can we talk about something else?” Send questions to R.

Opinion: From service to civic engagement: Honoring Iowa veterans today and every day,"This November, we proudly observe Military Family Appreciation Month and Veterans Day, two opportunities to honor the courage and sacrifice of Iowa’s brave military members and their families. Veterans Day recognizes the dedication and sacrifice of our nation’s brave men and women who put it all on the line to maintain our freedom and peace. What began as Armistice Day, more than a century ago, paying tribute to those who fought in World War I, has endured and evolved into a day that pays homage to current military members and veterans of all wars. The first Armistice Day was proclaimed on Nov. 11, 1919 by then-President Woodrow Wilson. “To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country’s service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the council of nations..”. It was recognized with parades, public recognitions, and suspension of business. I am honored to have descended from several brave individuals who gave their all to defend this nation. From fighting in the Ohio Infantry during the Civil War, serving in Cuba during the Spanish American War, and defending democracy and freedom in the Army during World War II, I could not be prouder to claim them as family. And many of my fellow Iowans have descended from the strong men and women who have stepped up to serve our great nation. Iowa has a history of stepping up. At least 41 veterans of the Revolution are buried in Iowa. More than 1,000 Iowans bore arms in the Mexican War, 76,000 in the Civil War, and 5,600 in the Spanish-American War. In World War I and World War II, over 375,000 served. We saw 85,000 serve in the Korean War, 115,000 in the Vietnam War, 3,000 in the Persian Gulf War. And more recently, more than 3,000 brave Iowa men and women served in Operation Desert Storm and around 20,000 Iowans bore arms in the War on Terrorism. Currently, Iowa has nearly 2,000 Iowa National Guard and 1,800 Iowa Reserves members deployed, actively serving our nation. Our thoughts are with these brave individuals and their families as they work to protect our freedom. As we pause on this day, contemplating the history of our nation and giving thanks to all the brave soldiers who have served our country, I encourage you to reach out to a veteran or military member in your life and thank them for their service. A simple gesture, a phone call, a message, or a heartfelt conversation can mean the world to someone who has sacrificed so much. I also invite you to visit the ‘Honor a Veteran’ page on sos.iowa.gov, where you can leave a tribute to a veteran who has made a difference in your life. Since its inception in 2012, this initiative has collected over 9,500 tributes. As part of this initiative, we encourage eligible Iowa voters to not only honor a veteran, but to honor them with your vote. Participating in our elections process and exercising your fundamental right to vote is a beautiful way to honor those who have fought for our nation and protected these fundamental rights. Thank you again to the brave men and women. We can never thank you enough for your sacrifice.",2025-11-07 20:07:00,Newtondailynews,positive,0.6066,47,Simwa_Better_Flag," Veterans Day recognizes the dedication and sacrifice of our nation’s brave men and women who put it all on the line to maintain our freedom and peace .

Disagreement Between Two Kidney Function Tests Predicts Serious Health Problems,"NEW YORK and HOUSTON, Nov. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A mismatch between two common tests for kidney function may indicate a higher risk for kidney failure, heart disease, and death, a new study shows. Health care providers for decades have measured blood levels of the molecule creatinine to track the rate at which kidneys filter waste from muscle breakdown in the bloodstream. According to more recent guidelines, levels of cystatin C, a small protein made by all cells in the body, can also be used to measure kidney function. Since these two tests are influenced by different factors — including some related to disease or aging — using both markers together can provide a better measure of kidney function and risk of organ failure than either one alone. Led by NYU Langone Health researchers, the new work reveals that many people, especially those who are sick, often have a large gap between the two readings, which may be a signal of future disease. Specifically, the global study shows that more than a third of hospitalized participants had a cystatin C-based readout of kidney function that was at least 30% lower than one based on their creatinine levels. ""Our findings highlight the importance of measuring both creatinine and cystatin C to gain a true understanding of how well the kidneys are working, particularly among older and sicker adults,"" said study co-corresponding author Morgan Grams, MD, PhD. ""Evaluating both biomarkers may identify far more people with poor kidney function, and earlier in the disease process, by covering the blind spots that go with either test."" The study is publishing online Nov. 7 in the Journal of the American Medical Association and is simultaneously being presented at the American Society of Nephrology's annual Kidney Week conference. Beyond detecting signs of disease, assessing patients' kidney function is important for calculating the appropriate dosage for cancer medicines, antibiotics, and many other drugs, says Grams, the Susan and Morris Mark Professor of Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. During another investigation, the results of which were published the same day, the same research team found that a record number of people worldwide have chronic kidney disease, which is now the ninth leading cause of death globally. Having new ways to spot the condition early can help ensure that patients receive swift treatment and avoid more dramatic interventions such as dialysis and organ transplantation, says Grams, who is also a professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. For the recent investigation, the research team analyzed health care records, blood tests, and demographic data collected from 860,966 men and women of a half-dozen nationalities. All participants had their creatinine and cystatin C levels measured on the same day and received follow-ups 11 years later on average. The team considered factors unrelated to kidney function that influence the biomarkers' readings, such as smoking, obesity, and history of cancer. Performed as part of the international Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium, the study is the largest to date to explore differences between the two tests and whether they may signal potential health problems, the authors say. Established to better understand and treat the condition, the consortium provides evidence for global definitions of chronic kidney disease and related health risks. According to the new findings, those whose cystatin C-based measures of kidney filtration were at least 30% lower than their creatinine-based measures were at higher risk for death, heart disease, and heart failure than those who had a smaller difference between the two metrics. The former group was also more likely to be diagnosed with severe chronic kidney disease that required dialysis or an organ transplant. The same was found for 11% of outpatients and seemingly healthy volunteers. Grams notes that while cystatin C testing was first recommended in 2012 by the international organization Kidney Disease — Improving Global Outcomes, a 2019 survey revealed that less than 10% of clinical laboratories in the United States performed it in-house. The two largest laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp, now offer the test. ""These results underscore the need for physicians to take advantage of the fact that more hospitals and health care providers are starting to offer cystatin C testing,"" said study co-corresponding author Josef Coresh, MD, PhD, director of NYU Langone's Optimal Aging Institute. ""Physicians might otherwise miss out on valuable information about their patients' well-being and future medical concerns."" Coresh, who is also the Terry and Mel Karmazin Professor of Population Health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, cautions that among the hospitalized Americans in the study, less than 1% were tested for cystatin C. Funding for the study was provided by National Institutes of Health grant R01DK100446 and by the National Kidney Foundation. Michelle Estrella, MD, MHS, at the University of California, San Francisco, is the study's first author. Kai-Uwe Eckardt, MD, at Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin in Germany, is the study last author. Along with Grams and Coresh, who are co-leaders of the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium, NYU Langone researchers involved in the study are Shoshana Ballew, PhD; Yingying Sang, MS; and Aditya Surapaneni, PhD.

Mario Kart Hot Wheels Tracks Get Massive Early Black Friday Discounts,"Save big on the Amazon-exclusive Mario Kart Circuit Track Set and the recently released Bowser's Castle Raceway. By Steven Petite on November 7, 2025 at 12:07PM PST Hot Wheels Mario Kart: Bowser's Castle Raceway $56 (was $86.39) Hot Wheels: Mario Kart Circuit Track Set $68 (was $98) | Amazon Exclusive The two coolest Hot Wheels Mario Kart tracks sold on Amazon are discounted to superb prices this weekend. The Amazon-exclusive Mario Kart Circuit Track Set is down to $68 (was $98). Over 10% of units are claimed at the time of writing, so snag the Circuit Track while you can. Mario Kart fans should also check out the recently released Bowser's Castle Raceway Track Set. Released in September for $86, Bowser's Castle Raceway is on sale for $56 at Amazon, Walmart, and Target. For Mario Kart Hot Wheels collectors, Bowser's Castle Raceway marks the first appearance of Kamek. You'll also have plenty of storage space for your collection, as the castle doubles as a 35-car garage. Notably, this is the first Mario Kart set to use Hot Wheels' new Speed Snap assembly system. Bowser's Castle Raceway looks significantly cooler than the ""Bowser's Castle"" track set that's exclusive to Target. That one simply has a Bowser figure who tries to stop racers from making the loop. But Bowser's Castle Raceway has a proper castle in the center of the track. Kamek or other Mario Kart racers you already own zip across the treacherous track via a slam launcher. Bowser's minions will try to stop you in a variety of ways, which is awkward since Kamek is Bowser's right-hand Koopa, but perhaps Bullet Bill, Dry Bones, Lakitu, and the castle itself are jealous of that. The track has one tall loop that sends your racer through the castle door. This 34-inch track is one of the larger Mario Kart Hot Wheel sets actively being produced today. As mentioned, Bowser's Castle Raceway implements the new Speed Snap connection system, which makes track pieces easier for kids to assemble. And as the name suggests, the system makes the assembly and teardown processes quicker in general. The Amazon-exclusive Mario Kart Circuit Track Set comes with two diecast racers with their standard karts: Mario and Yoshi. The Circuit Track has two lanes and motorized boosters. Powered by four D batteries, the Circuit Track is one of the coolest Mario Kart Hot Wheels courses. The boosters provide enough force for the karts to make continuous loops around the track. After placing the karts on the launchpad, pressing the Super Mushroom button sends them through the booster and around the track. You can derail the competition in the other lane by pressing the Green Shell button at the right time. The finish line flags move down as you complete laps. The first racer to cross the finish line six times wins. The Circuit Track Set measures 25 x 43 x 16 inches. Smaller Hot Wheels Mario Kart tracks can be added to the course to introduce new obstacles and pathways. The Circuit Track is compatible with the Thwomp Ruins Playset and Piranha Plant Slide Playset. The Piranha Plant Launcher includes Yoshi with his Mach 8 Kart and is on sale for only $14.69 (was $24) at Amazon. Thwomp Ruins is sold out at Amazon, but you can get it for $18.19 (was $26) at Target. It comes with a Luigi Standard Kart. Several other Hot Wheels Mario Kart Track Sets are on sale ahead of Black Friday 2025, including the smaller Bowser's Castle Track Set for $35 (was $50). Mario Kart Hot Wheels Diecast Cars Check out dozens of kart packs and solo racers. Since track sets only include one or two karts, you may want a few additional racers to go with this set. A fitting choice would be the Amazon-exclusive Mario Kart Diecast Car 4-Pack, as it features Bowser, Mario, Luigi, and Black Yoshi for $26. There are several other sets of four Mario Kart racers at Amazon for around the same price.

Offshore oil workers must lose weight or face losing their jobs under new safety measures,"North Sea oil workers have been told they must lose weight if they want to keep flying offshore, or face losing their jobs. Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) said that from November next year, the maximum weight for a clothed worker should be 124.7kg, so they can be winched by a rescue helicopter in an emergency. A coastguard helicopter can carry a maximum of 249kg, but also has to account for the weight of the average rescue worker (90.3kg), their kit (5kg) and a stretcher (29kg). The OEUK told The Independent that some 2,277 offshore workers weighed above the 124kg limit last year. The industry body said it had decided on the weight limit after an “extensive” review over the last two-and-a-half years, “thoroughly” considering alternatives to a weight limit. Graham Skinner, the health and safety manager at OEUK, said the organisation will be ""working really hard"" over the next 12 months to ensure affected workers can lose weight. Mr Skinner told the BBC that he could not rule out the possibility that the new safety policy would lead to job losses. ""That would be the absolute worst-case scenario,” he said, explaining that employers will now have a responsibility to try to support their workers to fall within the limit by next year. He said it was important that a clear message be conveyed, serving as an “impetus for everyone to get behind the policy and lose weight in time for November next year”. Those who do not meet the 124kg limit “will not get their medical and that will preclude them from getting on a helicopter”. The decision was made to announce the policy this year so that employers could prepare their staff, offer support and address concerns within the workforce. The policy itself was developed in response to concerns highlighted by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and will come into effect on November 1, 2026. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Skinner said there were a further 2,500 offshore workers who were ""below the weight limit but might need some additional support and weight management"", meaning ""5,000 is the total number of people who might be affected to some lesser or greater extent"" by the policy change. John Boland, the regional officer at the Unite union, told the BBC that “there can be support put in” to stop people from losing their jobs. ""The biggest concerns we have had are from individuals that are naturally larger built and in some cases are extremely fit but are above that actual weight limit.

Latest hostage remains returned from Gaza identified as Israeli man,"A Red Cross vehicle carrying the body of a person believed to be a deceased hostage (Abdel Kareem Hana/AP) Israel said on Saturday that the remains of a hostage returned from Gaza the previous night belong to an Israeli man who died while fighting Hamas in the militants’ October 7 2023 attack that started the war. The identification marked another step forward for the tenuous, US-brokered ceasefire. The body was identified as that of Lior Rudaeff, according to a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Mr Rudaeff was born in Argentina and moved to Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak, a farming community in southern Israel, as a child. He volunteered for more than 40 years as an ambulance driver and was a member of the community’s emergency response team. The forum said he was killed in the Hamas-led attack and that his body was taken to Gaza. Since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, Palestinian militants have released the remains of 23 hostages, including Mr Rudaeff’s body, with five still remaining in Gaza. As part of the deal, Israel has returned the remains of 15 Palestinians for each Israeli hostage. So far, Israel has handed over the bodies of 285 Palestinians, the Red Cross and Gaza’s Health Ministry say. Health officials in Gaza have struggled to identify the bodies without access to DNA kits and have identified 84 of the bodies. Under the terms of the ceasefire, Israel is supposed to allow substantially more aid into Gaza. However, relief efforts under the pact still fall well short of what is needed in Gaza, according to Farhan Haqq, deputy spokesperson for the United Nations. More than 200,000 metric tons in aid is positioned to move into Gaza, but only 37,000 tons, mostly food, have been admitted, he said. The 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage. Israel’s sweeping military offensive has killed more than 68,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

"Dear Abby: Snotty sister thinks she’s better than me, says I’m now ‘dead’ to her","DEAR ABBY: My older sister thinks she’s better than me. She makes little snide comments and thinks it’s OK. It has led to a couple of big arguments in the past seven years. The last argument was over some money I was missing. She’s been stealing from anybody and everybody -- from hospitals, doctors’ offices, family members and her boyfriend’s family. When I realized that she had stolen money from me as well, it was the last straw. I confronted her, and her response was I am now “dead to her.” We haven’t spoken in several months. Her boyfriend died last week, and she hasn’t told me. (I found out on social media.) Should I reach out to her about funeral arrangements or contact his family instead? His family never really talked to any of us. They didn’t like her because they thought she was only there for his money. -- OUT OF THE LOOP IN ARIZONA DEAR OUT: Unless you feel the need to attempt to make up with your troubled sister, do not reach out. However, if you want to do something for the boyfriend’s family, send them a nice condolence card expressing your sympathy. DEAR ABBY: My niece-in-law, “Justine,” is a few years younger than my husband and I. We have been best friends for the last 25 years. She’s 55 and divorced, with a grown daughter but no man in her life. She’s extremely lonely and has only us as emotional support. During the last year, she has had to move her 78-year-old mother (with whom she has a tumultuous relationship) in with her. Justine’s daughter has distanced herself from her mother because Justine has erratic moods. Recently, she sent me a four-page letter saying how angry she was with me and my family about things that never happened. She invented transgressions, insulted my grown children and targeted my daughter-in-law. My son is furious. My husband, who loves Justine and feels like an older brother, says he wants to repair our family. I love my husband, but my first allegiance is to my kids, and I’m surprised and hurt that he isn’t furious with her for attacking me with untruths. He says we have to find a way to get past this. (She didn’t include him in her letter.) I’m trying to be prepared for upcoming family gatherings. What can be done to repair this? -- LOOKING FOR A WAY IN THE SOUTH DEAR LOOKING: If Justine is inventing things that never happened in order to justify her anger, the chances are great that she is mentally ill. Until she is willing to recognize that she is driving away the people who care for her the most, things may get worse. Suggest to your husband that if he can convince Justine to get the help she needs, you are prepared to forgive her for the hurt she is causing. Then all of you should cross your fingers and hope that she sees the wisdom. Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

"Moyes emulates Wenger, Ferguson feat as Everton ease past Fulham","Everton head coach David Moyes joined Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson in an exclusive managerial club as he led the Toffees to a 2-0 Premier League win at home to Fulham. The statistics suggested that the fired-up hosts ought to have gone into half time in the ascendancy, but Marco Silva's men had seemingly done enough to keep their hosts at bay in the first 45 minutes. That was until the fourth minute of injury time, though, as veteran midfielder Idrissa Gueye bundled home a deserved opener for the hosts after a period of penalty-box pinball. Moyes's men also had two strikes disallowed in the first half before having another effort ruled out at the start of the second period, after which the Cottagers belatedly improved with and without the ball. However, the visitors' efforts were not helped by a cruel injury to striker Rodrigo Muniz - who came off just 17 minutes after being sent on as a substitute - and Everton killed the game off via a Michael Keane header in the closing stages. Moyes's triumph on Saturday was his 20th against Fulham in the Premier League, meaning that the Scotsman is just the third manager to win 20+ games against a single side in the competition after Wenger (four teams) and Ferguson (eight clubs). Back to winning ways at the Hill Dickinson Stadium, Everton have now risen to 11th in the Premier League table, four points and four places above Fulham in 15th. Everton are back to doing what they do best - winning football matches at home - while Fulham's abysmal away-day trend is showing no sign of ending anytime soon. Proving that their 3-0 beatdown at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur was an anomaly - at least for now - the Toffees were on it from the get-go and thoroughly deserved to draw first blood before the interval. Silva's men improved after the manager sent on the effervescent Joshua King, but Muniz's unfortunate injury left the visitors without an out-and-out number nine on the pitch, and it showed. Fulham have now suffered a worrying five consecutive defeats away from home - deficiencies that Silva must address if his side are to avoid being sucked into a relegation battle, as the dreaded drop zone is coming closer into view. 45 +4 min: Everton 1-0 Fulham (Idrissa Gueye) Not one of the more conventional goals you will ever see, but a potentially crucial one nonetheless! Vitaliy Mykolenko's cross causes carnage in the penalty box, as James Tarkowski's header crashes the bar, Tim Iroegbunam swipes at the follow-up, and eventually Gueye arrives to awkwardly toe-poke the ball home. 81st min: Everton 2-0 Fulham (Michael Keane) After copious amounts of Fulham pressure, the inevitable has occurred - Everton have doubled their lead and will surely now see this one out! The defensive players are proving their attacking worth for the hosts today, as Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's inswinging corner is on the money for Keane, who mistimes his header but nevertheless shoulders the ball into the roof of the net. Running the show in the first half and providing a sumptuous set-piece for Keane to head home in the second 45, Dewsbury-Hall is a man who is enjoying every minute of his football at present. The former Chelsea man also won a praiseworthy nine of his 13 ground duels, as well as drawing three fouls and registering an 87% pass accuracy during an all-round exemplary display. Possession: Everton 51%-49% Fulham Shots: Everton 14-8 Fulham Shots on target: Everton 5-4 Fulham Corners: Everton 7-3 Fulham Fouls: Everton 11-14 Fulham Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's first half by numbers vs. Fulham: 9/9 duels won 5 tackles 3 fouls won 3x possession won 1 chance created 0 fouls conceded #EVEFUL pic.twitter.com/7nXMrjuI5T Everton's first game back after the international break is a poignant one for Moyes, who returns to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on November 24.

Genesee drops barnburner to Wallace in 1A state quarterfinals,"GENESEE — On a night dominated by both teams’ offenses, it was a defensive play that decided the Idaho Class 1A state playoff quarterfinals. And the player who made the play almost didn’t play past halftime. With a chance to win, Wallace junior linebacker Marley Pearce, who had exited the contest earlier in the game with an injury, made the season-extending tackle of Genesee Bulldogs quarterback Jackson Banks on the would-be game-tying 2-point attempt to secure the Miners’ 68-66 overtime win on Friday at Genesee High School. “He wanted to win, so we had to put him back in the second half, and he battled,” Wallace junior Henry Larson said of Pearce. “He’s the heart of the defense right there.” Thanks to a couple of recovered onside kickoff and a nearly unstoppable passing attack, Wallace rattled off 28 points in the fourth quarter, scored the critical 2-point conversion in overtime and stopped the Bulldogs on their 2-point attempt in an absolute classic of a football game. The overtime victory sent Wallace (9-2) to the semifinals of the Idaho 1A state playoffs, where the Miners will face Tri-Valley. For Genesee, its season ended at 8-2. “Hats off to Genesee,” Wallace coach Jared Young said. “Those kids played their butts off. They ran that option really well. Tonight, we’re fortunate to come out with this one. I mean, any playoff win is awesome, whether you win by two points or 60, or whatever — a win’s a win. We love it.” A thrilling finish Wallace led by 14 after the first quarter and by two at halftime. Genesee led by 14 early in the fourth, but the dual two-score deficits were merely fleeting moments in a back-and-forth contest that elapsed over three hours of real time, featured an extra period of football and had 18 total touchdowns and 134 combined points. “How can you not be on cloud nine after an overtime victory in the quarterfinals to go to the semis,” Young said. “I’m sure everybody in the stadium thought they had us in that fourth quarter, but our boys just rallied, came together, and we made some key plays at the end, and that was the difference.” The Miners “pulled a rabbit out of a hat,” as Young put it, to catch Genesee off guard on fourth down early in the fourth quarter. Wallace quarterback Cooper Miller lateraled the ball across the field to Lennox Radford, who sent the ball sailing back to Miller, who churned through the Genesee defense on his way to a 35-yard touchdown. That trick play reanimated the Miners with 8:19 to go. Including that touchdown, Wallace outscored Genesee 36-18 the rest of the way to claim the two-point overtime victory. The Miners recovered two kickoffs — one of which allowed Wallace to double up and erase the Bulldogs’ lead. With 1:47 left in regulation, Wallace tied the game at 52 apiece. The first half ended with three touchdowns in the final 1:13 and the second half ended at a similar breakneck pace, with Banks’ rushing TD giving Genesee the lead back with 31 seconds left, and Wallace’s Miller traversing half the field to find tight end Gus Scott for both the touchdown and the game-tying 2-point conversion to force overtime. Then, the teams traded touchdowns in overtime, but Genesee could not find the two points it needed to extend the game. “I feel bad for Genesee,” Young said. “They deserve this win just as much as we do. They outplayed us for most of the game and we were just fortunate to have a few plays go our way at the end.” Miller, Wallace’s QB, racked up nearly 350 yards passing, with Larson accounting for 183 yards receiving and Radford gaining over 100 yards through the air. A pair of standout juniors Genesee wide receiver Noah Bollman was responsible for more than 150 all-purpose yards and six touchdowns. He also made several standout defensive plays in coverage, batting down key Wallace passes. “He’s a heck of a player. He’s everywhere. He’s our go-to guy,” Genesee coach Jason Hanson said of Bollman. “They pretty much had to throw to the other side because he was shutting everything down on his side. His leadership and his grit also helped propel us forward.” Hanson said that Banks, his QB, showed incredible moxie and leadership to help Genesee get to this point on both the offensive and defensive end. The junior signal-caller threw for 170 yards and ran for more than 60 yards on the ground. He also batted away a 2-point conversion pass that would have won Wallace the game much sooner. “He’s an extra coach,” Hanson said. “We gave him a couple plays, and, you know, he can call his own stuff. It’s really just that whole concept of seeing it out there and living in the moment and he’s really lifting up his guys.” A strong campaign for Genesee It was a heartbreaking finish for Genesee, which last advanced this far into a postseason in 2021. The Bulldogs started the season 7-0 before losing the league title to Deary. The Bulldogs enjoyed a slew of solid contributors, including Cameron Holmes and Carsen Warner-Hall. “It always ends bittersweet even if you win at all; you’re still a bus full of tears just because it ended,” Hanson said. “They just really took everything that they could possibly do to get better every week, and not every team is going to do that. And so we really showed a lot of gumption, as far as all, from the youngest freshman to the seniors, to just improve. “It’s been a long time since Genesee has played this deep into November.” Wallace 16 16 0 28 8—68 Genesee 6 24 8 22 6—66 FIRST QUARTER Genesse— Cameron Holmes 3 run (run failed), 8:29 Wallace — Henry Larson 50 pass from Cooper Miller (Miller run), 7:45 Wallace — Lennox Radford 5 pass from Miller (Larson pass from Miller), :06.

Parties must pledge in manifestos to eliminate discrimination: Debapriya,"Democracy will not sustain if discrimination cannot be eliminated, said noted political and legal analysts and civil society leaders today. ""If we cannot eliminate discrimination, democracy will not be protected in the future because the institutions we create will not be difficult to overcome or break down,"" said SR Osmani, professor of Development Economics at the University of Ulster. Osmani's comment came at a discussion on anti-discriminatory law organised by Citizen's Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh organised the event in collaboration with the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST), Manusher Jonno Foundation, and Nagorik Uddyog (Citizen's Initiative), with support from Switzerland and UNDP, at the Bangladesh-China Conference Centre in the city today. Democracy can go astray due to the tyranny of the majority, but there are two main ways to prevent it: one is by creating institutional obstacles, but there is no guarantee that they will be permanent and effective. In the past, despite constitutional guarantees and recognition, institution after institution has been destroyed, first for party interests, and then for individual interests. ""The answer, therefore, is in the people, who must take responsibility for protecting their power."" However, the vast majority of these people are victims of discrimination, which starts with socio-economic disparities and ultimately turns into a disparity in political power. When those who are oppressed are asked whether they want democracy or autocracy, they prefer democracy. However, due to discrimination, the attraction towards democracy often decreases over time and they get frustrated and that leads to apathy. ""This then takes them far away from that deliberative democracy or public reason. At that point, they lack the opportunity to enter the discussion forum, and the ruling party, individual or group takes advantage of this lack of opportunity and this apathy."" The ruling group accumulates more power by exploiting the apathy and consequently accumulating more power. ""In this way, the decline of democracy gradually occurs. This eventually enables the rise of autocracy. Therefore, eradication of discrimination is a must alongside creating institutional obstacles to prevent the decay of democracy,"" Osmani added. The core spirit of the July uprising was anti-discrimination and what emerged out of it are the guarantee of justice, elections and reforms, said Debapriya Bhattacharya, convener of the Citizen's Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh. In order to get justice, citizens must be protected from discrimination. When citizens are empowered, they can express their opinions and actively take part in political and governance process. ""Effective reform is in no way possible without ensuring the rights of the citizens,"" said Bhattacharya, also a distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue. If discrimination continues and deepens, it will not only hinder justice or reform but will also eventually endanger democracy and development. Subsequently, he called on the interim government to issue an ordinance of the anti-discrimination law. The political parties should include in the manifesto that the law is passed in the next parliament, he added. The civil society groups for long have experienced that there were various forms of discrimination in the society in the names of caste, creed, ethnicity and gender and initiated drafting an anti-discrimination law in 2013, said Shaheen Anam, executive director of Manusher Jonno Foundation. Finally, the cabinet had approved a draft law that went to the standing committee in 2022. The draft was not passed for unknown reasons despite promises by the then law minister. The promise of the Liberation War and the July Uprising was to build a humane, non-discriminatory society free from inequality. ""But that has not been possible yet,"" she said. As per the constitution of Bangladesh, all citizens are equal, but the country repeatedly sows divisions based on religion, said Attorney General Md Asaduzzaman. In recent times, another division has entered the scene: political discrimination. ""The entire social system has been driven into such a vicious cycle of criminalisation of politics,"" he said, while calling for coming out of such social, religious and political divisions and discriminations. Asaduzzaman suggested that the civil society make necessary amendments to the draft anti-discrimination law and push the law ministry and law commission on this.",2025-11-08 08:03:56,The Daily Star,neutral,0.565,60,Jonno_Citizen_Police," Democracy will not sustain if discrimination cannot be eliminated, said noted political and legal analysts and civil society leaders today .

Five changes to income tax as UK households face 'maximum' £624 hit,"All the changes Labour Party Chancellor Rachel Reeves could make to income tax in the Autumn Budget have been revealed. There are five ways Ms Reeves could go about shaking up income tax as the Labour Party Autumn Budget is delivered on November 26. Ms Reeves has said she has to “deal with the world as I find it, not the world as I might wish it to be”. And Ms Reeves has spoken of the government’s desire to get those with the “broadest shoulders” to pay more. ""We all need to do our bit,” Ms Reeves said - suggesting everybody could be in the firing line. And Ms Reeves said she would not duck the difficult choices ahead, even if they broke her pledge not to put up income tax, VAT or national insurance. READ MORE Drivers face new monitoring device in cars under UK pay-per-mile tax She said: “I could do what previous governments have done, which is to sweep those challenges under the carpet, to cut capital spending, to make the numbers up. “But then we’d be back here in a year, in five years’ time, with productivity still on its knees, growth underperforming, national debt continuing to rise. So I’m being honest with people.” Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says an income tax rise “would be incredibly difficult politically” and “hit taxpayers hard, adding hundreds of pounds to their tax bill every year”. “If government wanted to change income tax, the most straightforward option would be to add 1p to the basic rate of tax, increasing it from 20% to 21%,” says Laura Suter, the director of personal finance at AJ Bell. “That would cost taxpayers up to £377 a year in extra tax, with anyone earning £50,270 or more facing the maximum hit.” Adding 1p on higher-rate income tax would generate an extra £1.6bn in 2026/7 and a total of £5.8bn over the next three years, according to the same HMRC data. Putting 1p on the additional rate that kicks in at £125,140 raises even less – at £145m in 2026-27 and £640m over three years. “If you earned £35,000 a year, an extra 1p on higher-rate tax wouldn’t cost you anything,” says Coles. “The more you earn, the harder this hits, so if you earned £55,000, it would cost you an extra £47 a year and if you earned £75,000, it would cost you an extra £247.” If an extra 1p was added at every level, someone earning £35,000 a year would see the same change as just a basic rate rise – at £224. If they earned £55,000, it would cost them an extra £424 and if they earn £75,000, it adds up to £624 more. Increasing all rates of income tax by one percentage point would yield almost £11bn a year by 2029–30. A plan to increase income tax rates and lower national insurance rates by two percentage points has also been mooted. Tom Selby, the director of public policy at AJ Bell, says doing it this way means Reeves could still “claim to be protecting the pay packets of ‘working people’”. Tom says: “This would not be the case for retirees. Someone with a taxable retirement income of £35,000 would face a tax hike of almost £450, while a pensioner with an income of £65,000 would be stung with a tax increase of more than £1,000.” “While hitting pensioners in the pocket will clearly be unpopular – particularly in the wake of the winter fuel payment fiasco - it may be viewed as the least bad option."" “It’s taxation by stealth: the rates stay the same, but a bigger slice of your pay disappears into the taxman’s coffers,” says Ade Babatunde, the senior financial planning director at the wealth manager Rathbones.",2025-11-08 08:03:48,Birmingham Live,neutral,0.78,6,Executive_Government_Plans," Labour Party Chancellor Rachel Reeves could shake up income tax in Autumn Budget .

"Facilitated Telemedicine Boosts Long-Term Recovery for Patients with HCV and OUD, with Andrew Talal, MD","Integrating facilitated telemedicine into opioid treatment programs led to SVR, improved patient satisfaction, and long-term health gains 5 years post-cure. New research reveals the benefits of facilitated medicine for patients impacted by hepatitis C virus (HCV) and in treatment for opioid use disorders (OUD), highlighting the long-term impact of sustained virological response (SVR) and sobriety.1 Andrew Talal, MD, a professor of medicine at the University at Buffalo, presented the findings at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) The Liver Meeting 2025. The data reports sustained improvements in patient health, recovery, and satisfaction 5 years after HCV cure when treated via facilitated telemedicine integrated into opioid treatment programs (OTPs). “Building trust between the patient and the facilitator case manager, it was that trust that then enabled them to start the hepatitis C treatment and to continue it when there was a problem,” said Talal. “They knew who to talk to in getting treated. If there were certain logistical barriers, the case managers helped patients to overcome those barriers.” The rising opioid epidemic runs parallel with the increasing rates of HCV infection, which affect a disproportionate number of people who inject drugs. Achieving SVR is a functional cure of HCV and eliminates transmission risk, thereby stopping further spread. Many barriers to care exist for those with OUD, including denial of access to HCV treatment due to stigma surrounding non-adherence and perceived risks of reinfection. In the study, OUD-specific barriers included competing healthcare priorities and insurance restrictions.2 Previous studies have explored the positive impacts of receiving HCV therapy in conjunction with OUD treatment. Addressing drug use-related harms, including overdose deaths, while administering HCV treatment can be a method to engage patients in OTPs in their overall health. Facilitated telemedicine for HCV offers patients treatment options available directly within OTPs, highlighting convenience and accessibility. “The facilitated telemedicine really integrates both a social component as well as a technical component,” said Talal. “Having a facilitator, a case manager, on site within the opioid treatment program really worked to build trust with patients. The technical component really comes from the ability to bring the hep C provider to that site, making it much more convenient for patients to engage in Hep C care at a place where they're already getting care treatment.” Investigators conducted 2 focus group discussions (FGD) with 9 participants who had previously taken part in a randomized controlled trial of facilitated telemedicine and were actively enrolled in OTPs 5 years post-achieving SVR. Participants had a mean age of 52.6 years (SD, 13.7), 66.6% were male, and 88.8% identified as White. Participants were engaged in the research process through a Patient Advisory Committee to provide individualized feedback on study conduct. The key endpoints were participant feedback to evaluate the long-term impact and sustainability to inform future policy development. The 3 FGD themes were as follows: attitudes towards HCV and barriers to treatment among people with OUD; embracing facilitated telemedicine for HCV care integrated into OTPs; and experiencing long-term benefits from facilitated telemedicine across all aspects of HCV care and overall well-being. Participants advocated for facilitated telemedicine’s convenience, empathetic clinicians, and “one-stop shop” approach. According to Talal, the future of HCV treatment in patient populations includes universal screening and the application of the facilitated telemedicine model to other settings, such as rural healthcare environments.

‘A complete fabrication’ — Modu Sheriff says he didn’t accuse Shettima of creating Boko Haram,"Ali Modu Sheriff, former governor of Borno state, has denied claims that he accused Vice-President Kashim Shettima of creating Boko Haram, describing the report as “false, malicious, and dangerous”. A publication circulating online had quoted Sheriff as saying, “It’s not me; it’s Shettima who created Boko Haram.” The report was first published in August 2016. But in a statement issued on Saturday, Sheriff dismissed the report as a “complete fabrication” aimed at misleading the public and stirring political discord. “The said story is a complete fabrication, devoid of truth, and a deliberate attempt to mislead the public, malign the person of Senator Sheriff, and sow discord within the nation’s political landscape,” the statement reads. Sheriff said he never granted any interview or spoke to any journalist on the matter, adding that the falsehood was designed to undermine his long-standing commitment to peace and national unity. “This false report is not only mischievous but also a dangerous piece of fake news aimed at undermining years of Senator Sheriff’s contributions to peace, national unity, and development, both in Borno State and across Nigeria,” the statement added. The former governor urged members of the public and the media to disregard the publication, noting that he had directed his legal team to identify and pursue those behind the story. “Senator Sheriff has instructed his legal team to take immediate steps to identify all individuals, bloggers, or media outlets responsible for the dissemination of this defamatory material,” his media office said. “Should the false publication not be retracted and taken down forthwith, the Senator will not hesitate to seek full legal redress under the law.” Sheriff reaffirmed his commitment to Nigeria’s security, stability, and democratic values and vowed to ensure that the spread of misinformation does not go unpunished.",2025-11-08 20:07:00,Nigeria News,negative,0.5223,41,Concern_Decades_Security," Ali Modu Sheriff, former governor of Borno state, has denied claims that he accused Vice-President Kashim Shettima of creating Boko Haram .

NFL Week 10 Preview: Heavyweight NFC clashes on tap,"Week 10 in the NFL officially marks the beginning of the second half of the season, and it's also where we finally have a decent idea of who the true Super Bowl contenders are to watch in each conference. As luck would have it, the Week 10 slate gives us two matchups between NFC contenders in measuring stick games for all four clubs. Here's more on the two biggest matchups of the week, as well as some other key storylines to keep an eye on: Rams head to San Francisco with something to prove Take a look at the NFL Power Rankings this week, and in most of them, you'd find the Los Angeles Rams somewhere in the top three, if not the No. 1 spot. And with the way Matthew Stafford is playing right now, it's hard to argue against their spot at the top. In his 17th NFL season, Stafford leads the league with 21 passing touchdowns in eight games. In his past five games, the 37-year-old pivot has 1,408 yards, 16 TDs and zero interceptions, which has vaulted him right into the thick of the MVP conversation. But it's not just Stafford, as the Rams' defence has been doing its part, too. Over a three-game win streak, the Rams have allowed just 20 points total. Their last loss? A shocking overtime upset in Week 5 against their very opponent this weekend — the San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers have defied the odds all season. Devestated by injuries, head coach Kyle Shanahan has done a masterful job to keep his team not just afloat, but at 6-3, right in the race for a division title. Especially when you consider the 49ers are already 3-0 in NFC West division games, and have a chance to move to 4-0 on Sunday and take a real stranglehold on the in-division tiebreakers down the road. And just like they did when they stunned the Rams in Week 5, they'll once again lean on backup QB Mac Jones as Brock Purdy still appears a week away from returning to game action. But unlike in Week 5, this time San Francisco will be without the heart of its defence in linebacker Fred Warner, who is out for the season with an ankle injury. Conventional wisdom would say that this might be the week when the injuries finally catch up to the 49ers, especially with the roll the Rams are on right now. However, when these two teams play, nothing is a given. Per ESPN research, the 49ers' 26-23 OT win in Week 5 was the eighth game, including playoffs, between Shanahan and Rams head coach Sean McVay that has been decided by three points or less. That's the third most for any coaching matchup in NFL history. In other words, expect a tight one on Sunday. Packers looking to quiet the noise against Eagles It's not often you have a division leader this late in the season that could be described as ""desperate for a win."" But for the Green Bay Packers, that's exactly the case. At 5-2-1, the Packers are atop the NFC North, but have all three teams in their division breathing down their neck. They are also coming off a disappointing loss to the Carolina Panthers last Sunday, in which they lost star TE Tucker Kraft for the season with an ACL injury. Kraft was the Packers' most important offensive player outside of QB Jordan Love this season, as he led the team in both receiving yards (489) and touchdowns (6). It's a huge void to fill, especially on Monday against the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles in a rematch of last season's wild-card round. And unlike the Packers, the Eagles are only getting more dangerous. Philadelphia made three trades ahead of Tuesday's trade deadline to bolster its defence, most notably bringing in edge rusher Jaelan Phillips from Miami. It's a tall task for the Packers, but if they truly want to be considered a Super Bowl contender this season, they have to show they're up for it. Otherwise, the panic level in Green Bay is going to reach new highs this season. Sauce's Colts debut goes international While it doesn't usually bring the excitement as the trade deadline in other leagues, there were some notable moves at the NFL's on Tuesday. None bigger than the Indianapolis Colts showing that they're all in this season by acquiring star cornerback Sauce Gardner from the New York Jets. It's a dramatic change in circumstances for Gardner, who goes from competing for the No. 1 pick in next year's draft to competing for the No. 1 seed in the AFC with the 7-2 Colts. And he gets to make his debut on the international stage, as the Colts kick Sunday's action off bright and early with a matchup against the Atlanta Falcons in Berlin. It's a perfect matchup to see how exactly the Colts plan to deploy Gardner moving forward, as Drake London is the clear top option for the Falcons' passing game. Will London have a Gardner shadow all game, or will the Colts use their new weapon in a different capacity? Either way, it's an exciting time to be a Colts fan. Game to watch: New England Patriots (7-2) @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-2) — Sunday, 1 p.m. ET The New England Patriots are absolutely one of the shocking stories of the first half of the season. Second-year QB Drake Maye is playing at an MVP level, and his team is in the AFC East driver's seat 10 weeks into the season. But without taking anything away from the Patriots, their schedule hasn't exactly been a gauntlet up to this point. After an impressive Week 5 win over the Buffalo Bills, the Patriots rattled off another four wins against the Saints, Titans, Browns and Falcons. That's four wins against teams with a combined record of 7-27. But Week 10 brings an intriguing test for these upstart Patriots, as they head on the road to take on Baker Mayfield and the 6-2 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. If the Patriots come out on top in this one, there should be zero questions left about whether they can really compete for a championship this season. Forrest's favourites (Season record: 14-10 — All odds courtesy of BetMGM): Cardinals @ Seahawks — Pick: Cardinals +7: The Cardinals look much better with Jacoby Brissett at quarterback. In a division game, take the points and ride with Brissett and the Cardinals. Ravens @ Vikings — Pick: Ravens -4: Don't look now, but the Ravens look primed for a second-half run with a healthy Lamar Jackson. Look for them to make a statement against the Vikings. Eagles @ Packers — Pick: Eagles +1: As mentioned earlier, there is a lot working against the Packers in this one. So take the defending Super Bowl champs to win on the road.

Bustamante Hospital for Children receives major boost as critically ill patients are transferred from hurricane-hit hospitals in the west,"KINGSTON, Jamaica — As hospitals in the north and west continue to reel from the effects of Hurricane Melissa, the Sandals Foundation has injected $6-million worth of equipment and resources to help the Bustamante Hospital for Children accept and care for the critically ill neonates, babies, and children who are being transferred to Kingston. A suite of machines and supplies, including a neonatal ventilator, infusion pump, blood gas analyser, catheter, blood pressure machine, humidifier, nebuliser/ suction machine, IV Pole, exam light and more, have been purchased by the philanthropic arm of Sandals Resorts International – building the capacity of the island’s only specialist paediatric hospital. “Four of our island’s major paediatric centres have been affected by the hurricane, so here at the Bustamante Hospital for Children, we have made a commitment that we will take the paediatric surgical patients, because we have the surgical specialists, the neonates, and any other sub-specialties such as cardiology, renal patients, and more,” said Chief Medical Officer at the Bustamante Hospital for Children Dr Michelle-Ann Dawson. “It’s going to be difficult for parents because some may have to be separated temporarily from their families, but we are also looking at how we can support the parents with care packages, with information, dialogue, and psychological support,” continued Dawson. Within days of the island being hit by the category 5 storm, members of the philanthropic organisation were in dialogue with the Ministry of Health and Wellness to determine critical resources needed to strengthen the services and capacity that were anticipated. Executive Director at the Sandals Foundation, Heidi Clake, said, “Our children and healthcare are two areas that resonate with us, especially in times of emergency. Being able to work alongside the Ministry of Health and our doctors and nurses that are working round the clock to serve those most affected – we are very pleased to be able to hand over this equipment that we hope will help in the weeks ahead until our other hospitals are able to recover.” Within hours of receiving the equipment from local suppliers, Jamaica Hospital Supplies and Medical Link, Head of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), Dr Carmen ‘Cindy’ Rhoden, reported success in caring for a patient that was transferred from the west. “We are happy that with your donations yesterday, we were able to give the best care to a preterm neonate 26 weeks gestation weighing only 830g that we accepted last night,” she said. The Bustamante Hospital for Children is the only specialist paediatric hospital in the English-speaking Caribbean and Jamaica’s major referral hospital. The institution, which serves patients 0-12 years old, provides a wide range of services including cardiology, neurology, asthma/respiratory, nephrology, neurosurgery, urology, ophthalmology, cardio-thoracic, and dental. For Dr Sharon McLean-Salmon, paediatric haematologist oncologist, the donated supplies will also enhance the care of patients with cancers and serious blood disorders. “We have received two equipment which are essential for our team in terms of managing patients who are affected with cancer and who need intense monitoring to ensure that they are stable and doing well while receiving lifesaving treatment.” According to the United Nations, around 1.5 million Jamaicans have been impacted by the Category 5 storm, with seven parishes being the most significantly affected. The Bustamante Hospital in Kingston will provide a place of refuge for patients from the paediatric centres at the Savanna-la-Mar Public General Hospital in Westmoreland, the Black River Hospital in St Elizabeth, Cornwall Regional Hospital in St James, and the Falmouth Hospital in Trelawny. Representatives from the Sandals Foundation, the Bustamante Hospital for Children, Medical Link delivery team share a moment with a portion of the suite of equipment donated by the Sandals Foundation to build the capacity of the hospital to accept and care for critically ill patients being transferred from western affected hospitals.

Dear Abby: Woman isn’t seeing progress as she tries to distance herself from sociopathic liar,"DEAR ABBY: I just left a verbally and physically abusive relationship. I suffer from mental illness, and “Scott” made it worse. We lived together for almost four years. I could beat myself up over deciding to live with him. He’s an alcoholic, narcissistic, bipolar, sociopathic liar who swears he’s a man of God. Scott kicked me out countless times during the time we lived together, knowing I had nowhere to go. Five months ago was the last time. I still love him and care for him, but I learned last month that he met someone at AA and took her in. She had been living with him until yesterday. We were still “together” until two weeks ago but without any romantic encounters. I am torn to pieces over this man. It has taken me over and who I was as a person. Scott has a history of abuse. He has a criminal record for killing an animal when he was staying with someone. I didn’t stay clear of him because I was sucked in by his charm. I am now living with a friend and seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist who are doing NOTHING for me! Scott and I were engaged. We were going to get married pending his being sober for a year, which never happened. I don’t know what to do. Please help. -- BROKEN WING IN MINNESOTA DEAR BROKEN WING: As I read your letter, I hear the strains of Cole Porter’s “So in Love.” PLEASE look up the lyrics because they describe you accurately. What you need to do is continue talking with your therapist and getting meds from your psychiatrist until they help you undo your fixation on someone who, if your description of him is accurate, is a sociopath and incapable of loving ANYone.

Royal Family LIVE: Andrew faces major embarrassment this week as Parliament gets involved,"Andrew Mountbatten Windsor is set to face major embarrassment this week as a ban gets lifted by Parliament. The 65-year-old was stripped of his royal titles, including his princely title, and will soon leave the 30-room Royal Lodge, which has been his home since 2003. When Parliament returns from a brief recess on Tuesday, Liberal Democrat MPs will press the Government on Andrew’s Royal Lodge arrangements. As reported by The Times, this will include any advice being provided by ministers on the size of his payout for vacating the property. By convention, MPs are not allowed to criticise royals in the Commons. However, with recent news of the stripping of his title, Andrew is now a commoner. According to parliamentary officials, he has now lost any immunity from receiving scrutiny. WELCOME TO OUR LIVE BLOG. PLEASE FIND THE LATEST ROYAL UPDATES BELOW. King Charles's ""hot equerry"", Lieutenant Colonel Jonny Thompson, has made a new appearance today, and royal fans took notice. Major Jonny Thompson, often dubbed ""Major Eye Candy"" by royal fans for his brooding good looks, was carrying the King’s wreath on Remembrance Sunday during the poignant ceremony at the Cenotaph in London. Fans were delighted to see the King’s aide once again and took to social media to express their jubilation. Andrew Mountbatten Windsor is allegedly “terrified” to face the US Congress after the latest wave of humiliation, a royal expert has claimed. The disgraced brother of King Charles, who saw all his titles and honours axed by the King, has now been asked to appear before the House Oversight Committee for a ""transcribed interview"" in connection with his ""long-standing friendship"" with the convicted paedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. In the letter, sent to the former prince on Thursday, the US politicians said their committee had identified ""financial records containing notations such as 'massage for Andrew' that raise serious questions"". The letter was co-signed by 16 Democratic committee members. It requested a response by November 20. Now, royal expert Phil Dampier said that the letter is yet another “embarrassment” for the Royal Family, who want to move on from Andrew’s scandal. The Prince and Princess of Wales have issued a powerful and moving message following their attendance today at the annual Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph. King Charles led the nation in honouring those who have died in conflict in a touching ceremony in London, attended by thousands of veterans and senior members of the Royal Family. Following the ceremony, William and Kate took to their official social media account to post a poignant video of today’s events and share the message: “Each year it is an honour to take part in Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph in London alongside other members of the Royal Family and in front of veterans and their families. Lest We Forget.” Sarah Ferguson has not been dealing well with the aftermath of the latest bombshells regarding her links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and believes she is “blameless” despite the furore, sources have claimed. The former Duchess of York, who lost her title and her home, after her ex-husband, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, with whom she still lives at Royal Lodge, faced yet another fall from grace, after new details emerged of his relationship with the disgraced US financier, which led to the King stripping him of his titles and honours. A source close to her said the whole scandal has taken its toll on her, but she remains defiant, insisting she’s blameless in it all. EXCLUSIVE: After watching King Charles lead the nation in a two-minute silence to honour those who have died in conflict during Sunday's emotional Remembrance Day service, the monarch's wife, Queen Camilla, and Princess Kate struggled to keep their true feelings hidden. The pair watched the proceedings together from the balcony of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, overlooking the Cenotaph. They observed wreaths being laid by the King, his eldest son, Prince William, and other members of the royal family, alongside senior politicians and high commissioners from the Commonwealth of Nations. Good afternoon, I'm Sophia Papamavroudi and I'll be bringing you all the latest royal updates into this evening. Feel free to get in touch with me as I work at sophia.papamavroudi@reachplc.com Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were seen arriving hand-in-hand to celebrate Kris Jenner's 70th birthday on Saturday evening. The couple were two of the 300 guests in attendance, as the event was taking place at Jeff Bezos’s Beverly Hills estate. King Charles made an emotional appearance at today's Remembrance Day service at the Cenotaph in London. The 76-year-old appeared moved as he took part in a two-minute silence to remember the sacrifices of the many servicemen and women who gave their lives in service to their country. Prince George surprised royal fans last night when he stepped out with senior royals to attend the Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall. The young prince, 12, accompanied his mum, Princess Kate, to the event, where they joined King Charles, Queen Camilla and other members of the family. Sarah Ferguson's true feelings about Andrew have been unveiled, with the 66-year-old said to feel that she is ""blameless"". Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and Sarah - who is also known as Fergie - are set to leave Royal Lodge soon, but will reportedly live separately after having shared the 30-room mansion since 2003. King Charles is set to ""switch off from his personal dramas"" as he commemorates Remembrance Sunday today, according to former Royal butler Grant Harrold who served the King at Highgrove House. Harrold revealed that the late Queen Elizabeth II enforced a ""three line whip"" for The Firm on Remembrance Sunday, with many royals having served in the Armed Forces and the Queen's own uncle Fergus Bowes-Lyon tragically killed in action during the Battle of Loos. Meghan Markle has officially made a return to her acting roots by announcing her role in a new movie, which is being filmed in Pasadena, California. The 44-year-old has been pictured on set of the film Close Personal Friends looking ""very relaxed and happy"", according to a well-placed source. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle issued a major announcement on Saturday evening, minutes after the Royal Family made a poignant appearance in London to mark Remembrance Week.

US grounds MD-11 cargo planes after deadly crash,"Share Options WASHINGTON: The US civil aviation regulator ordered Saturday that all MD-11 cargo planes remain grounded for inspections, after one of them was involved in a deadly crash in Kentucky this week. A McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft operated by UPS exploded into flames when it crashed shortly after departing Tuesday from the airport in Louisville, killing at least 14 people. A three-person crew was aboard. Freight carriers UPS and FedEx later grounded their MD-11 fleets, while Boeing, which owns McDonnell Douglas, said it had recommended that all operators suspend their use of the planes. On Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency directive that “prohibits further flight until the airplane is inspected and all applicable corrective actions are performed.” The directive applies to the MD-11 and MD-11F models and says it “was prompted by an accident where the left-hand engine and pylon detached from the airplane during takeoff.” “The agency has determined the unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design,” it said. On Friday, UPS said it had decided to “temporarily ground” its MD-11s “out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of safety.” It said the model accounts for around nine percent of its fleet. FedEx said Saturday it, too, had grounded its 28 MD-11s out of a total fleet of around 700 aircraft as it conducts a safety review. Both carriers said they were acting on a recommendation from the plane’s manufacturer. McDonnell Douglas originally made the MD-11 but was acquired by Boeing in 1997. Boeing said it had “recommended to the three operators of the MD-11 Freighter that they suspend flight operations while additional engineering analysis is performed.” The only other carrier using the MD-11 is Western Global Airlines. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said another crash victim had been located, bringing the total number to 14. “Please pray for these families, the Louisville community and everyone affected by this terrible event,” he said on X. Trail of debris The plane, filled with around 38,000 gallons (144,000 liters) of fuel for the long-haul flight to Hawaii, narrowly missed a major Ford vehicle assembly plant that employs about 3,000 people. Aerial footage of the crash site showed a long trail of debris as firefighters doused the flames, with smoke billowing from the area. Todd Inman, a member of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said this week that investigators had identified the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder—known as a plane’s black boxes—and would send them to Washington for analysis. The crash was reportedly the deadliest in UPS history. Its main hub, Worldport, is in Louisville, where it employs thousands of people. According to the NTSB, the plane was built in 1991 and was modified into a cargo aircraft. The crash comes amid the longest government shutdown in US history, with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warning this week of “mass chaos” in the skies due to a lack of air traffic control staff. Inman said the NTSB was not aware of any staff shortages at Louisville’s airport at the time of the crash. — AFP Share Options",2025-11-09 08:04:00,Kuwait Times,negative,0.7303,-1,Outlier, Federal Aviation Administration orders all MD-11 cargo planes remain grounded for inspections .

Joe Vandal statue unveiled in front of Kibbie Dome,"The University of Idaho unveiled a statue of its mascot, Joe Vandal, in front of the P1FCU Kibbie Dome on Saturday prior to the team’s football game against UC Davis. The 9-foot-tall statue with a 5-foot-wide base and weighing approximately 2,000 pounds is a way that UI is recognizing its Associated Students of Idaho (ASUI). The group is known for its decades-long support for the Kibbie Dome and other campus resources and facilities. “As we celebrate our 50th year in the P1FCU Kibbie Dome, it’s fitting to add a tribute to the University of Idaho students and their contributions to this facility,” University of Idaho President C. Scott Green said. “The Dome has become a beloved gathering place for students, alumni and our entire community, that would not exist without the steadfast support of our students.” In 1974, the ASUI voted to allocate student fees to add a roof to the dome and make other improvements to what is now a nationally recognized landmark on the Moscow campus. Also honored at the event were ASUI President Seyi Arogundade and artist and sculptor Gareth Curtiss. Curtiss collaborated with Idaho students, alumni, employees and community members to create and refine the design of the statue. “While leaning into the future, Vandals honor decades of student support,” Green said on Monday in a news release. “We look forward to unveiling this symbol of the Vandal spirit as a timeless monument to the generous contributions of our Vandal student body, past and present.” Green said that the Kibbie Dome, which has been built with the help of student fees, is important to UI history and has helped host many events that the University puts on. “We appreciate the thousands of students who contributed student fees over the years to make the Dome a reality,” Green said. “We’re proud that this stadium is not just a football venue, it’s a world-class indoor track and field stadium, it hosts our Vandal soccer games, a variety of intramural sports, our commencement ceremonies and many other events throughout the year.” Junt can be reached at 208-848-2258, tjunt@lmtribune.com or on X (formerly Twitter) @TrevorJunt.",2025-11-09 08:04:00,Dnews,neutral,0.5929,25,Idaho_To_Maddox, The University of Idaho unveiled a statue of its mascot Joe Vandal in front of the P1FCU Kibbie Dome on Saturday .

How Nigeria can tackle crude oil theft- Ned Nwoko,"South West November 9, 2025 by Innocent Duru Chairman of the Senate Ad Hoc Committee on Crude Oil Theft and Sabotage, Senator Ned Nwoko raised concerns about the menace of crude oil in the country and suggested how the challenge can be addressed. Nwoko disclosed this while presenting the committee’s interim report before the Senate. He said: “Our investigation has so far uncovered massive revenue losses amounting to over $300 billion in unaccounted crude oil proceeds over the years. This represents one of the most troubling cases of economic sabotage our nation has ever faced.” The committee, he said, has “made far-reaching recommendations to end this long-standing menace.

"Asking Eric: Is it weird to announce our divorce, change in names in holiday cards?","Dear Eric: My dilemma is about Christmas cards. I am separated from my husband of 25 years, and while it’s mostly amicable, I feel disingenuous including him on the card this year. Our divorce will be final less than a month after Christmas. I am also going back to my maiden name so I thought it might be a good way to announce that as well. We share four children (and a cat) who I’d like to include. Any ideas on wording that is classy or funny to express this new family identity that doesn’t skew weird or inappropriate? – I’d Still Like to Wish You a Merry Christmas Dear Merry Christmas: Hmm, this was an interesting challenge. Perhaps something like “There’s a new name, and a new family arrangement, but the warm wishes are the same.” Or you could lean into a seasonal motif: “This holiday, we’re moving into a new season of life, so you’ll see a different name on the return address but know that my love for you lasts year-round.” Or funny: “Is it regifting when Santa brings you your maiden name for Christmas?” Perhaps follow that last one up with a sincere sentence or two to reassure folks that everyone is happy and healthy. There’s also a simple solution of taking a photo of yourself with your kids and cat, signing it with your maiden name, and letting people infer or speak to you directly if they want more information. There are some who advise against announcing divorces in holiday greetings because divorce can be sad. However, it’s your card and your life and you don’t have to hide it. Holiday cards and letters often encompass the full breadth of what goes on in a year – love, loss, and all the rest. So, if you want to share it, do. Readers, I invite you to improve upon my work. If you’ve written or received other holiday greetings from folks announcing a divorce, please send it in. I’ll publish some of them in a column next month so that you can put them to use in future years. Dear Eric: We have given Christmas gifts to eight of our son’s friends since middle school. I recently retired and do not make the kind of money I used to. I want to tactfully tell them that I love them all dearly but need to stop gifting. They do not gift us, nor do I ever see them open their gifts. So, I really don’t get the joy out of it anymore. Can you help? —Gift Giver Dear Giver: You’re basically already there with what you’ve written to me. A card or note that tells them you love them all dearly but that your circumstances are changing and so you need to end the tradition should suffice. You can even say less if you’d like and just send them a card that announces, “we’re switching to cards for Christmas. Still love you lots!” Send questions to R.

"Retired from the Navy, but still plenty busy","From jamming enemy radar in the Persian Gulf to running chili feeds at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post in Lewiston, Navy veteran Rockey A. Davis stays busier than a deckhand on swabbing duty. Much of his life’s work always kept him close to the ocean, even nowadays living near this nation’s farthest inland seaport. “When I was a service officer, the St. Maries veterans all said they moved there because they wanted to get away from the water,” says the 73-year-old Davis with a laugh. He doesn’t mind the ocean one way or the other, but he doesn’t miss it after being deployed five times on five different aircraft carriers: the USS Kitty Hawk, the USS Forrestal, the USS Nimitz, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the USS Abraham Lincoln. He retired in 1995 with the rank of aviation electrician’s mate senior chief, after seeing action during conflicts across the world. While most Americans watched the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis play out on the nightly news, Davis was a young sailor on the USS Kitty Hawk, which was sent to the North Arabian Sea to support air operations. The crisis began after Iranian students overran the U.S. embassy, taking 66 U.S. citizens hostage and holding 52 of them for 444 days. To Davis and his crewmates, the situation felt tense. “All of the sudden there were T-shirts saying, ‘Nuke ’em till they glow,’ ” Davis recalls. Davis had other deployments in that part of the world during times of conflict. He was also there to help enforce the no-fly zone in the Persian Gulf after Gulf War One. During that time, he worked with radar-jamming missions that ended up with the bombing of surface-to-air missile sites. He says he didn’t feel threatened despite the deadly warfare. “I felt safe,” Davis says. “We had fighters and aggressive aircraft, bombers.” Comfort with weapons has translated to his community service work. Davis volunteers at the Lewis-Clark Wildlife Club’s public shooting range east of Lapwai on Tom Beall Road. He works as a range officer there, helping take care of the facility. He also volunteers on his church’s security team, carrying a weapon and creating plans in case the church is attacked. “Everyone on our security team is armed,” he says. Davis and his wife have two kids, who also served in the military. He had a second career as a veterans service officer for the state of Idaho for 10 years. Today he is in his second year as commander of VFW Post 10043, which has 359 members, making it the state’s second-largest post behind Boise. Recently, he started partnering with Serengeti Care of Lewiston to help raise money for people who need home health services. The first fundraiser was a chili cookoff in October. The VFW will host a bakeoff this month.

Inside Britain's 'poshest' hospital with unlimited caviar and Andy Warhol art,"The UK's most luxurious hospital has opened its doors in London, boasting unlimited caviar and Andy Warhol artwork adorning the walls – with stays setting you back a cool £750 per night. Memorial Houston Medical (MhM) is pioneering a ""design-first approach"" to medical recovery - referencing studies which suggest that patients exposed to art experience improved recovery rates. The post-op facility, originally established in Texas, believes the scientific field of ""neuroaesthetics"", which explores how the brain reacts to beauty and art, is fundamental to its design. Read more: Police get special Birmingham city centre powers Patients recuperating from cancer treatment, cardiology procedures, hip replacements, and diabetic foot disease, among other conditions, can convalesce in one of the building's six patient suites or three outpatient rooms - featuring artwork such as a £50,000 Andy Warhol portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. According to the hospital chiefs, the facility, which opened earlier this year, provides ""five-star standards"" in a former jewellery shop, situated on Fulham Road, South Kensington. Art from Warhol, Sir Peter Blake, and José María García graces the walls throughout the building, while Lebanese haute couture designer Elie Saab has provided specially commissioned furniture. A 15-ft ceiling mural depicting the streets and waterways of London in gold leaf embellishes the top floor – while meals are served on bespoke crockery designed by Lebanese ceramicist Helen Zughaib. The building boasts materials such as calcutta marble, bronzed brass, and eucalyptus wood. The design features are said to ""create aesthetic balance"" for patients during their recovery. Those seeking treatment at the centre will be charged £750 per night, which includes a three-course dinner and afternoon tea, with a family member allowed to stay with the patient at no extra cost. A physiotherapist is also available on-site at a rate of £200 per hour, while minor procedures including a vitamin B12 injection (£80) and dermal fillers (starting from £250) are also on offer. Danny Shebaclo, vice president of business affairs at MhM, commented: ""The opening of our inpatient services marks an extraordinary milestone, not only for MhM but for the evolution of healthcare in the UK. ""Our vision is to offer a deeply considered, human-first approach to medicine, where design, dignity, and medical innovation come together. ""We are proud to offer the UK a facility where patients are cared for with world-class expertise, total discretion, and unparalleled comfort."" Amy Forrest, senior architect at LSI Architects, who were involved in the building's transformation, stated: ""This was about more than aesthetics. ""It was about crafting spaces that actively participate in the patient's healing process. ""From the material palette to spatial volume and lighting, every detail has been guided by how it makes the patients feel.""",2025-11-09 08:04:00,Birmingham Live,positive,0.8557,-1,Outlier," Memorial Houston Medical is pioneering a ""design-first approach"" to medical recovery .

AP Sports SummaryBrief at 3:08 p.m. EST,"MLB pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz charged with taking bribes to rig pitches for bettors NEW YORK (AP) — Two Major League Baseball pitchers have been indicted on charges they took bribes to give sports bettors advance notice of the types of pitches they’d throw and intentionally tossed balls instead of strikes to ensure successful bets. Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz both pitched for the Cleveland Guardians. They have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July while Major League Baseball investigated what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when they pitched. A lawyer for Ortiz declined to comment when contacted by The Associated Press and a lawyer for Clase did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Paul Tagliabue, NFL commissioner of 17 years who led an era of riches and expansion, dies at 84 NEW YORK (AP) — Paul Tagliabue, who helped bring labor peace and riches to the NFL during his 17 years as commissioner but was criticized for not taking stronger action on concussions, died Sunday from heart failure at 84 years old. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Tagliabue’s family informed the league of his death in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Tagliabue, who had developed Parkinson’s disease, was commissioner from 1989, when he succeeded Pete Rozelle, to 2006. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of a special centennial class in 2020. Current Commissioner Roger Goodell succeeded Tagliabue. Donald Trump plans to be the 1st sitting US president at a regular-season NFL game since 1978 LANDOVER, Md. (AP) — Extra security measures are in place before the Washington Commanders’ game against the Detroit Lions, where President Donald Trump planned to become the first sitting president in nearly a half-century to attend a regular-season NFL contest. Officers in black secret uniforms identifying them as members of the U.S. Secret Service joined military, police and other guards inside and outside Northwest Stadium on Sunday. There were more fences than usual blocking sidewalks and some pathways were restricted. Only two other times did a president go to an NFL game during the regular season while in office, according to the league: Richard Nixon in 1969 and Jimmy Carter in 1978.

Man City crushes Liverpool 3-0 in Pep Guardiola's 1,000th game MANCHESTER, England (AP) — In his 1000th game as a manager, Pep Guardiola celebrated victory as if it was his first. Manchester City’s 3-0 win against Liverpool was number 716 for Guardiola and likely one of his most satisfying of his trophy-laden career. Not only did City totally dominate the defending Premier League champion and one of Guardiola’s fiercest rivals in a career spanning Spain, Germany and England - but victory firmly established his team as the one most likely to run Arsenal closest for the title this season. City moved up to second in the standings - just four points behind the leader, with a well-established record when it comes to chasing down Arsenal. Taylor runs for 244 yards and 3 TDs for Colts in 31-25 OT win over Falcons in Berlin BERLIN (AP) — Jonathan Taylor completed a 244-yard rushing day with an 8-yard touchdown run in overtime to give the Indianapolis Colts a 31-25 victory over the Atlanta Falcons in the first regular-season NFL game in Berlin, Germany. It was Taylor’s third touchdown of the game and came after Colts kicker Michael Badgley tied the game with a 44-yard field goal with 25 seconds left. Tyler Allgeier’s second touchdown was a 1-yard plunge that give the Falcons a 25-22 lead with 1:44 left in regulation. McLaren driver Lando Norris wins Formula 1's Brazilian Grand Prix SAO PAULO (AP) — McLaren driver Lando Norris has significantly extended his lead in the F1 championship after winning the Brazilian Grand Prix. His main rival and teammate Oscar Piastri received a 10-second penalty and again failed to make the podium. Norris also won Saturday’s sprint race and started from pole position. He earned his first win at Interlagos with Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen second and third. Norris now has 390 points in the standings, with Piastri’s fifth place leaving him 24 points behind on 366 with three more races to go. Four-time world champion Verstappen has 341 points. Madrid stumbles again with 0-0 draw at Rayo Vallecano in Spanish league MADRID (AP) — Real Madrid has been held by Rayo Vallecano to a 0-0 draw in the Spanish league for its second consecutive setback following a Champions League loss at Liverpool. Madrid’s attack struggled and was scoreless again after having found the net in every match this season until the 1-0 loss at Liverpool on Tuesday. Madrid remains top of the Spanish league. It's five points ahead of second-placed Villarreal but Barcelona can move within three points of the leader by beating Celta Vigo later Sunday. Packers couldn't stop Eagles' tush push during offseason. Now they'll try to contain it on the field GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — The Green Bay Packers couldn’t thwart the tush push during the offseason. Now they must try to find a way to stop it in a game. Green Bay proposed a ban on the play during the offseason. The measure was approved by more than two-thirds of the teams but fell two votes short of passage. That has enabled the Philadelphia Eagles to continue using the short-yardage play in their Super Bowl title defense. The Eagles beat the Packers twice last season and face them again Monday night at Lambeau Field. Sauce Gardner laments misses in Colts debut, but loves 'electric' locker room after win BERLIN (AP) — Indianapolis Colts cornerback Sauce Gardner was thinking about a pick-6. It would have been quite a debut with his new team. He jumped a route but Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr.’s pass intended for Drake London went through Gardner’s hands, hit his midsection and bounced incomplete. He says “I was trying to score, so I was already looking at the end zone.” Still, the Colts left Berlin with a 31-25 overtime victory over Indianapolis that will soothe Gardner’s disappointment. It’s the type of play the Colts were hoping for when they traded two first-round draft picks and receiver Adonai Mitchell to the New York Jets on Tuesday to get one of the league’s premier cover cornerbacks.

"Live: Wall Street edges higher after volatile session, ASX set to rise","Topic:Stock Market The ASX is enjoying a solid start to the week, with shares closing up around 0.8 per cent higher thanks to demand for gold and lithium stocks. ANZ jumped more than 3 per cent despite posting a 10 per cent slide in profit, while RBA deputy governor Andrew Hauser's ""hawkish"" comments have strengthened the case against rate cuts in the short-term. Look back on how the session unfolded, plus financial news and insights from our specialist business reporters on our blog. Disclaimer: this blog is not intended as investment advice. By Stephen Letts Prices current around 4:15pm AEDT Live updates on the major ASX indices: By Stephen Letts That's it for another day on the blog, thanks for your company. The ASX 200 enjoyed its best day in three weeks, with perhaps the most surprising performance being ANZ's 3.2% jump on announcing 14% slide in cash profits, which was at best in-line with consensus forecasts and result some analysts described as ""messy"". It was not such a great day for former ANZ boss Shayne Elliott who forfeited $13.5 million in bonuses on the back of number of expensive regulatory ""issues"" the bank had with ASIC. Gold jumped back above $US4,000/ounce sparking a rally in local miners, while lithium, uranium and rare earth miners also jumped. Looking ahead, Wall Street looks likely to benefit from the news that the US senate had passed a bill to end the federal government shutdown. S&P 500 futures are up 0.7%, Nasdaq futures point to a 1.2% gain. However, there are still a few more hurdles, including White House approval, before furloughed workers can get back on the tools. We'll be back bright and early tomorrow morning with all the developments to set you up for another captivating day viewed through the eyes of the ABC business unit. Missing you already, until next time ... By Stephen Letts The ASX 200 enjoyed a strong day, gaining across the session to close 0.75% higher at 8,836 points. It was the index's best day in three weeks. The broad-based industrial sector was a standout, supported by solid rises in Monadelphous (+11.1%) and Austal (+5.2%), while speciality miners, the tech and financial sectors were also in demand. The supermarkets were largely out of favour, while property was dragged down by sector heavyweight Goodman Group slipping 1.3% and Centuria (-2.2%). The miners were a mixed bag, with the big iron ore producers underperforming (honourable mention to Rio Tinto, up 0.6%) after another drop in their spot prices out of China on Friday. Gold miners were uniformly back in town as their spot price jumped back above $US4,000/ounce. Lithium producers did even better with Liontown Resources up almost 13%. Uranium miners were also in the money, with the key players up between 6-to-10%. Banks and insurers were generally higher. ANZ (+3.2%) led the ""big four"" retail banks after posting full-year results this morning, while QBE insurance gained 1.3% on a broker upgrade. Macquarie Group (+0.6%) retraced some of its sharp 5% sell off on Friday. Tech stocks made late gains after a slow start. By sector, non-cyclical consumer stocks (aka the supermarkets) were the weakest. The top movers on the ASX 200 include Liontown Resources, mining services outfit Monadelphous on strong results and positive guidance, as well as a host of uranium miners. Dyno Nobel (+7.9%) also did well after a well-received full-year result. The ASX bottom movers include property settlements platform PEXA (-4.3%) and property group, Centuria Capital (-2.2%). By Stephen Letts Having a bit of DroneShield moment on the blog at the moment. Eagle-eyed reader Craig points out Nasdaq futures are up a stonking 1.2%, which is correct, not the 0.2% decline I tapped out. Thanks Craig. By Stephen Letts The big news in the US at the moment is that the Senate has advanced a bill aimed at ending the 40-day (so far) federal government shutdown. Reaction on Wall Street has been mixed, with S&P 500 and Dow futures pointing to solid gains tonight, while the Nasdaq looks like enduring another retreat. At 3:50pm (AEDT): By Stephen Letts What impact has the Suncorp Bank acquisition had on ANZ's results? - Andy Smith Hi Andy, Suncorp received a mention in the ""September Half 2025 Significant Items"" summary along with the likes of staff redundancies (after-tax charge of $414 million), the ASIC settlement (after-tax charge of $261 million) and the PT Panin impairment (after-tax charge of $285 million). ANZ had already flagged last month plans to complete the integration of Suncorp Bank by June 2027 to ""accelerate value creation for shareholders"". In its accounts, ANZ recognised an after-tax charge of $68 million in relation to the Suncorp migration ... to the bank, sort of like the change you or I would lose under the couch, and it hasn't cracked a mention in the analyst reports that have come across the blog's desk today. By Stephen Letts The Australian dollar is off on a bit of a frolic this afternoon, jollied along by hopes the US federal government shutdown may soon be over, as well as fairly ""hawkish"" comments from RBA deputy governor Andrew Hauser. The Aussie is currently up 0.4% to 65.16 US cents (at 3:20pm AEDT). This follows its 0.8% slide last week. ""It does look as though the Aussie is taking heart from the apparent end to the US political stalemate that is boosting US equity futures in anticipation of a rebound in the US economy,"" ITC senior analyst Sean Callow said. ""RBA's Hauser may have also helped the Aussie at the margin, with his comments reinforcing the hawkish lean of the November meeting."" In a speech in Sydney, Hauser noted the starting point for Australia's economic recovery last year was the tightest in more than 40 years, suggesting little urgency to ease policy soon. He later said financial conditions are closer to neutral rates now. ""This was a further hawkish evolution of the RBA's characterisation at the November (Statement on Monetary Policy),"" NAB senior economist Taylor Nugent wrote in a note. ""NAB expects the RBA to be firmly on hold before a final cut in May 2026, but risks are skewed to a 3.6% terminal cash rate for the cycle."" With Reuters By Stephanie Chalmers Reserve Bank deputy governor Andrew Hauser was in conversation with UBS chief economist George Tharenou at the investment bank's conference in Sydney today. Now Mr Tharenou and his economics team have released a note with their take on the chat. The headline? Hauser was on the hawkish side, UBS concludes. ""This was consistent with the UBS view that the RBA will hold the cash rate unchanged ahead, with a terminal rate of 3.6%,"" the note read. ""Looking forward, we think the RBA's assessment is increasingly that the outlook for inflation depends on the balance of supply and demand. In economic terms — the 'output gap', or 'spare capacity'… ""We discussed various scenarios, but Hauser cited 'credence' to the hawkish scenario, 'fearing that the economy may find itself boxed in by its own capacity constraints, like a racehorse trapped against the course fence, unable to surge forward. On that view, there may be little scope for demand growth to rise further without adding to inflationary pressures, and hence there may be little room for further policy easing.'"" By Stephen Letts It was shaping up as another heady day for ASX 200 newbie and investor sweetheart DroneShield, bouncing out of the blocks with shares up 9% on news of $7.6 million dollars' worth of new contracts with the US government. A couple of hours later, DroneShield sheepishly withdrew the statement, noting the same contracts had previously been announced in September. DroneShield duly plummeted back to earth and is now down 0.5% in the day. Clunk. In its follow-up statement to the ASX, DroneShield said the mistake was ""inadvertent"" and the company ""is taking steps to prevent this error occurring again"". By Stephen Letts Former ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott has paid a hefty price for the bank's run-in with ASIC over its mistreatment of customers and misconduct relating to trading in Australian government bonds. The ANZ's annual report released with its result this morning show Mr Elliott was ""not eligible"" for his long-term bonus payment of $13.49 million. Mr Elliot left the bank in May and was replaced by Nuno Matos. The ANZ board's chair of the people and culture committee, Holly Kramer, noted in the executive remuneration report that the bank was ""mindful"" of shareholder feedback in the strike it received against its 2024 remuneration report. Along with Mr Elliott, three former executives, including the former head of the Australian retail banking operations, Maile Carnegie, saw their share bonuses, which were due to vest later this year, forfeited. In Ms Carnegie's case, the cost was $4.4 million. ""The board determined that some or all equity due to vest in November/December 2025 would be forfeited to ensure overall consequences were appropriate and proportionate,"" Ms Kramer said. The total penalties ANZ racked up with ASIC over four different matters came in at $240 million — the highest in Australian corporate history — including the ""unconscionable conduct"" on a major commonwealth bond deal, and misconduct affecting about 65,000 customers. UBS bank analyst John Storey described the senior executives forfeiting parts of variable compensation as ""a positive on cultural change"" at the bank. By Michael Janda Marc Sumerlin, a former George W Bush economic adviser who has been in the mix of candidates for US Federal Reserve chair, says the two biggest risks to the US economic outlook are a weakening jobs market and the risk of an AI bubble. ""I think the biggest risks are: the economy's just weaker than we think and we're behind the curve, and we can observe that the unemployment rate has been drifting up for two years,"" he told journalists at a media roundtable (it was actually a rectangular table) at the UBS investment conference this morning. ""So no-one knows what [the] neutral [interest rate] is but we know we've been above neutral just by that ... So that's the biggest risk. ""And then the second biggest risk is that, on the other side, we do not have a credit bubble yet, we have high valuations, but if we make monetary policy too easy, we could be inflating the bubble."" Sumerlin said most AI investment so far has come from corporate cashflows, but it looks like the next wave of mega investments will require debt funding, raising broader financial sector risks. ""We don't have the debt acceleration yet, but it feels like we're at the start of it,"" he warned. Sumerlin also pointed to the wealth effect in the US keeping consumption high, but that could collapse if wealth suddenly started to evaporate. ""It's very difficult to have a recession in the US when the stock market is up, but if the stock market drops 20% we could be extremely vulnerable,"" he cautioned.

By Michael Janda Marc Sumerlin, once an economic adviser to former US president George W Bush and currently the managing partner of consultancy Evenflow Macro, is out in Sydney as part of the UBS conference. Sumerlin confirmed several months ago that he is in the mix of candidates being considered to replace Jerome Powell as the next US Federal Reserve chair. This morning he held an on-the-record discussion with a small group of financial journalists, myself included. I asked him why Donald Trump's tariffs didn't appear to be having as much upwards effect on US inflation as many analysts feared and whether they would put more pressure on price levels next year. ""They're a tax. To the extent they're borne by the consumer, the consumer is going to have lower after-tax income. And so, a year out, inflation should be lower in my mind,"" he responded. Sumerlin says the tariffs currently in place are the equivalent of a 1% of GDP tax on Americans, worth about $US300 billion in additional revenue. From an inflationary perspective, he's more worried about the tax cuts legislated by the Trump administration, which are also equivalent to about 1% of US GDP and take effect next year. ""We have a tax cut coming next year. So the One Big Beautiful Bill didn't change taxes in 2025 but it does in 2026. So you would have to be thinking about ... how much of a fiscal push you have coming and whether that would provide the income to have more inflation."" However, overall, Sumerlin believes a weakening US jobs market, a stagnant housing market (including rents), and stable to falling oil prices should keep inflation under control, even if the Fed cuts interest rates a little bit further.

Mining and energy stocks remain among some of the best performers so far, while ANZ is outperforming its banking peers, with shares up 2.3% despite reporting a 10% profit drop. The best performing stock so far: And the worst performers: By Stephanie Chalmers In some breaking news out of Washington DC, the US Senate has moved towards a vote on a bill that would end the federal government shutdown, now in its 40th day — the longest in history. Senators were set to vote on Sunday night, local time, on advancing a bill passed by the House of Representatives that will be amended to combine the short-term funding measure, which would fund the government through to January 2026, with a package of three full-year appropriations bills, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said. The amended package would still have to be passed by the House of Representatives and sent to US President Donald Trump for his signature, a process that could take several days. It comes as unpaid federal workers have told ABC News of turning to food banks or draining their savings to get by, while thousands of flights have been delayed or cancelled. You can read more from Reuters on the developing story: By Stephanie Chalmers In good news for anyone forecasting another interest rate cut this cycle, which we should note includes some of the major bank economists, the RBA's deputy governor doesn't think you're completely off your rocker! ""There are still worlds you could imagine where rates are cut,"" Andrew Hauser said in Sydney, speaking at the UBS Australasia Conference. Mr Hauser spoke about whether Australia's economy was ""boxed in"" by capacity constraints or whether it could ""break free"" through higher productivity. On the topic of whether there are further interest rate cuts to come, Mr Hauser said for that to happen you'd have to think that there's more spare capacity than current data suggests, or be pessimistic about the outlook for demand growth, or think that capacity pressures only have a weak effect on inflation. ""The CPI number we've obviously seen come out is a challenge for that view,"" Mr Hauser said. ""You'd have to believe that most of it was a one-off, volatile … recovery that was shortly going to unwind. ""You'd probably take a view about the labour market, that it was weaker and looser than our central projection. ""GDP you could be pessimistic about, consumer confidence in Australia is pretty weak, and you could of course worry about the world … tariffs may still prove to have more of an effect."" Mr Hauser noted that tariff effects that could still potentially play out could be China flooding the Australian market with cheap goods, putting downward pressure on inflation, or financial markets repricing downwards. ""I don't think you have to be mad, or sort of a fanatic, to think that future rate cuts could be coming. ""More plausibly, perhaps, at the moment, you might worry about how much remaining room there is."" You can read more from Mr Hauser's prepared remarks (below) from David Taylor: By Stephen Letts The ASX 200 has opened 0.2% higher with buying evident across most sectors (at 11am AEDT). The broad-based industrial sector is the standout, supported by strong gains in DroneShield (+8.7%), Monadelphous (+8.2%) and Austal (+4.2%), while the mining and financial sectors are also in demand. The supermarkets, utilities and property trusts are out of favour this morning. The miners are a mixed bag, with the big iron ore producers underperforming after another drop in their spot prices out of China on Friday. Lithium producers are the big movers in the mining sector this morning, with Liontown Resources up almost 9%. Uranium miners are also doing well, which is supporting the energy sector. Banks and insurers are generally higher, with ANZ (+0.5%) leading the ""big four"" retail banks after posting full-year results this morning, while QBE insurance is up 1.8%. Macquarie Group (+1.6%) has retraced some of its sharp 5% sell off on Friday. In the consumer non-cyclical sector, most of the supermarkets are out of favour, with both Coles and Woolworths down around 1%. The top movers on the ASX 200 include Liontown Resources, mining services outfit Monadelphous on strong results and positive guidance, and DroneShield after announcing another defence contract in the US. Dyno Nobel is also doing well after a well-received full-year result. The ASX bottom movers include Seek (-2.4%) and fuel retailer and refiner Viva Energy (-1.5%). By Stephen Letts It may be baby steps, but it seems the US Senate may be heading towards breaking the deadlock that has shut down federal agencies for the past 40 days. Reuters is reporting that the Senate moved towards a vote on reopening the federal government. Here's what's just popped up on the wires: Senators plan to vote on advancing a House-passed stopgap funding bill as early as Sunday evening (Monday morning AEDT), with the understanding that it would be amended to combine a short-term funding measure with a package of three full-year appropriations bills, said Senate Majority Leader John Thune. The amended package would still have to be passed by the House of Representatives and sent to US President Donald Trump for his signature, a process that could take several days. Senate Democrats so far have resisted efforts to pass a funding measure, aiming to pressure Republicans to agree to healthcare fixes that would include extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Under the deal being discussed, the Senate would agree to hold a separate vote later on the subsidies. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, told reporters that he would vote against the funding measure but suggested there could be enough Democratic support to pass it. ""I am unwilling to accept a vague promise of a vote at some indeterminate time, on some undefined measure that extends the healthcare tax credits,"" Mr Blumenthal said. Sunday marked the 40th day of the shutdown, which has sidelined federal workers and affected food aid, parks and travel, while air-traffic control staffing shortages threaten to derail travel during the busy Thanksgiving holiday season later this month. Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, said the mounting effects of the shutdown have pushed the chamber towards an agreement. He said the final piece, a new resolution that would fund government operations into late January, would also reverse at least some of the Trump administration's mass layoffs of federal workers. ""Temperatures cool, the atmospheric pressure increases outside and all of a sudden it looks like things will come together,"" Mr Tillis told reporters. Should the government remain closed for much longer, economic growth could turn negative in the fourth quarter, especially if air travel does not return to normal levels by Thanksgiving, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett warned on the CBS's Face the Nation show. Thanksgiving falls on November 27 this year. Reuters By Stephen Letts The first takes on ANZ's full-year results are rolling in and it's fair to say they are not glowing. Brisbane-based broker Morgans described the result as ""messy"". J.P.

College football rankings REVEALED: Huge shake-up as Texas returns to top 10 and BYU tumbles,"Texas returned to the top 10 of The Associated Press college football poll on Sunday, after a wild weekend saw 19 of the top 25 positions change hands. The Longhorns, the preseason No. 1 team, are ranked No. 10 in advance of its visit to No. 5 Georgia this week. They had been in the top 10 for the first six polls before their loss at Florida knocked them out of the Top 25 for a week. Four straight wins elevated them to No. 13 last week, and they jumped three spots ahead of BYU and Virginia and an idle Oklahoma, which they beat 23-6 on Oct. 11. Texas did not play over the weekend. The Atlantic Coast Conference, meanwhile, has five teams ranked for the first time this season, and two Group of Five conferences are now represented in the Top 25 a month before the playoff bracket is set. Ohio State was No. 1 for the 11th week in a row with 55 first-place votes. Indiana remained No. 2 after its narrow escape at Penn State, but the Hoosiers' six first-place votes were five fewer than last week. No. 3 Texas A&M got four first-place votes, three more than a week ago, and was 31 points behind Indiana. Alabama and Georgia rounded out the top five. Mississippi, Oregon, Texas Tech, Notre Dame and Texas rounded out the top 10. Indiana's Omar Cooper produced a miraculous catch to secure victory over Penn State Texas Tech (whose fans are pictured) beat BYU in a huge top-15 match-up in Lubbock In all, 19 spots in the Top 25 have new teams. The ACC has five teams with one loss in conference play and two others with two losses. That's reflected in the closely bunched group of ACC teams in the poll - No. 14 Georgia Tech, No. 16 Miami, No. 19 Louisville, No. 20 Virginia and No. 23 Pittsburgh. The last time the ACC had as many ranked teams was Nov. 3, 2024. The race for the Group of Five's automatic bid in the College Football Playoff got more interesting with Memphis' loss to Tulane on Friday.

Man City show their potential by capping big week with signature win over Liverpool,"Mark Ogden debates Man City's title credentials after closing the gap on Arsenal to four points. (1:03) MANCHESTER, England -- Manchester City laid down a marker in the Premier League title race with an impressive 3-0 win over reigning champions Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Erling Haaland saw an early penalty saved before giving City a deserved lead midway through the first half with a well-taken header. Virgil van Dijk thought he'd equalized only for his header to be ruled out because Andrew Robertson was deemed to be offside in front of Gianluigi Donnarumma. City made the most of their first-half dominance when Nico González got it to 2-0 just before halftime with a shot from outside the penalty area that deflected in off Van Dijk, and Jérémy Doku rounded off his man-of-the-match performance with a spectacular goal in the second half. The result moves City up to second in the table as they closed the gap on leaders Arsenal to four points after Mikel Arteta's side had to settle for a draw against Sunderland on Saturday. -- Rob Dawson It has been hard to tell where City are at after a mixed start to the season, but this week has revealed that they're actually pretty good. Pep Guardiola's team have seen off AFC Bournemouth, Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool in the space of seven days. More than that, all three performances were relatively convincing. The first half against Liverpool was maybe their best 45 minutes of the season. It might have been their best 45 minutes since the 2023-24 season. Guardiola has been careful to play down expectations after a miserable campaign in 2024-25, but they're keeping up with the UEFA Champions League pacesetters at the top of the league phase table; sit second in the Premier League, four points behind leaders Arsenal; and have an EFL Cup quarterfinal to come against Brentford next month. It's a case of so far, so good. There's a long way to go this season -- something Guardiola pointed out himself at his news conference Friday. All City can do is put themselves in a position to challenge for trophies in the new year, and they're well on their way to doing that. Liverpool might not be at the level that saw them crowned champions six months ago, but it was still a statement win. -- Dawson Perhaps the most fitting encapsulation of Liverpool's tumultuous season so far was provided in the second half at the Etihad, when the home supporters turned their backs on the action and did the iconic ""Poznan"" celebration. For Arne Slot's side, the sight of its longstanding rival basking in such an emphatic win represents a new nadir in a campaign that has lurched from the sublime to the ridiculous. After a promising week in which the Reds beat both Aston Villa and Real Madrid, Sunday's clash against a resurgent City simply proved a bridge too far. Ultimately, this was a game lost in the first half, with Liverpool unable to replicate the quality and intensity that helped them see off Madrid so impressively in midweek. Slot might well point to the fact that fortune did not favor his side; City's early penalty (which was well saved by Giorgi Mamardashvili) seemed like a harsh decision, while Van Dijk's controversial disallowed goal -- which would have made it 1-1 in the first half -- undoubtedly swung the momentum in City's favor. Still, the fact of the matter is that Liverpool have not been good enough this season. After 11 league games, they have already suffered five defeats -- more than they did in the entire last term -- and have now lost every game in which they have conceded the first goal. Defeat to City leaves Liverpool four points behind Guardiola's side and eight behind leaders Arsenal. If the Reds cannot find a way to recover the mentality that helped them romp to the title last season, they might quickly find that their two biggest rivals are completely out of sight. -- Beth Lindop What a performance from the Man City winger. He caused chaos down City's left all afternoon and capped off a wonderful display with a fantastic goal. Conor Bradley looked comfortable against Vinícius Júnior on Tuesday, but he couldn't handle Doku. The Belgium international won the early penalty that was missed by Haaland, and every time he got the ball, there was a feeling inside the stadium that something was about to happen. At one point in the first half, he was having so much success against Bradley that Slot ordered Ryan Gravenberch to double up. Nothing Liverpool tried seemed to work, and it was only when Doku was substituted at 73 minutes that the torment stopped. His goal, cutting in from the left and curling a right-footed shot into the far corner, was so good that when it was replayed on the big screens there were oohs and aahs from the City fans. Doku has shown flashes of his ability since arriving from Stade Rennais in 2023. This season, though, he's doing it consistently. His ability in one-on-one situations is so good that when he's playing like this, he's almost unstoppable. -- Dawson As Liverpool closed in on their mightily impressive victory over Real Madrid on Tuesday, Bradley's name boomed around the stadium. The home supporters inside Anfield were keen to serenade the right back after he had delivered arguably the most impressive display of his career, defending superbly to keep the tricky Vinícius at bay. Unfortunately for Liverpool, Bradley could not match that level of performance against City and was part of a defense that struggled to contain the outstanding Doku, particularly in the first half. Alongside him, Ibrahima Konaté also endured a tough afternoon and was outjumped by Haaland for the hosts' opener, while Robertson was replaced by Milos Kerkez early in the second half. After keeping back-to-back clean sheets against Villa and Madrid, this was a reminder that Liverpool still have work to do defensively if they hope to salvage anything from this season. The return of goalkeeper Alisson Becker after the international break should help breed confidence among the back line, but the Reds' leaky defense looks like it could very well be their undoing this term. -- Lindop Missing an early penalty in a big game might have had a negative impact on a lot of strikers. Not Haaland. He saw his ninth-minute spot kick saved by Mamardashvili, but it didn't stop the Norway international from making his mark. Matheus Nunes was clever in delaying his cross from the right just enough so that Robertson turned his back. The ball into the box was quality. After that, though, it was all about Haaland. He peeled off toward the back post and rose above Konaté to head the ball back across the goal and into the corner. In many ways, it was a typical Haaland goal. He wasn't the star against Liverpool, but he still got his 19th goal of the season and his 14th in 11 Premier League games. The 25-year-old has also moved to 99 Premier League goals in just 108 appearances. Those are scarcely believable numbers. Alan Shearer, the top goal scorer in Premier League history, needed 124 games to reach 100 goals. With Haaland in form like this, it's highly unlikely he'll need another 16 games to reach the 100 club. Another record is about to go. -- Dawson If it was against City at the Etihad last season that Mohamed Salah enjoyed one of his finest outings in a Liverpool shirt, then it was on the same turf this term that the forward's recent decline was laid bare. In February, the Egypt international scored Liverpool's opener and assisted Dominik Szoboszlai for their second en route to a victory that saw them make a giant stride toward the title. On Sunday, however, Salah toiled up against the prodigious Nico O'Reilly as Liverpool slumped to yet another miserable defeat. To the 33-year-old's credit, he battled until the end, even after spurning a great opportunity late in the second half. But, despite having scored in both of Liverpool's past two league games (against Brentford and Aston Villa), he looked like a shadow of his former self against City, failing to hit the target with any of his three shots. Salah has shown enough in recent outings to suggest Father Time has not caught up with him just yet, but his latest showing proves his days as Liverpool's main man might just be behind him. -- Lindop",2025-11-09 20:07:46,Espn United Kingdom,positive,0.8228,18,Have_Moyes_For," Manchester City beat Liverpool 3-0 at the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League on Sunday .

Education crisis persists because FG neglects sector — ASUU,"Piwuna, who spoke during The Toyin Falola Interviews on Sunday, in a virtual conversation titled “A Conversation with the ASUU President,” said the indifference of key government officials towards the education sector has made it difficult to achieve sustainable reforms. According to him, members of the Federal Executive Council often view education challenges as the sole responsibility of the Minister of Education. ASUU has long relied on strikes to press for its demands. In recent years, the union has often justified industrial action as prompted by government proposals that it views as a “total departure” from the agreed terms of the 2009 FGN–ASUU Agreement, as well as unresolved issues such as outstanding promotion arrears, withheld deductions, and inadequate funding and renovation of public universities. “Members of the government, the ministers, and chief executives do not see the problem of education as a problem that affects them. “When ASUU declares a strike, the Minister of Finance sees it as the Minister of Education’s problem; the Minister of Science and Technology sees it the same way. “But if the Minister of Finance understood that the country’s economic growth depends on a knowledgeable workforce, he would take the Minister of Education’s problem as his own. The same applies to other ministries,” Piwuna said. He added that the Federal Government’s response to education issues was further hindered by ideological differences and corruption. “We in ASUU see education as a public good, but those in government treat it as a capitalist venture, something only important if it generates profit. “Many of them now suggest that TETFund should begin funding private universities. Even the last Chief of Staff to the President, who never did that while in government, is now a Pro-Chancellor advocating it. Self-interest and contract inflation have replaced public service. That is why TETFund has become a marketplace,” he said. The host, a historian and scholar, Prof. Toyin Falola, gave an overview of ASUU’s historical struggles with the Federal Government and the recurring industrial actions that have crippled academic calendars for decades. Speaking on the ongoing ASUU National Executive Council meeting in Taraba State, Piwuna said discussions on the union’s negotiations with the Federal Government were nearing conclusion. “The terms of the agreement are shaping up, and in the next week or two, we’ll make a definite statement. “But what the government is offering us as salaries is unacceptable, and we are ready to go to any length to fight it. Our salaries are nothing to write home about. “All the billionaires have private universities; none of them support public universities. We have reached out to them — even under the last administration — but nothing came of it,” he said. Piwuna added that Nigeria’s current academic conditions are pushing lecturers to survival mode, leaving little room for innovation or endowments. “Some of our colleagues sleep in their offices with their families because of poor living conditions. “How can such people be expected to source endowments or drive world-class research?

"Knight Foundation, USC Marshall commit $4 million to advance purpose-driven AI research","​​​Knight Foundation and USC Marshall Commit $4 Million to Advance Purpose-Driven AI Research ​​​Knight Foundation and USC Marshall Commit $4 Million to Advance Purpose-Driven AI Research The research initiative aims to create ethical, human-forward outcomes for cutting-edge technology like AI. The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the USC Marshall School of Business have launched a $4 million research initiative aimed at steering artificial intelligence (AI) and social media technologies toward more ethical, human-centered outcomes. Funded with $2 million from Knight Foundation and matched by USC Marshall, the five-year project will be housed at USC Marshall’s Neely Center for Ethical Leadership and Decision Making. The center will spearhead research, policy engagement, and educational efforts designed to align emerging technologies with broader social purpose. “This partnership represents a paradigm shift toward purpose-driven AI,” said Nathanael Fast, director of the Neely Center. “We need innovation, but we also need to find ways to ensure that innovation is aligned with human well-being and meaningful societal impact.” The initiative is organized around four primary research and engagement buckets: Social Media and AI Indices: Building on existing indices that track how U.S. adults engage with social media and artificial intelligence, the center will expand its surveys and partner with other organizations to scale insights. Design Codes: Researchers will develop design frameworks for AI tools — especially chatbots and digital companions — establishing principles for how these technologies should interact with people. These codes will ultimately be used to inform policy as well as guide design choices by technology companies. Youth Panel: Recognizing the importance of younger voices in shaping the digital future, the project will convene a panel of teens aged 13 to 17. This group will help guide research on policy and design standards for AI tools such as AI chatbots, where adolescent use is growing rapidly. The aim is to document both the benefits and harms of these technologies to users. Leadership Fellows: The center will expand its fellows program to cultivate the next generation of AI leadership committed to human flourishing. USC students will work alongside fellows on research and action projects that advance purpose-driven AI development. We need innovation, but we also need to find ways to ensure that innovation is aligned with human well-being and meaningful societal impact. — Nathanael Fast Director, Neely Center for Ethical Leadership and Decision Making The project will combine academic rigor with real-world application. The Neely Center plans to conduct longitudinal studies of both U.S. adults and youth, documenting how generative AI and social media shape users’ lives. Findings will be shared widely through academic publications, popular media articles, professional conferences, and targeted webinars. By creating collaborative design codes and ethical frameworks, the initiative aims to influence not only industry practice but also educate lawmakers. Policy recommendations will be developed for state and federal officials in the U.S. and shared with policymakers abroad. “Technology is advancing faster than our current ability to regulate it,” said Ravi Iyer, managing director of the Neely Center. “By providing clear, evidence-based guidelines, we can help both companies and governments ensure these tools are built and deployed responsibly.” Knight Foundation’s support will also strengthen the Neely Center’s Fellows Program, which trains MBA students in responsible technology leadership and will expand to include students across USC. Smaller grants will be available for faculty-led projects on purpose-driven AI, encouraging cross-campus research collaborations. Industry partnerships form another key component. Executives and technology leaders will have opportunities to contribute expertise, collaborate with students and faculty, and help translate academic findings into actionable corporate strategies. The project’s comprehensive approach — combining research, education, policy engagement, and leadership development — positions USC Marshall as a pioneer in shaping the future of ethical technology. Its outcomes are expected to influence conversations across Silicon Valley, Washington, D.C., and beyond. “Our faculty and students are committed to shaping AI that aligns with human values,” said Geoffrey Garrett, dean of USC Marshall School of Business. “This support will help us lead in setting the standards for purpose-driven, ethical innovation.” As AI tools and social media platforms become increasingly woven into daily life, the $4 million research initiative underscores the urgency of designing with intention. By centering human values and long-term societal benefits, the Neely Center and its partners aim to ensure that the next wave of digital innovation serves a greater purpose. For Knight Foundation, the partnership reflects its continued commitment to advancing informed public dialogue through investment in independent research on new technologies. “Online platforms and AI tools are rapidly changing how we share information, form beliefs and connect with one another. Knight is proud to support USC’s field-leading research that sheds light on how those products are built, governed and used,” said A.J. D’Amico, director of information & society at Knight Foundation. About Knight Foundation We are social investors who support a more effective democracy by funding free expression and journalism, arts and culture in community, research in areas like artificial intelligence, and the success of American cities and towns where the Knight brothers once published newspapers.

"""Zero generation"": the aftermath of Russia's record ballistic missile strike on Ukraine's energy sector","On the night of 7-8 November, Russia launched one of its most brutal attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure to date. Never before had Ukraine faced such a large number of ballistic missiles in a single attack. The Russians targeted state-owned and private power plants, high-voltage substations belonging to Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-owned electricity transmission operator, and oil and gas industry facilities. The most devastating losses were suffered by Centrenergo, a major state-owned energy company, which lost all its generating capacity. Both of its thermal power plants – Trypillia in Kyiv Oblast and Zmiivska in Kharkiv Oblast – have been completely shut down. ""It's been less than a month since the previous strike, and last night the enemy hit all our generating capacity. The plants are on fire. We have stopped. Energy generation is now at zero,"" Centrenergo said. Strikes on substations near nuclear power plants are particularly alarming. The latest attack damaged facilities near the Khmelnytskyi and Rivne nuclear power plants. The following morning, the consequences of the large-scale attack were being felt across the country: electricity shortages, emergency power cuts and prolonged blackouts in cities and villages. Despite the tireless efforts of power engineers, the situation remains critical. According to the official figures, on the night of 7-8 November the Russians launched over 450 drones and 45 missiles of various types against Ukraine. The main targets of the attack were Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv and Poltava oblasts, although other regions were also affected. A distinctive feature of this latest attack was the large-scale use of ballistic and air-launched ballistic missiles. ""Twenty-five Iskander-M or KN-23 missiles and seven Kinzhal missiles were launched. So 32 of the 45 missiles followed a ballistic trajectory,"" said Yurii Ihnat, spokesperson for Ukrainian Air Force Command. Ukraine's air defence forces shot down over 400 Shahed-type kamikaze drones, but most of the missiles reached their targets. ""Last night [7-8 November] was one of the most difficult since the start of the full-scale war,"" Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk said. ""The enemy carried out a large-scale strike with ballistic missiles, which are extremely difficult to intercept."" The extent of the damage is such that the electricity supply situation is still particularly difficult in Kharkiv, Poltava and Sumy oblasts. This wasn't the first time Russian missiles had targeted substations powering Ukrainian nuclear plants. This time, it was the Khmelnytskyi and Rivne nuclear power plants that were affected – information that was officially confirmed on the evening of 8 November by Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. ""These were not accidental but well-planned strikes. Russia is deliberately endangering nuclear safety in Europe,"" he stated. Read more: Record blackout at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant: is there a risk of nuclear disaster? Following the attack, Ukraine appealed to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), demanding an urgent meeting of its Board of Governors, and urged China, India and other countries to pressure the Russian Federation to stop attacking nuclear infrastructure. Government sources told Ekonomichna Pravda that the strikes on substations have made it difficult to distribute electricity from the Khmelnytskyi and Rivne nuclear power plants, forcing their reactors to partially reduce output. But hardest hit by the night of 7-8 November was Centrenergo. The company lost all of its power generation capacity. Russian missiles destroyed both of its thermal power plants – Zmiivska in Kharkiv Oblast and Trypillia in Kyiv Oblast. In an emotional statement, Centrenergo said: ""An unprecedented number of missiles and an innumerable number of drones targeted the very same thermal power plants that had been rebuilt after the devastating attack in 2024. The plants are on fire. We have stopped. Energy generation is now at zero. Zero!"" Before the full-scale war, Centrenergo owned three thermal power plants. The third, the Vuhlehirsk plant, has been under Russian occupation since 2022. Following the latest attack, the company has effectively lost its ability to generate electricity. ""We've lost everything that we'd been repairing around the clock. Completely,"" Centrenergo said on Facebook. According to Ekonomichna Pravda sources in political circles, Centrenergo's rather emotional (but essentially accurate) ""All is lost""-style post caused quite a stir in the President's Office, leading to a rather undiplomatic exchange between the company's management and the president's representatives. ""They called from the [President's] Office and started asking brusquely why we were spreading panic among the public and handing such 'gifts' to the Russians – sort of like 'Well done them [the Russians] – they've destroyed everything, now all the power stations are down,'"" our source said. After that phone call, the post was rewritten. The new version felt more like the Energy Ministry's usual communication style: ""Repair work is underway following the overnight attack. Repair crews are doing everything possible and necessary to deal with the aftermath of the attack as quickly as possible. We'll do all we can to restore what was destroyed as soon as possible!"" In addition to the facilities mentioned above, Ekonomichna Pravda reported that the Prydniprovska Thermal Power Plant – which belongs to DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, owned by Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov – also came under fire that night and sustained serious damage. As usual, the Russians also attacked Ukrenergo and Oblenergo facilities, which are responsible for transmitting and distributing electricity. Hydropower facilities were hit as well. There were reports of missile and drone strikes on the Kremenchuk Hydroelectric Power Plant in Svitlovodsk, Kirovohrad Oblast. The Kremenchuk hromada itself felt the consequences of the attack. [A hromada is an administrative unit designating a village, several villages, or a town, and their adjacent territories – ed.] Volodymyr Kohut, Head of Poltava Oblast Military Administration, reported: ""There is no electricity or water supply in the Kremenchuk hromada, and in some places no heating. Water deliveries will be organised shortly. Electric-powered public transport is not operating in the city, so additional buses have been put on routes. Invincibility centres are being deployed."" [An invincibility centre is a heated premises stocked with food and power banks to assist residents facing hardships due to power cuts – ed.] Government sources told Ekonomichna Pravda that Russia also targeted facilities in Ukraine's oil and gas sectors on 8 November. Damage was recorded at Ukrgazvydobuvannia, Ukrnafta and Smart Energy. A worker was killed at one company in Kharkiv Oblast. ""They [the Russians] struck oil and gas facilities using ballistic missiles and drones. The damage is significant,"" a government official said, without giving further details. For Naftogaz, Ukraine's national oil and gas company, it was the ninth targeted strike on gas infrastructure since early October. CEO Serhii Koretskyi said engineers were gradually stabilising the system, but it would take time. So Ukrainians need to prepare for more power cuts. A representative of one state-owned company said: ""The freezing cold weather hasn't even started yet and we're already short of generation capacity. It's only going to get harder. If we can get through the winter with only two queues of scheduled blackouts, it'll be a huge success."" [Ukrenergo defines a ""queue"" as a group of consumers and businesses using a specific amount of megawatts. The Dispatch Centre sets the number of queues needed across oblasts to address energy deficits. Critical infrastructure and industrial companies that import over 80% of their energy cannot be disconnected, according to a Ukrainian Cabinet resolution – ed.] One government official estimates that the latest attack has cost Ukraine's energy system at least one gigawatt of generation capacity. ""Some power is already back, and more will be restored soon, but I'm afraid part of the capacity can't be recovered quickly,"" the source added. The Ministry of Energy has confirmed that there is no question of cancelling rolling blackout schedules in the near future. Energy workers are operating in emergency mode, but repairing damaged infrastructure takes time. ""Even for minor repairs, the equipment has to be switched off, otherwise the system won't restart stably,"" Hrynychuk explained. Read more: Blackout wrapped up in an envelope: how Energy Ministry games left Chernihiv and Kryvyi Rih without extra power Energy company sources have confirmed to Ekonomichna Pravda that power outages are expected to persist for some time. ""Substations that connect nuclear power plants to the grid have been damaged. The Trypillia and Zmiivska thermal power plants have been destroyed. The deficit will persist – generation capacity can't be restored that quickly,"" one of them said. ""No one can give a precise forecast as to power cuts – everything depends on the intensity and scale of future attacks,"" another energy company representative explained. ""But we can assume that the situation will look like this. After large-scale attacks like the recent one, recovery may take several weeks, during which the country will have 3-4 queues of scheduled outages. Later it could stabilise to two queues, and eventually to one. That's the best-case scenario. But again, it all depends on the attacks."" None of this applies, however, to border and frontline oblasts, where the situation will remain difficult throughout the winter. There, the attacks and blackouts could be constant.

UK households with washing machine in kitchen risk £59 charge,"UK households have been warned over how much it costs to use a washing machine for an hour. In The Wash looked at 20 of the most popular washing machines in the UK to calculate the average amount of electricity and water used per cycle. The average washing machine cycle uses 0.46 kWh of electricity per cycle, with the average electricy costing 26.35 pence per kWh for the Energy Price Cap (EPC) period from 1 October to 31 December 2025. This means that the average washing machine costs 12.1 pence per cycle. It means if you use your washing machine 220 times a year, it would cost you £26.67 in electricity costs. READ MORE 1.6 million drivers handed £160 fine 'after wanting to follow rules' The average model uses 47.65 litres of water per cycle, at a cost of water per litre of around 0.3 pence per litre. This means that the average washing machine uses 14.3 pence water per cycle. If you use your washing machine 220 times a year, it would cost you £31.45 in water costs. Adding together electricity and water costs, the average washing machine therefore costs 26.4 pence per cycle to run - or £59 a year. The Energy Saivng Trust advises: ""Wash clothes on the shortest cycle (e.g. ""quick wash"") that's practical for your needs. ""This means less water, heated to a lower temperature and a shorter spin cycle to save water and energy. Bonus: a quick cycle will cause less damage to your clothes over time so help them last longer. ""Use a cold water or 30°C cycle where possible. You’re only likely to need warmer temperatures for particularly dirty clothes, bad stains or underwear. A cold wash will not only save energy but help the planet too. ""Soak heavily soiled items before washing, and rub shirt collars or other stains with household soap. This avoids the frustration of having to repeat a wash because stains didn't come out. ""Wait until you have a full load before washing. Naturally, if you're running out of socks you might have to put a load on (in which case, remember to use the ‘quick wash’ mode). ""But otherwise it's best to wait for a full laundry basket to avoid wasting water and electricity. Similarly, bath sheets are typically heavyweight cotton and excessively large, so you could consider standard lightweight bath towels to save on energy. ""Use a high spin speed so your clothes come out of the washing machine almost dry, with little need for tumble drying. And, of course, when it comes to drying, hang your clothes up if you can rather than using a tumble dryer.""",2025-11-10 08:05:00,Birmingham Live,negative,0.4924,-1,Outlier," In The Wash looked at 20 of the most popular washing machines in the UK to calculate the average amount of electricity and water used per cycle .

"‘Dead Man’s Wire,’ ‘Frankenstein,’ ‘Hamnet,’ ‘A Private Life’ to Play at Marrakech Film Festival","By Leo Barraclough International Features Editor The Marrakech Intl. Film Festival has revealed the lineup for its 22nd edition, which runs Nov. 28 to Dec. 6. A total of 82 films from 31 countries have been selected for the festival. Nine of these films unspool as world or international premieres, nine have received the support of the Atlas Workshops, the festival’s industry and talent development platform, and 14 represent their countries in the race for the Academy Awards. Related Stories 'Trailer Park Boys' Star Mike Smith Charged With Sexual Assault (Report) Why Jim Gaffigan Calls This ‘the Best Time That Standup Comedy Has Ever Had’ Despite Censorship and Cancellation The Official Competition showcases new talent in world cinema with 14 first and second feature films that compete for the Étoile d’Or, awarded by a jury headed by filmmaker Bong Joon-ho. Popular on Variety Moroccan filmmaker Meryem Benm’Barek, whose “Sofia” won the screenplay prize in 2018 in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard section, delivers the world premiere of “Behind the Palm Trees,” a tense psychological thriller that examines the class relations and social domination inherited from the colonial past. Australian photographer James J. Robinson presents the international premiere of “First Light,” a moral drama in which a Filipino nun questions her faith in the face of corruption. He won best Australian director at Melbourne Film Festival when the film had its world premiere. Several filmmakers revisit decisive political moments in their countries through semi-autobiographical narrative: Shih-Han Tsao’s “Before the Bright Day” evokes the anxiety of a generation faced with the threat of war in Taiwan in 1996; Akinola Davies Jr.’s “My Father’s Shadow” follows a father and his sons in Nigeria during the 1993 electoral crisis; and Zamo Mkhwanazi’s “Laundry” recounts the dreams of a young South African man during Apartheid. Two debut feature films — Siyou Tan’s “Amoeba” and Imran Perretta’s “Ish” — explore teenage friendship as it faces the challenge of political awakening, respectively in Singapore and suburban London. Three films portray women who demonstrate resistance and reinvent their destinies: Erige Sehiri’s “Promised Sky,” a tale of female solidarity in the face of racism in Tunisia; Ondřej Provazník’s “Broken Voices,” a chilling drama about the abuse of authority; and Morad Mostafa’s “Aisha Can’t Fly Away,” a fantasy thriller that follow a Sudanese woman’s quest for freedom in Cairo. In the deeply moving documentaries “Memory” and “My Father and Qaddafi,” directors Vladlena Sandu and Jihane K., respectively, revisit their childhoods in Chechnya and Libya, weaving powerful narratives of families at the crossroads of personal memory and collective history. Finally, “Straight Circle,” a satire about the absurdity of conflict, reveals director Oscar Hudson’s visual inventiveness, while “Forastera,” a summer tale of mourning by Lucía Aleñar Iglesias, testifies to the “vitality of new voices in contemporary cinema as it combines formal audacity with universal emotion,” the festival said. The Gala Screenings showcase, which include some of the world’s most anticipated films, opens with “Dead Man’s Wire,” Gus Van Sant’s satire on the media and capitalism. It also includes Maryam Touzani’s “Calle Málaga,” a tender portrait of a woman from the Spanish community in Tangier, starring Carmen Maura. As part of the Tributes program, Guillermo del Toro unveils his gothic and romantic vision of “Frankenstein” with Jacob Elordi, while Jodie Foster presents “A Private Life,” Rebecca Zlotowski’s crime comedy. Two world premieres bring together the biggest stars of Egyptian and Tunisian cinema: “El Sett,” Marwan Hamed’s biopic about the diva Oum Kalthoum, played by Mona Zaki; and “Sophia,” a chilling thriller directed by and starring Dhafer L’Abidine. A gala evening will celebrate “Hamnet” by Chloé Zhao, a moving tale of family love, in which the loss of a child inspires the play “Hamlet.” Filmmaker Neeraj Ghaywan comes to Marrakech with “Homebound,” a touching melodrama about the friendship and dreams of two young Indians played by rising Bollywood stars Ishaan Khatter and Vishal Jethwa. The festival closes with Annemarie Jacir’s “Palestine 36,” which brings together some of the greatest actors in the Arab world in a historical drama that recounts a decisive moment for the Palestinian people. The Horizons section presents 19 contemporary films that “paint a panorama of world cinema,” the festival said. It welcomes new work from major filmmakers Claire Denis, Valérie Donzelli, Ildikó Enyedi, Jim Jarmusch, Richard Linklater, Jafar Panahi, Park Chan-wook and Kelly Reichardt, and also highlights a new generation of auteurs: Ali Asgari (“Divine Comedy”), Simón Mesa Soto (“A Poet”), Teona Strugar Mitevska (“Mother”) and Mélisa Godet (“A Place for Her”). The Horizons selection also celebrates the vitality of Arab cinema, with several films that have made their mark at major festivals: Cherien Dabis’s “What’s Left of Us” won acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival; both Hasan Hadi’s “The President’s Cake” and Arab and Tarzan Nasser’s “Once Upon a Time in Gaza” won awards at Cannes; and Cyril Aris’s “A Sad and Beautiful World” and Kaouther Ben Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab” saw success at Venice. Two documentaries complete the selection: Raoul Peck’s “Orwell: 2+2=5” and Hélène Harder’s “Fatna, a Woman Named Rachid,” presented as a world premiere. The 11th Continent program consists of six fiction and nine documentary films. The section presents new films by critically acclaimed filmmakers, including Massoud Bakhshi, Oliver Laxe, Lucrecia Martel and Hlynur Pálmason, while celebrating daring auteurs like Kamal Aljafari, Lana Daher, Damien Hauser, Dima El-Hor, Gianluca Matarrese, Namir Abdel Messeeh, Lemohang Mosese and Tamara Stepanyan. The program also includes restored versions of three classics of Arab cinema, including “The Mirage” by Ahmed Bouanani (1980), which has been restored especially for this occasion. The Moroccan Panorama delivers seven fiction and documentary films by Moroccan filmmakers, of which two are world and international premieres: “Five Eyes” by Karim Debbagh and “Porte Bagage” by Abdelkarim El-Fassi. Moroccan cinema is further highlighted this year with a total of 15 films presented across the various sections of the festival. The Young Audiences and Families section offers a program aimed at children and youth aged 4 to 18, as well as families, with 13 screenings that “celebrate curiosity and an awakening to the art of cinema.” Rounding up this year’s films are a selection of films by and featuring Jodie Foster, Guillermo del Toro, Raouya and Hussein Fahmi, personalities to whom the festival offers Tributes this year, are presented at the Palais des Congrès, the Cinéma le Colisée, and the Musée Yves Saint-Laurent.

"No maybe, just 'hi baby.' Carly Rae Jepsen announces she is pregnant with first child","She is known for her earworm 2012 hit 'Call Me Maybe'. Photo: TNS It isn't crazy: Carly Rae Jepsen is expecting her first child with husband Cole M.G.N. The Canadian singer-songwriter announced her pregnancy in an Instagram post, sharing a few black-and-white photos of the couple and Jepsen's baby bump that hint there may be some kicking going on. ""Oh hi baby,"" Jepsen, 39, wrote in the caption along with a heart emoji. Her 40-year-old husband, whose full name is Cole Marsden Greif-Neill, is feeling so much love and excitement that he has been rendered speechless, if the multiple heart-eyes emojis are any indication. According to the couple's wedding spread in Vogue, Jepsen and the Grammy Award-winning producer tied the knot in October, and the couple had been trying to get pregnant while planning their New York wedding. The musicians first met as colleagues in 2021 and started dating in 2022 before getting getting engaged in September of last year. In 2023, Jepsen told People that their first collaboration, the song So Right from her album The Loveliest Time, was in essence the couple's ""meet-cute."" ""This is our first little baby out in the world,"" Jepsen told the outlet at the time. ""I think you'll see a lot more of our collaboration together for future projects."" Known for her earworm 2012 hit Call Me Maybe, Jepsen most recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of the release of Emotion with a sold-out show at the Troubadour, where she performed the entirety of the 2015 album. ""Emotion was like an introduction to my authentic version of what pop music was,"" Jepsen said of the LP in 2020.

Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. If you're anything like me, you're probably a bit of a data hoarder, maybe without even realizing it. My iPad Pro has around a hundred apps installed and a couple of browsers I regularly use, each with more than 10 tabs open at all times, and they're all caching data. In theory, caching is great, as it helps your favorite apps and browsers load faster. In practice, though, it's all too easy for those temporary files -- images, scripts, logins, etc. -- to pile up and slow down your iPad. It's like a backpack filled with junk. On a hike, it's handy to have snacks and water at your disposal, giving you the energy to make it up the mountain at record speed. Also: How to clear your iPhone cache (and fix slow performance for good) At some point, though, all that extra weight, especially if you've picked up rocks or specimens along the way, makes hiking a real slog. Clearing the cache regularly is like dumping out your backpack. It frees up storage and can give your iPad a noticeable boost. Let's walk through every way to purge cache on an iPad running iOS 26, and I'll explain why it matters in more detail. What you'll need: An iPad running iPadOS 26 and your Apple ID password or device passcode handy in case you're prompted for it. If Safari is your default browser on your iPad or iPad Pro, know that every webpage you visit, every image you load, and every video you watch saves temporary files locally called cache. Here's how to clear it. Clearing Safari's history and website data can resolve glitches or improve browsing speed without deleting your bookmarks or saved passwords. It simply removes cache, history, and cookies, allowing Safari to start fresh the next time you open it. While you'll be logged out of websites, your bookmarks and autofill passwords will still be available. Also: I found an iPhone and Mac browser that's faster, safer, and easier than Safari Tip: If you want more granular control (for example, to delete cookies but keep your browsing history in Safari), scroll further down in Settings > Apps > Safari to Advanced > Website Data, and then tap Remove All Website Data. This will clear website data only from Safari, such as cookies and tracking information. If you use Chrome on your iPad instead, you can clear cache just like you can in Safari. It also stores images, scripts, and site data to speed up your browsing experience. Over time, though, that cache can get bloated and buggy. You might notice that websites are not updating properly, pages are loading slowly, or you're experiencing login glitches. Also: I let ChatGPT Atlas do my Walmart shopping for me - here's how the AI browser agent did Unlike Safari, Chrome has its own built-in controls for managing cache and cookies. You don't need to dig through your iPad's Settings app because everything is done right within the Chrome app. Deleting the cache in Chrome will force the browser to load fresh data from websites the next time you visit them. It can also free up a noticeable amount of storage if you're a heavy tab hoarder (guilty). You might be logged out of some sites if you clear everything, but like Safari, your bookmarks and autofill passwords will remain. Chrome is great because it offers a Clear Cache option, but most apps don't, so you might want to consider offloading or deleting apps you don't need. Offloading removes the app from your device to free up space but keeps your documents and data. Deleting removes everything, including the app and its data. Deleting is the only way to fully wipe local cache, but both methods can clear temporary files and free up space. This trick is especially useful for social media, gaming, or streaming apps that can pile up gigabytes of cache. Netflix, for example, was taking up over 16GB on my iPad Pro before I offloaded it to free up local storage. Also: Low on iPhone storage space? Do this instead of deleting your apps Tip: You can also enable Offload Unused Apps (in Settings > App Store) to let your iPad automatically remove apps you rarely use. This helps free up space over time without you having to manually offload each app. Once you've cleared cache from your browsers and offloaded or deleted unused apps, restart your iPad. iPadOS manages a lot of ""invisible"" cache and hidden temporary files in the background, and a quick reboot can flush those out and refresh the memory, often making everything feel faster. I'm not talking about a full factory reset, just a simple restart. If your iPad's buttons aren't working, you can also go to Settings > General > Shut Down. Also: Is an iPad Pro still worth it in 2025? I tested the M5 model for weeks, and here's my advice Even a daily reboot can help keep things running smoothly and improve performance and security. The TL;DR version: Cache is a collection of temporary files that apps and websites store locally to speed up loading, browsing, and your overall experience on the iPad. For example, images or scripts from websites are saved so they don't have to download again. It's useful for performance, but too much cached data can slow your iPad down, so you should regularly clear it. Also: 3 Apple devices you probably shouldn't buy this month (and 9 that are safe for now) No. Clearing cache and browser history only removes temporary data, as well as your history and cookies -- not your bookmarks or passwords. Offloading an app also keeps your documents and settings safe, but deleting an app removes everything for a full reset. It depends. As a general rule, clear your browser history and cache about once a month (or more if you browse heavily) and reboot your iPad every day. Apps can be offloaded or removed as needed -- like if they're behaving oddly or taking up too much space. Also: The best iPad stylus of 2025: Our top picks for writing and drawing Safari and Chrome aren't the only browsers you might use on your iPad. You might also use Firefox or Edge, and each has its own cache-clearing method (linked). Many apps don't let you clear cache directly, but some do, so it's worth checking their settings or support pages for your most commonly used apps. For example, TikTok and Snapchat both let you clear cache within their apps.",2025-11-10 20:08:00,Zdnet,neutral,0.9141,87,Reviews_Moreamazon_Article," ZDNET's recommendations are based on many hours of testing, research, and comparison shopping .

HNL Lab Medicine Brings Escape Room Fun to Hospital Education,"ALLENTOWN, Pa., Nov. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- HNL Lab Medicine is transforming hospital training by turning mandatory education into an adventure. To strengthen the collaboration between laboratory and nursing teams, HNL Lab Medicine's Clinical Hospital Advisors have introduced an innovative ""escape room""–style educational game that turns essential lab‐related lessons into an interactive experience. The escape room begins with a familiar challenge: how to avoid getting a phone call from the lab about a rejected sample. From there, nurses progress through a series of puzzles based on real‐world scenarios, selecting properly filled blood culture bottles; answering type & screen questions; identifying best practices to prevent clotted or hemolyzed samples; ordering laboratory tubes correctly, and collecting laboratory tubes in the correct order of draw. Each correct answer provides a key or code to unlock the next stage, ultimately leading to a prize. The activity takes less than ten minutes per nurse, no longer than a standard training session, but delivers far more excitement and engagement. The format encourages problem‐solving, sparks conversation, and helps key lessons stick. ""Our Clinical Hospital Advisors are always looking for new ways to connect with hospital staff and make lab-related education enjoyable and memorable,"" said Lisa Anthony, Chief Hospital Officer of HNL Lab Medicine. ""By turning training into a hands-on game, we're not only making learning fun, but also strengthening the important relationship between nursing teams and the lab."" ""We designed the escape room format because it mirrors how nurses work in real life, solving problems under time pressure, thinking critically, and collaborating with each other,"" said Shelbi Taylor, Manager, Clinical Advisors with HNL Lab Medicine. ""It's a fun way to reinforce best practices while keeping education practical and engaging."" The program has already been well-received by nurses, who appreciate the chance to learn in a fresh and interactive way. HNL Lab Medicine plans to expand the initiative to additional types of training for their health system partners. About HNL Lab Medicine HNL Lab Medicine is a leading full‐service medical laboratory headquartered in Allentown, PA. With more than 50 patient service centers in Pennsylvania, a robust team of professionals, and years of experience delivering diagnostic excellence, HNL Lab Medicine is committed to delivering high-quality testing, innovative services, and collaborative support to hospitals, physicians, and patients throughout the region.

Staios credits Senators for rebounding after poor start to season,"Ottawa Senators centre Nick Cousins (21) celebrates his game winning goal with teammate centre Dylan Cozens (24) during second period NHL action against the Utah Mammoth, in Ottawa, Sunday, Nov. 9, 2025. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld OTTAWA - An Ottawa Senators team that left points on the table early in the season seems to have righted the ship, according to hockey operations head Steve Staios. The team, struggling weight of playoff expectations, stumbled out of the gate while dealing with the loss of captain Brady Tkachuk to injury. But Staios, the team’s general manager and president of hockey operations, believes the Senators are finding their stride as they approach the one-quarter mark of the season in third place in the Atlantic Division. “I was a little surprised on our start, to be quite honest,” Staios told reporters Monday. “You hope with the continuation of last year — similar group coming back, same coaching staff — that we would have been on our game early. “I think we’ve grown into it playing to our identity more now, but some early stumbles, I thought we pissed away some points early on, but feel like we’re getting closer to playing to our identity. Full credit to the group.” Staios believes the slow start wasn’t due to poor preparation, but rather the team’s eagerness to prove itself after breaking through last year with its first playoff appearance in seven years. “We have a very well-intended group, and I’ve stated that a number of times, and they’re eager to prove themselves, and they’re eager to compete,” he said. “I want to believe that expectations were one thing that is new to this group, making the playoffs last year, trying to get to that level right away. I think that might have been part of it.” Staios sees the recent stretch as a turning point, noting that strong defensive play against Washington and Boston helped spark the team. With points in five straight games (3-0-2), the Senators appear to have rediscovered the structured, checking-focused style that defines their best hockey. The Senators were dealt a significant blow when Tkachuk suffered an injury in just the third game of the season, and the team announced he would miss the next six to eight weeks. Staios credited the team for not using the injury as an excuse. “Well, I think we’ve handled it well. ... I think in the past, the group, the environment around here would have been pointed right towards that,” Staios said. “And we, I think (head coach Travis Green) has done a great job of not building in excuses.” In the first few games without Tkachuk, Staios felt the team may have been trying to do too much to make up for the absence. “I think the first couple of games, you could see our guys were again trying to play, they’re even a little bit more exuberant to try and make sure that we weren’t going to miss a step,” Staios said. “But I think that the strength is in the group and in the team, and the way that we play, the way that we’re coached, the commitment, the character of this group, that’s, you know, that’s our that’s our identity.” Among those leading by example has been centre Tim Stutzle, whose two-way play has taken another step. “He’s rounding out his game on the other side of the puck as well, that commitment to playing on the defensive side has been sort of the biggest area of growth for him,” Staios said. “And as you can see now, now he’s taking pride in being on the penalty kill.” Goaltender Linus Ullmark has faced scrutiny after a tumultuous start, but Staios expressed full confidence. “I believe in Linus, the team believes in Linus,” Staios said. Staios said Ullmark faced some tough luck early on, but he’s in excellent shape, rounding into form and remains the team’s clear long-term starter, with Leevi Merilainen continuing to develop behind him. Contract talks with forward Shane Pinto are ongoing, with Staios confirming “continued good dialogue” and another meeting scheduled this week. Eighteen months into Green’s tenure behind the bench, Staios praised the coach’s impact. “We set out to change a culture and an environment,” said Staios. “He’s held a high bar of accountability. He’s got a great ability to communicate with his players. He’s open, he’s honest, and he’s firm.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 10, 2025. Error!

Asking Eric: Self-aware friend cut me off when I pointed out they were using me for free therapy,"Dear Eric: I recently set boundaries with a friend who would vent to me about another friend of theirs, with whom I’m only barely acquainted. I asked them to stop processing this other friendship of theirs with me; it felt toxic. I told them I felt sad to spend the little time we have together talking about someone, when we could be talking with and supporting each other. My friend responded by cutting me off. They said that they felt not being able to process their other friendship with me felt oppressive. As far as I know, they don’t burden others over this toxic friendship, as they have burdened our friendship. I’ve been feeling sad and upset. I feel judged for setting a boundary. I feel relieved that I no longer need to hear about my friend’s toxic friendship. I am feeling shocked that my generally self-aware friend doesn’t realize they were using me for free therapy. I am grieving what feels like the end of a close friendship. I want to talk this over with them, but I’m respecting their boundary in the text they sent about not wanting to go back and forth on the matter. I want to maintain clarity in my friendships and not to talk about people when they’re not present. I’m having a sad time with the grief of this loss, and I need to talk about it, yet can’t work through it directly with my friend. I have safe spaces to grieve, and I will turn there. I wonder if you have any helpful insights to shed light on this situation. – Dumped On, Then Dumped Dear Dumped On, Then Dumped: Your letter paints a picture of someone (you) who is quite emotionally aware, who has resources and options for processing, and who is interested in taking responsibility for what’s on your side of the street. This is what we all should aspire to. And it’s no wonder that your friend saw you as such a great person to talk to. But it also sounds like your friend doesn’t have many of these qualities yet. Hence their response. Now, there’s a world where your friend feels that you’ve changed the rules of the friendship with your ask. Your friend may think what makes your friendship special is that they can talk about this so-called toxic other friendship with you. But friendship is a meadow that we meet in the middle of. The middle is a wide place; it’s not always 50/50. But if one person is standing on one side saying, “Come over here,” it’s not going to work. Ask yourself what your expectations and hopes are. In an ideal world, you’d be able to have a mature, self-aware conversation with your friend. Part of your grief may involve acknowledging that you also had an expectation of your friendship that didn’t meet reality. You’re not wrong for holding your boundary or wanting a healthier dynamic, but you’ll find some freedom in also releasing your friend from this expectation. Send questions to R.

‘Fire him!’ Fall guy for disaster Luka trade emerges in awkward scenes; miracle game winner stuns — NBA Wrap,"The Dallas Mavericks could fire general manager Nico Harrison as fallout from the Luka Doncic trade reaches breaking point. Doncic is flourishing in LA, with the MVP contender’s game-high 38 points leading the 8-3 Lakers in a 121-111 victory at Charlotte. Meanwhile Giannis Antetokounmpo’s 30 points powered Milwaukee past Dallas 116-114, despite a career-best showing from No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg (26 points, nine rebounds, four assists, two steals, one block). Watch NBA with ESPN on Kayo Sports | Stream an average 9 LIVE Regular Season games per week plus the best of the NBA Playoffs.| New to Kayo? Join now and get your first month for just $1. If the loss wasn’t enough, ‘fire Nico’ chants in Dallas, which have became all too common since the Doncic trade, overshadowed the star’s rookie big night. The Mavericks, still without Anthony Davis due to injury, fell to 3-8 — second-worst in the West — in a grim start to the season. And rumblings are growing louder around Harrison’s future nine months on from his shocking Doncic-Davis trade gamble that’s backfired spectacularly. Dallas fans continue to voice their frustrations as ‘fire Nico’ chants sounded around American Airlines Center, with the man himself in attendance during Tuesday’s contest (all times AEDT). Both the chants and chatter around Harrison’s fate are only intensifying with each passing loss, and crucially, increasing fan disenchantment. As veteran NBA insider Marc Stein put it, “If Harrison’s position as the team’s lead decision-maker is not yet untenable, well, you can certainly see that status from here”. “League sources tell The Stein Line that the rising and virtually ceaseless negativity that surrounds the franchise is indeed wearing on and troubling ownership,” Stein wrote. “While (Mavericks owner Patrick) Dumont seemingly prefers to give Harrison more time, contemplating whether an in-season change is the wisest course for the Mavericks to try to forge ahead post-Doncic has become unavoidable at the highest levels of the organization... “If Dumont eventually concludes that a mid-stream change is the best course — while it is by no means clear at this juncture where the Mavericks would turn in terms of a long-term successor — it’s believed that step would be taken not only for its vibe shift potential and as a means to try to win back alienated fans … “But also based on the premise that the front office executive who conceived and pushed for the widely criticized Doncic deal can no longer be the one trying to pilot the organization past it.” ESPN reporter and Dallas insider Tim MacMahon also flagged uncertainty around Harrison’s tenure. “At this point, I believe it is a matter of when, not if, Nico Harrison will be fired. And there is a very, very strong likelihood that (it) will be mid-season,” MacMahon said on the Brian Windhorst and the Hoop Collective podcast. In addition to to Davis being on the sidelines again with a calf issue, Dallas still remains without star guard Kyrie Irving while he rehabs an ACL injury. While it’s been a less than ideal start to Davis’ Mavs career after an adductor injury derailed the end of his 2024/25 campaign, MacMahon in a recent ESPN segment suggested the 10-time All-Star wouldn’t be put on the trade block. At least not on Harrison’s watch. “Nico would never ever do that. They are — in his own definition — in year two of their three to four year window,” MacMahon said. However MacMahon hinted that he thinks Dallas should explore offloading Davis to build around Flagg, who the team landed with the No. 1 overall pick with just 1.8% lottery odds. “They lucked out in getting Cooper Flagg,” MacMahon continued. “At some point, I would say pronto, the focus of the franchise has got to be around Cooper Flagg. Let me just remind you, in successfully building a Finals team around five-time All-NBA first team before entering his prime, face of the franchise, Luka Doncic, you gave up your first-round draft picks for ’27, ’28, ’29…” CADE’S HUGE TRIPLE-DOUBLE LEADS PISTONS IN OT Cade Cunningham’s triple double, Daniss Jenkins’s 3-pointer at the buzzer and Javonte Green’s overtime dunk lifted Detroit past Washington 137-135, stretching the Pistons’ win streak to seven games. In an unexpected thriller, the NBA’s second-best team barely outlasted a Wizards club that fell to an NBA-worst 1-10 with their ninth consecutive loss. “We knew how big this game was for us,” Jenkins said. “We wasn’t going to let nothing stop us from getting this W.” Cunningham made 14-of-45 shots and 16-of-18 free throws for a career-high 46 points and added 12 rebounds, 11 assists, five steals and two blocked shots as Detroit improved to 9-2. “He’s the one who is going to lead this team whatever we do,” Detroit’s Jalen Duren said of Cunningham. “And to see him fight through and be the great player he is gave us the confidence.” Jenkins came off the bench for a career-high 24 points and eight rebounds while Duren added 19 points and 14 rebounds for the Pistons. C.J. McCollum, who led Washington with 42 points, sank a floater with 14 seconds remaining to give the Wizards a 126-121 lead. But Jenkins, who hadn’t played in three games, sank a three-pointer with three seconds remaining and, after a Kyshawn George free throw for Washington, hit another three-pointer at the buzzer to equalize at 127-127 and force overtime. “I know what I’m capable of. I just had to believe in myself and trust in my work,” Jenkins said. Added Duren: “He never shies away from the moment. He’s going to be a great player in this league and that showed tonight.” In the extra session, Duncan Robinson’s three-pointer gave Detroit the lead and Green’s dunk made it 136-133 with 25 seconds remaining. George added a layup for the Wizards and Duren sank a free throw to create the final margin and McCollum missed two three-point attempts in the dying seconds. WIGGINS’ LAST-SECOND DUNK WINS IT FOR MIAMI In another overtime drama, Norman Powell scored 33 points and Andrew Wiggins added 23, including the winning dunk at the overtime buzzer to lift Miami over Cleveland 140-138, ending the Cavaliers’ four-game win streak to leave both clubs 7-4. Jaime Jaquez’s jumper with 7.1 seconds remaining lifted Miami level at 128-128 to force overtime. Powell sank two free throws with 6.5 seconds left for a 138-135 Miami edge but Donovan Mitchell, who led the Cavs with 28 points, made a three-pointer with 0.4 of a second remaining to equalize. Miami, however, won at the buzzer when Wiggins made an alley-oop dunk off a pass from Nikola Jovic. Another tension-packed contest came in Orlando, where Desmond Bane’s 3-pointer at the final buzzer gave the host Magic a 115-112 home victory over Portland. Paolo Banchero led the Magic with 28 points while Bane added 22, missing all five of his three-point shots before hitting the game winner. Victor Wembanyama delivered a dominating performance with 38 points, 12 rebounds, five blocked shots and five assists to lead the San Antonio Spurs in a 121-117 triumph at Chicago, missing the injured Josh Giddey. The Frenchman was 11-of-19 from the floor, including six-of-nine from three-point range, and 10-of-10 from the free throw line. James Harden matched a club record with his seventh triple double for the Clippers with 35 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds but the team’s losing streak reached five games. Grayson Allen scored 42 points, hitting 12-of-17 shots from the floor and 10-of-15 three-pointers to lead host Phoenix over New Orleans 121-98. Anthony Edwards scored 35 points and Julius Randle added 27 to power Minnesota’s 120-113 victory at Utah. Czech reserve guard Vit Krejci scored a career-high 28 points, hitting nine-of-13 shots from the floor — eight-of-10 from three-point range — to lead the Dyson Daniels’ Atlanta Hawks over the host Los Angeles Clippers 105-102. Daniels tallied six points, eight assists and three steals as the Hawks improved to 6-5. With it, the Aussie extended his streak to 62 consecutive games with a steal, setting a Hawks franchise record in a run that dates back to December 14, 2024. It’s also the eighth-longest streak in NBA history and is one shy of tying Gary Payton’s record for the seventh-longest streak in history. Chris Paul has the record with 108-straight games with a steal.

WATCH: Filipinos closely monitor Duterte’s ICC case — Survey,"Welcome to The Manila Times, where we bring you stories that shape our world. Today is November 11th. Our top story: Public attention on former President Rodrigo Duterte and his case at the International Criminal Court (ICC) remains intense. That’s according to the PAHAYAG 2025 Third Quarter Survey. The survey shows that nearly three in four Filipinos, or seventy-five percent, reported following news about Duterte’s case at the ICC. Duterte is facing trial for alleged crimes against humanity in connection with the anti-illegal drug campaign during his presidency. When asked about the aspects of the ICC case the respondents most remember, a majority of Filipinos—or 81 percent—cited Duterte’s declining health. This is followed by reports of family visits at The Hague at 53 percent, and the three counts of murder filed against him at fifty percent. The survey was an independent, non-commissioned nationwide purposive sampling study. It was conducted from September 27 to 30. The respondents were 1,500 registered Filipino voters randomly selected. Read more: The death toll from Typhoon “Tino” is still rising. It is now at 232, according to the NDRRMC. The NDRRMC also reported that 523 were injured during the onslaught of “Tino.” Another 112 individuals were reported missing. The NDRRMC says deaths, missing, and injured remain highest in hard-hit Cebu, followed by the Negros Island Region. The rest are scattered across the Visayas and parts of Mindanao. Super Typhoon “Uwan” affected over 2 million people. That’s according to the latest report from the NDRRMC. “Uwan” displaced hundreds of thousands and damaged infrastructure, homes, and farmland across several regions. At least six people were reported dead and 13 others injured. However, authorities say that most of the casualty reports still need to be validated. Read more: Five Luzon dams continue to release water due to rainfall from super typhoon “Uwan”. These include Angat Dam, the main source of water supply for Metro Manila. The others are Ipo, Ambuklao, Binga, and Magat Dams. Pagasa says “Uwan” brought a high volume of rainfall, especially in areas where dams are located. This prompted dam operators to open their gates to prevent overflow or the collapse of dam facilities. Pagasa says all concerned local officials have been informed about the opening of floodgates. Read more: “Uwan” weakened into a severe tropical storm outside the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR). It will follow a recurving path, turning northward today. It may re-enter PAR tomorrow evening as it makes landfall over the southwestern coast of Taiwan. Batanes and the western portion of Ilocos Norte remain under Signal Number Two. Read more: Dozens of flights were delayed because of a false fire at the Air Traffic Management Center. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) says the fire alarm was triggered before 1:30 this morning. This prompted the activation of the contingency plan and safety protocols, as well as a temporary hold on departures. Fifty-nine commercial and cargo flights waited for about 45 minutes before being cleared for departure. Seven arriving flights were also affected. CAAP will conduct an internal investigation to prevent similar occurrences. Read more: That’s all for now on The Manila Times Newscast.

I'm a beauty writer & these are the 'slow-ageing' treatments I'd recommend to my mother,"Despite the timeless value of beauty secrets passed down from mothers to daughters, modern aesthetics offers several new and powerful cosmetic treatments that I can recommend to mothers over 50 - including my own. Today's ""slow ageing"" approach focuses on ageing in a healthy, gradual way that ensures your look remains aesthetically balanced as you get older. Dr Rodrigo Martínez, a leading authority in regenerative aesthetics and longevity, explains this holistic beauty perspective in a nutshell: ""The idea isn't to 'erase' the years, but to handle each stage of life with care, treating the skin both inside and out; the goal is to maintain the essence of your face."" This sentiment is perfectly echoed by well-being expert and psychologist David de Cubas. ""Ageing doesn't mean you're deteriorating; it means you're consciously transforming with balance."" To help us all with this goal, there are an increasing number of treatments available. ""Regenerative and preventative options in the skincare realm are becoming more relevant and accessible to more people each day. Wondering where to start and what the options are? I talked to five experts about the best non-surgical treatments for women 50 and that give natural-looking results. These are the ones I'd even recommend to my own mum. Over 50 and concerned with sagging skin on your neck or double chin? Dr Flavia Bonina, an aesthetic doctor known for her natural-looking results, recommends Morpheus 8. She explains that this treatment uses intradermal radiofrequency with microneedles to stimulate collagen production, which helps tighten the skin and improve its overall quality. In areas with localised fat like the your chin, Morpheus 8 also performs a minor fat reduction (lipolysis) capable of subtly remodelling the jawline. ""The idea isn't to 'erase' the years, but to handle each stage of life with care, treating the skin both inside and out; the goal is to maintain the essence of your face"" Dr Bonina typically advises three or four sessions, spaced four to six weeks apart. While the results aren't instant, they become noticeable after about three months - the time required for the collagen induction process to fully take effect. After that, she usually suggests an annual maintenance session. According to Dr Bonina, determining the appropriate treatment for the nasolabial fold requires an initial assessment of the underlying cause. She notes that the issue is commonly attributed to facial flaccidity and/or changes in the facial fat compartments. ""When we're young, these structures are closely aligned, but with age, they begin to separate,"" she explains. ""The central part of the face starts to sag, and the furrow deepens."" The doctor advises that, depending on the severity of the condition, ""it will probably be necessary to combine treatments to achieve the most natural result."" She specifically recommends a multimodal approach, suggesting that the most suitable plan is to ""use Morpheus8 in combination with either hyaluronic acid or polylactic acid to counteract the visible signs of facial descent"". Asked about the most recommended lifting-effect treatments from the age of 50, Dr Bonina says: ""Although each case must be assessed individually, there are a lot of different options to fill, tighten and firm the skin with beautiful results.” Alongside Morpheus8, she recommends biostimulators. These are injectables containing substances that prompt fibroblasts (the cells responsible for generating collagen) to increase the body's natural production of this vital protein, which slows down significantly from the age of 25. She also advises using hyaluronic acid fillers, typically applied to address volume depletion in areas like the malar (the cheekbone area and the high part of the cheek directly beneath the eye). Dr. Morales Raya, a dermatologist and expert in acne, laser treatments and aesthetics, confirms that from the age of 50, the facial oval often begins to get saggy and lose definition. To treat this effectively, he recommends several options: Finally, collagen inducers are used to maintain deep support and stimulate tissue regeneration. These employ biocompatible products that improve firmness or have regenerating and anti-inflammatory properties. These are applied in one or two annual sessions, depending on the severity of sagginess and the overall treatment plan. As Dr Morales explains, ""From the age of 50, it's very common to observe a flattening or descent of the cheekbones."" To counteract this, he recommends a dual-approach treatment: Ultherapy PRIME (for lifting) and collagen inducers like calcium hydroxyapatite and polynucleotides (for structural support). He also suggests using structural fillers containing high-density hyaluronic acid. This would be used in cases where there has been a clear loss of volume, particularly across the cheekbones, the malar region and the jawline. ""No non-surgical treatment can completely eliminate severe skin sagginess, so expectations must always be clear"" Dr. Alan González, a cosmetic surgeon with over 25 years of experience, stresses that for patients over 50 who wish to avoid blepharoplasty - the surgical procedure to repair droopy eyelids - the first crucial step is a personalised assessment. This evaluation should determine whether the excess or loose skin is mild, moderate or severe. ""No non-surgical treatment can completely eliminate severe skin sagginess, so expectations must always be clear,"" he says. For effective preventative care, Dr. González recommends treatments selected for their safety and proven results, specifically mentioning microfocused ultrasound, such as Ultherapy PRIME, and yellow laser technology. He assures that these procedures help to improve skin quality and texture, delaying the visible signs of aging. He advises between one and three sessions, depending on the initial diagnosis and the patient's response.

Dear Abby: Disabled woman sees only trouble ahead if wife’s brother continues to live with them,"DEAR ABBY: Although my wife and I (we are both women) have stuck it out for nearly 40 years, there has been some dysfunction. Her brother was snuck in 10 years ago, and he’s very mouthy. He has always been whiny and entitled, but now he likes to yell, expecting silence in return. We live in a small house. What if I flipped out every time he disturbed my sleep? It’s half my house! I’m disabled and retired and living on Social Security benefits. My wife refuses to back me up and tell her brother he doesn’t get to disrespect me. I don’t want to spend the end of my life like this. It would be my hell. Things are not looking great.

Tesla Cybertruck division chief resigns,"The executive leading Tesla's Cybertruck business is leaving the Elon Musk-led automaker after eight years. Siddhant Awasthi, the program manager for Tesla's Cybertruck and Model 3, said on LinkedIn that it wasn't an easy decision to depart the company. He did not provide details on what he will be doing next. Awasthi said he began as an intern at Tesla and was involved in ""ramping up Model 3, working on Giga Shanghai, developing new electronics and wireless architectures and delivering the once-in-a-lifetime Cybertruck -- all before hitting 30. The icing on the cake was getting to dive back into Model 3 work toward the end."" Last month Tesla announced that it was recalling more than 63,000 Cybertrucks in the United States because the front lights are too bright, which may cause a distraction to other drivers and increase the risk of a collision. In March, U.S. safety regulators recalled virtually all Cybertrucks on the road. The NHTSA's recall, which covered more than 46,000 Cybertrucks, warned that an exterior panel that runs along the left and right side of the windshield can detach while driving, creating a dangerous road hazard for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash. Tesla reported a fourth-straight decline in quarterly profit in October, even as sales rose. The automaker reported that third-quarter earnings plunged 37% to $1.4 billion, or 39 cents a share, from $2.2 billion, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier. That marked the fourth quarter in a row that profit dropped. And even the revenue increase, a welcome relief from a sales plunge earlier in the year due to anti-Musk boycotts, came with a significant caveat: Customers rushed to take advantage of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit before it expired on Oct. 1, possibly stealing sales from the current quarter. While Tesla continues to have difficulties, last week Musk won a shareholder vote that would give him stock worth $1 trillion if he hits certain performance targets over the next decade. More than 75% of voters approved the plan as shareholders gathered in Austin, Texas, for their annual meeting. The vote was a resounding victory for Musk, showing that investors still have faith in him as Tesla struggles with plunging sales, market share and profits in no small part due to Musk himself. Car buyers fled the company this year as he has ventured into politics in the U.S. and Europe and trafficked in conspiracy theories. Tesla's stock rose 3.7% by close of trading Monday.",2025-11-11 08:04:00,Nwaonline,neutral,0.6373,28,Next_Greener_Future," Siddhant Awasthi is the program manager for Tesla's Cybertruck and Model 3 .

"Real Madrid Confimed to Have €150M Price on Chelsea, PSG-Linked Star","Vinícius Jr.’s future at Real Madrid may be up in the air, and PSG could stand to gain from the situation. After the 2025-26 season, the Brazilian will have only one year left on his contract, which expires in June 2027. That timeline puts pressure on the Spanish club to secure a new deal, or they might face the tough choice of selling him next summer instead of risking losing him for free. With Kylian Mbappé arriving last year, Real Madrid could also see an opportunity to cash in on Vinícius at peak value and use the funds to build a squad around the former PSG star. Journalist Sacha Tavolieri reports that Vinícius has a €150 million price tag set by Real Madrid. There is notable tension between Vinícius Júnior and Xabi Alonso, and a transfer remains a possibility. El Chiringuito recently reported that Real Madrid has set a minimum price of €150 million for Vinícius after contract extension talks stalled. Tensions between Vinícius and manager Xabi Alonso also appear unresolved, leading Los Blancos to expect keen interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, both reports follow news from transfer insider Graeme Bailey, who told The Chelsea Chronicle that Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly is eager to sign a “generational player” such as Vinicius, even if it conflicts with the club’s focus on younger, developing talents. Bailey also noted that Boehly is particularly attracted to the “commercial benefits” the Real Madrid star could bring to Stamford Bridge. The insider still believes the most likely outcome is Vinicius signing a new deal with Real Madrid, though he’s reportedly “not happy” and feels “unsettled” in Spain. Meanwhile, SPORT reports that Vinicius would be open to playing for Luis Enrique at PSG. It will be interesting to see how this entire saga transpires, but Mbappé could see the Neymar Jr. story repeat itself in Spain.",2025-11-11 08:04:00,Yahoo!

Hood River Valley boys soccer loses in 5A playoffs,"Julian Verduzco (13) gets ready for a pass for Hood River Valley earlier this year Zach Thummel photo Staff report Columbia Gorge News HOOD RIVER — Silverton outlasted Hood River Valley in the Nov. 5 first round of the Class 5A boys soccer state playoffs, edging the Eagles, 2-1, in a game decided 7-6 on eight rounds of penalty kicks. The teams were tied 1-1 after regulation and two 10-minute overtime periods, sending the match into penalty kicks. Each team made four PKs, then each team missed on their fifth try. It was 6-6 when Silverton goalie Henry Briggs got a stop for the Silver Foxes (8-2-6) and teammate Colt Lorentz, a freshman, converted the winner. It was a tough loss for Coach Alvaro Lara’s Eagles, who entered the match on a four-game win streak. HRV finished in third place in the final Northwest Oregon Conference standings with a 5-2-1 record (7-7-2 overall) and earned the ninth seed into the state playoffs. Hood River last played Silverton in 2017, when HRV beat the Silver Foxes in the first round of the playoffs. Silverton had missed the state playoffs last season, but the Silver Foxes have qualified for the postseason four times since the 2017 season, most recently in 2023. Silverton (8-3-6), seeded eighth in the playoffs, lost its quarterfinal playoff match, 3-0, on Nov. 8 at Summit of Bend.

Least developed nations complain about foot dragging at COP30,"BELÉM, Brazil — A group of the least developed countries at the global climate conference in Brazil on Tuesday criticized the sluggishness of the annual U.N. summits as producing meager results while the climate crisis is causing destruction everywhere and costing human lives. ""We meet, we speak, we discuss, we promise. We postpone, and then wait again,"" said diplomat Evans Njewa from Malawi in Belém, Brazil, where the 30th U.N. Climate Change Conference COP30 is currently taking place. At the first plenary session of the nearly 200 countries, he reiterated the demand of dozens of developing countries that industrialized nations must triple their government climate aid to at least $120 billion by 2030 to help them adapt to the fatal consequences of global warming. Njewa spoke on behalf of 44 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. He said life for many people there was a struggle for survival. Women had to travel long distances to fetch water, and farmers lost their crops season after season. ""Floods, droughts, and hunger have stretched our endurance, not just in Africa, but including the Caribbean and the Asia Pacific."" Needs many times higher than aid An Indian climate diplomat also recalled the legal obligation of industrialized countries under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement that rich countries must provide climate aid to developing countries. She referred to a new U.N. report which states that the needs far exceed current financial flows. The new U.N. report on this shows that developing countries will need at least $310 billion annually until 2035 – 12 times the current level of international public funding. On behalf of the Group of 77, which also includes China, Iraq demanded that climate aid from industrialized countries be significantly increased. In the outdated U.N. logic, China is still classified as a developing country and is therefore not a donor but a recipient country. A representative of Tanzania, speaking on behalf of the African states, said that the conference in Brazil must deliver solutions that ensure financing is based on voluntary payments and is predictable and easily accessible. A Danish climate diplomat, speaking for the European Union, noted that the E.U. and its member states, together with the European Investment Bank, are already the largest donors of public climate aid. In 2024 alone, €31.8 billion ($36.9 billion) was provided and a further €11 billion in private funding was mobilized to support developing countries. The E.U. stands by the target agreed last year that industrialized countries will provide at least $300 billion in climate finance annually by 2035, she said. ---------- Success!

Winter's coming. Where do Niagara's unhoused go if they're turned away from emergency shelters?,"Brenda Boulanger and her dog Sanders inside the tent she stayed in after being temporarily banned from the Riordan Street shelter in St. Catharines. After the first frigid, snowy night of the season, with temperatures dipping below freezing, a Niagara Region councillor wants measures to prevent more unhoused deaths this winter. St. Catharines regional Coun. Haley Bateman’s plan is to develop a winter weather emergency procedure to create stopgaps and fail-safes, to ensure unhoused people who cannot access shelters remain safe. Her aim is to end preventable deaths among unhoused people, like Bob Allen’s. Allen froze to death last winter after leaving a regionally-run shelter. City council will discuss whether to ask the region to convert Southridge shelter from In January 2025, Allen attempted to access shelters run by Niagara Region but was turned away, and was found hours later hypothermic. He later died in hospital. Bateman likened her proposal to putting out a missing person’s report for unhoused people at risk, particularly during winter. “We have to close those gaps,” she said. “We’re dealing with people very vulnerable to many things, things we can’t even think of … I want them treated as an emergency, as any missing person in Niagara.” Bateman wants to bring a motion to council setting up a system that enables the tracking of unhoused people who are turned away from shelters. She said Niagara agencies helping unhoused people have built rapport with them and know where to look and need to be “notified when somebody doesn’t come back.” “We have NASO, Welcoming Streets, CORE, EMS and regional shelter staff who have developed relationships with (unhoused) people in Niagara,” she said. “These groups work very well together, and we need to ensure we have given them every opportunity to succeed as they support unhoused people.” Brenda Boulanger, an unhoused Welland woman in St. Catharines, fears freezing to death after being banned from the Riordan Street shelter, now operated by Welland’s Hope Centre under contract to Niagara Region. She and her service dog Sanders spent Sunday in a tent, huddled under blankets for warmth, as temperatures fell below freezing and snow began to fly. “(It) was terrible last night, heartbreaking, I cried most of the night,” she said. According to Canada’s weather information website, the temperature felt like -7 C with wind chill. Boulanger was informed Thursday she faced a three-day shelter ban, which she said workers called a sabbatical. “They (shelter workers) were like, ‘Anywhere you can go?’ I said, ‘No, because if there was, I wouldn’t be in the shelter,’” she said. Boulanger entered homelessness in 2023 after a breakdown in her relationship of 15 years, resulting in her moving out. Unemployed, she was unable to find affordable housing and was later robbed and beaten resulting in a brain injury. She is waiting for approval of her Ontario Disability Support Program application, which was submitted in September. If accepted, she hopes it will provide enough money for housing. The shelter ban stemmed from excess baggage, Boulanger said. In Niagara shelters, people are limited to two garbage bags, including clothing, personal belongings and toiletries. The experience has been “traumatizing,” for Boulanger and if it was not for the unhoused community, she believes she would have died. “I would’ve froze to death … last night, it was windy, the snow was … coming into the tent. If I wouldn’t have had what my friend brought me, a blanket, I probably would’ve died,” she said. “My dog kept me alive all night, there’s no way that someone could live in a tent like that in these conditions, it’s unimaginable.” Boulanger said she dressed in layers to keep out the cold, but it was “impossible to stay warm,” under the conditions. “I had on like seven hoodies and three pairs of pants, and I was still freezing,” she said “My dog had on three (dog) coats and sweaters herself, plus all the blankets and it was still brutal.” As of Monday, Boulanger said the shelter ban was lifted if she adhered to bag limits. If not, she potentially faced another three-day suspension. The Hope Centre cited privacy concerns regarding The Standard’s request for comment on Boulanger’s situation. Hope Centre executive director Jon Braithwaite, in an emailed statement, he said it is difficult deciding on temporary service restrictions or discharges in the shelter system. “These decisions are never made lightly and are always guided by concern for the safety of clients, staff and the effective operation of the shelter,” he said. “The Hope Centre follows a set of shelter standards … approved by the Region, guiding any application of service restrictions and are only used after other attempts for compliance have been exhausted. “Weather conditions and overall safety are always considered, and we work with community partners to ensure people have access to appropriate alternatives whenever possible. In many cases, guests can return after a temporary restriction.” The Hope Centre understands how difficult it can be, Braithwaite said, but the centre’s goal remains “to help people find safe, stable and permanent housing, while maintaining a supportive environment for everyone who relies on our services.” Bateman hopes to have her motion considered next week at the next meeting of regional council.

Deer hunting season opens up locally,"A deer is seen here in front of a colorful tree line in 2020. (File photo by Ricardo Reitmeyer) Last weekend, Minnesota’s hundreds of thousands of deer hunters made their way into fields and forests across the state, providing great opportunities for camaraderie with their buddies and a chance to put some tasty venison in their freezer ahead of winter. Across the state, more than 200,000 hunting licenses were sold ahead of the Nov. 8 deer hunting opener, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Last year, the DNR reported that 440,000 hunters harvested 170,000 deer across the state. Deer hunting season officially began on Sept. 13 with bow hunting, which will last until the end of the year. Youth and early antler-less hunting lasted from Oct. 16-19, while firearm season kicked off on Nov. 8 and will only run until Nov. 16 locally. Despite the firearm season’s brief length (though it’s a week longer in northeastern Minnesota), the DNR estimates that deer season generates hundreds of millions in total economic activity as hunters fan out to rural areas across the state. Deer hunting season is a boon for the DNR, which relies on hunters as its primary means of managing deer populations. The state is divided into a patchwork of Deer Permit Areas, with Waseca County primarily split between areas 230 and 232. Area 232, which includes the Findley, Moonan and Waseca Wildlife Management Areas, offers a three-deer limit for the fourth consecutive year as a means of attempting to stabilize deer populations in the area and provide opportunities for hunters. By contrast, Area 230 which includes the Born, Linde and Quade Wildlife Management Areas offers just a two deer limit. According to DNR statistics, the two Areas had a similar success rate in 2024 with about 35% of hunters bagging a deer. The presence of Chronic Wasting Disease can make a deer hunt more complicated, though the good news is that local herds aren’t yet believed to be infected. Still, optional CWD testing is available for hunters who may want to be cautious and responsible. Up in the Rice County area, a CWD Management Zone has been in effect since 2020 after CWD was found in a deer. That means mandatory carcass restrictions are in place for all deer and CWD testing was mandatory on the opening weekend. Some additional areas have been designated as “CWD surveillance zones,” as CWD has not yet been found in wild deer but they are considered at risk for transmission due to the presence of CWD in a neighboring area or in farmed deer. Precautionary measures are taken in these areas, for example the deer feeding and attractant bans currently in place in Le Sueur, Rice and Steele Counties, which are attempts to prevent concentrations of wild deer in areas considered to have an elevated risk of disease. Locally and across the state, deer numbers are believed to be plentiful this year due to a relatively mild winter and a solid crop, said Owatonna Area supervisor Jeanine Vorland, whose office oversees Waseca County and five other local counties. While last year’s deer harvest remains well below historical peaks, Vorland said that the sport has made a significant comeback locally and that recent years have represented something of a heyday for hunters who realize they don’t need to go “up north” to bag a deer. “Some of us say these are the good old days for deer hunting in southern Minnesota,” Vorland said. “For many decades, deer were extremely uncommon in this part of the state, but in the last 20 years deer populations have become much more sustainable.” For those who may be enjoying deer hunting for the first time, Vorland said that conditions look great but emphasized the importance of safety. That includes wearing blaze orange clothing to avoid accidents and taking care while going up to and down from your deer stand to avoid a fall. “We’re expecting that people should have a good chance of seeing a deer and bagging a deer,” Vorland said. “Get out and enjoy nature and have a safe hunt.” Get any of our free email newsletters — news headlines, e-edition, prep sports, obituaries, entertainment and more.

‘Running Man’ review: Dystopian action reboot starring Glen Powell limps along,"Running time: 133 minutes. Rated R (strong violence, some gore, language). In theaters Friday. Playing an all-powerful TV producer in the dystopian action film “The Running Man,” Josh Brolin dramatically proclaims, “Critics say ‘The Running Man’ represents a return to the barbarism of the Roman Colosseum!” I wouldn’t go that far. Gladiators battling lions is way cooler than anything in run-of-the-mill “Running Man.” But I would say that the reboot of the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, starring Glen Powell, marks an unnecessary return to 1987 and a regurgitation of the past 13 years of “Hunger Games” films. Not to mention “Battle Royale” and “Squid Game.” It’s death by reality TV. Again. What makes this new film, based on Stephen King’s 1982 novel set in a futuristic authoritarian America, theoretically enticing is its writer and director: Edgar Wright. The sharp Brit has tickled and terrified before, with “Shaun of the Dead,” “Hot Fuzz” and the sexy horror time-travel movie “Last Night in Soho.” Yet Wright’s signature identity here becomes as anonymous as its disguised main character, Ben Richards (Powell), the hunky guy who’s trying to avoid being killed for 30 days in order to win $1 billion. Where is Wright’s mastery of tone and zany-but-unnerving quick-cut style? It’s been replaced by a cacophony of assembly-line sci-fi noise in a blah “Blade Runner” that, depending on the scene, is either stupidly serious or seriously stupid. Our hero is a meathead who’s all determination, no personality. Working-class Ben’s little daughter is sick. She has a fever, and the family has no money. So, Ben heads to the monolithic Network and signs up to be a reality TV contestant to rake in some dough. He winds up on the most dangerous and popular show of all — “The Running Man,” where he’s chased around the country by gun-toting “hunters” for a month in a race to survive. No one ever wins. Least of all the audience. William H. Macy gives Ben a fake ID and he trains to New York. Competing with two other “runners” (Katy O’Brian and Martin Herlihy, who there is nothing to say about), he dons a mustache and, later, pretends to be an Irish priest — accent and all. That Ben could deceive even a single person is absolutely impossible. The Ryan Seacrest of “The Running Man” is Bobby T. (Colman Domingo), a flashy host who makes grandiose statements with the kerplunk of an anvil, such as “Bloodlust is our birthright!” Domingo, who is suddenly in every movie, gives his usual sinister-with-a-smile performance that’s fast becoming shtick. A lot of the comedy, such as it is, falls to Bobby T., and it’s all lame, which is not entirely the actor’s fault. The jokes are just as bad everywhere else. A recurring bit with a “Keeping Up With the Kardashians”-like show called “The Americanos” is spray-tan fake and an unfunny clunker. Even as a vanilla sprinter, Powell radiates movie-star energy. Although he was better in “Twisters” and “Top Gun: Maverick,” he’s highly watchable here. Though Wright might have gone a tad further to make the actor believably low-caste. At one point, poor Ben shouts at a woman played, by Emilia Jones, saying that her scarf costs more than his ailing daughter’s meds. This is conspicuous, however, as Powell’s perfect, blinding teeth look like they were ripped off a Steinway grand piano. Jones’ shrieking and extreme overacting, by the way, should get some notice from the Razzie committee. We arrive at the final violent confrontation via the assistance of Michael Cera, who plays an ex-Navy SEAL. Just kidding! He’s a nerd. Aboard a jet, Brolin’s Dan Killian, who’s the sort of villain who stares out the window as he whispers to you, forces in some requisite twists that the viewer is way ahead of. The “duh” ending is a poorly handled let-down you have seen in a thousand other movies. “If only,” you leave thinking, “we had returned to the barbarism of the Roman Colosseum.”",2025-11-11 20:07:59,New York Post,neutral,0.5918,30,Ayo_Who_Del," ""The Running Man"" is an unnecessary return to 1987 and a regurgitation of the past 13 years of “Hunger Games” films .

Australia Faces Cyber Threats: A New Era of Espionage!,"Australia's telecommunications and critical infrastructure sectors face growing threats from Chinese hacking groups, according to Mike Burgess, director general of Australia's Security Intelligence Organisation. Speaking on Wednesday, Burgess cautioned that these activities could lead to significant economic disruption if sabotage were to occur. Last year, espionage cost Australia a staggering A$12.5 billion, with A$2 billion lost in trade secrets and intellectual property. Burgess specifically mentioned the Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon groups, describing them as operatives working for Chinese government intelligence and military. Despite China's routine denials of hacking, Burgess points to evidence of Chinese hackers probing Australia's telecommunications networks and critical infrastructure. He warned of potential disruptions to vital services, including banks, transportation, water, and power, and emphasized that the threat is real, not hypothetical.

"Your AI questions, answered by USC’s librarians","Illustration created by Curtis Fletcher on Midjourney, an AI image-generation tool Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming how knowledge is created, accessed, and preserved. As the University of Southern California takes up these questions this week at its first USC AI Summit, the USC Libraries stand at the center of the conversation. Business librarian Benjamin Hall will take part in the summit, presenting on “Information Literacy in the Age of AI,” one example of how USC librarians are helping the university community navigate this rapidly evolving landscape. For centuries, libraries have helped scholars navigate each new information revolution, from cataloguing the printed book to mastering the digital database. Librarians and library personnel aren’t just observers of this latest transformation; they’re essential partners, helping students and other researchers think critically about the technologies revolutionizing life and learning today. We asked several of them to share their perspectives —and how to approach these technologies thoughtfully. Kelsey Vukic (head, Social and Behavioral Sciences Library Services): Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT are trained on large language models, which makes them adept at recognizing patterns and “guessing” how text might unfold. While they might be able to answer some questions, they typically are not transparent about the data used to generate their responses. Library databases, by contrast, provide access to research materials and other publications that present evidence or findings from verified research. While you cannot ask a library database “why is the sky blue?,” you can, using appropriate search terminology, find publications that explain why the sky is blue and cite their evidence, and follow the ongoing scholarly conversation on the topic. Clarissa Moreno (social and behavioral sciences librarian): Keep in mind that while USC offers access to some AI tools such as Copilot and Gemini, the USC Libraries do not endorse any specific tool, and most are not designed for research purposes. To choose the right tool for you, first consider what you want to achieve—feedback, organization, or something else entirely. Then evaluate the tools available to you, factoring in access through USC, cost, usage limits, and features. It’s also important to see whether the tool fits your workflow or integrates with your existing software. Finally, try your top choices on a small task to see how suits your needs. Each tool interacts differently with its users, so there’s no one-size-fits-all solution—yet. Moreno: At this time, the USC Libraries do not officially endorse any AI tools. While some of the databases are beginning to offer AI or “research assistant” features, it is worth noting that AI cannot replace the critical role of the human researcher. Before using any AI tool for research help, you should be confident in your own research skills, as research is a very personal process and only you can truly understand what it is you are looking for. Vukic: APA Style recently updated its guidelines for citing generative AI. Previously, it was standard to cite the AI tool, not the individual chat session. However, since many AI tools now make it possible to share individual chat sessions, APA now allows both in-text citations and references when doing so benefits the reader. Follow the author–date–title–source format. See the APA Style Blog for sample citations. Michaela Ullmann (head, Instruction & Assessment): Many librarians at USC bring expertise in the use and ethical implementation of AI, offering workshops and instruction sessions on the critical use of AI in research as well as on discipline-specific AI tools. Beyond their individual and subject-focused initiatives, librarians and staff collaborate across the USC Libraries—through groups such as the USC Libraries AI Taskforce and the AI Information Literacy Working Group—to develop guidance for students and scholars on the responsible use of AI in research. These collaborations address topics such as the ethical and legal implications of training large language models on copyrighted materials, the review and assessment of AI research assistants in vendor products, and the creation of tutorials and lesson plans on the critical use of AI for information literacy instruction. USC librarians also contribute to university-wide and national discussions on AI literacy, helping shape how libraries prepare students and researchers for an evolving information environment. Danielle Mihram (digital scholarship librarian): Yes—thanks to its ability to analyze massive datasets, identify complex patterns, and bridge disparate fields of study at a scale and speed impossible for human researchers alone. While AI is a powerful tool for discovery, human judgment remains crucial for interpreting AI-generated insights, providing context, and guiding the meaning of the discoveries. The partnership between human researchers and AI systems creates opportunities for major scientific and creative advances that neither could achieve alone. One example is the intersection of AI and historical research, which is rapidly evolving and transforming how researchers access, analyze, and interpret history. A 2025 article in Historica notes that AI tools—from large language models to advanced data-processing pipelines—are no longer experimental; they are actively integrated into workflows, enabling historians to tackle complex questions, process vast multilingual corpora, and uncover connections that might otherwise remain hidden. The project “Mining the Dispatch” exemplifies this trend. It explores the dramatic and often traumatic changes in the social and political life of Civil War Richmond, analyzing nearly the full run of the Richmond Daily Dispatch from the eve of Lincoln’s election in November 1860 to the evacuation of the city in April 1865. Its principal methodology—a computational, probabilistic technique—uncovers categories and discovers patterns across the text corpus. For a comprehensive coverage of AI and the Digital Humanities, see my research guide on the subject. Sam Gustman (associate dean for library IT and chief technology officer): We're likely to see AI agents monitoring signs of degradation over time in important cultural collections. For example, we know that tape recordings start to rot after 20 years and show age-related damage. AI agents can assist with monitoring large-scale audio and videotape collections at libraries and archives and issue warnings based on the ages of individual tapes. For digital collections, AI agents can do something very similar. We give every digital video file in our USC Digital Repository a unique fingerprint that helps us monitor its integrity. An AI agent could monitor fingerprints across a massive, petascale digital collection to look for early signs that individual files are starting to no longer match their preservation fingerprints. Bo Doub (accessioning archivist): As an accessioning archivist, I use AI chatbots primarily as data transformation tools to enhance descriptions of archival resources. When the USC Libraries acquire archival collections, each acquisition often includes notes and inventories describing the contents to varying degrees. My job is to contextualize and structure these descriptions into published finding aids that allow researchers to discover and use the materials in their work. I use ChatGPT to transform unstructured inventories—often legacy Word documents written in narrative form by collections’ creators or their family members—into structured data in Excel. Once the data has been organized into a standardized template that separates descriptive elements such as folder titles, creation dates, physical descriptions, and extents, I import the resulting metadata into the collection's published finding aid. This AI-assisted workflow streamlines accessioning and processing by reducing manual data entry while also expediting researchers' access to newly acquired collections. Two librarians offered different perspectives. Bridgid Fennell (education librarian): Libraries can contribute to the large language model ecosystem, but preserving the full corpus of training data is not the best use of our resources. The Internet Archive already collects publicly accessible digitized media ingested by LLMs, while libraries collect or subscribe to high-quality, user-centered resources that have been appropriated outside of the copyright protection. The utility of LLMs lies in proprietary algorithms; Stanford’s Foundation Model Transparency Index illustrates AI tech giants' opaque practices and data source acquisition. Projects like the Public Interest Corpus—a collaboration between the Author’s Alliance and Northeastern University—invest in AI technologies that value intellectual and creative producers while serving the public good, ensuring that corporations don’t exploit knowledge production or monopolize innovation. Deborah Holmes-Wong (director, USC Digital Library): Everyone is thinking about LLMs when they say “AI.” AI is more than just generative AI and LLMs. There are other types of models like computer vision which is used for facial recognition, finding tumors, and ""reading"" license plates. There are models used in security systems to identify anomalies and sound alarms; by banks to approve loans; by universities to identify students; and by employers to select job candidates. These systems use probability to produce results. Biases or errors in either the model or training data can harm large groups of people by denying them loans, education, and jobs. These models, along with their training data, need to be archived so that their impact can be assessed in the future. Curtis Fletcher (director of the Ahmanson Lab at the USC Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study): Effective critical AI literacy requires building on the principles of information literacy as practiced in academic libraries. Library professionals offer a unique model of information literacy, one that is focused on the full life cycle of information in order to foreground the social, cultural, and technical systems that determine how it is collected, accessed, and granted authority. Concepts central to this work, such as data provenance, collection bias, and even epistemic power, provide crucial tools for understanding how AI systems are built, how they function, and what assumptions they carry. Amid today’s relentless AI hype and adoption, this perspective is essential to developing critical AI literacies that surface the ways in which technical infrastructures, social hierarchies, and cultural narratives shape the data that feeds contemporary AI systems, the broader knowledge environments within which they now operate, and the power dynamics and epistemic authority we increasingly grant to the corporations that develop them. Put simply, library professionals are specially trained and uniquely equipped to think and teach about socio-technical information systems—and that is precisely what current generative AI models are. Mike Jones (director of web and automation technologies): AI has incredible potential to help students and libraries foster deeper, more meaningful engagement with library collections and resources. By approaching AI as an assistive tool rather than a means of outsourcing research, students are empowered to explore the USC Libraries' collections in a more intuitive and accessible manner. For the libraries, AI opens opportunities to develop new services and tools, such as our Interactive Interviews, that lower barriers to discovery, creating unique and personalized learning experiences that align with each student's individual interests.",2025-11-12 08:05:00,University Of Southern California,neutral,0.7278,14,More_Real_Usc," AI is transforming how knowledge is created, accessed, and preserved .

Rosalie Jercich,"Birth: 1938 Death: 2025 February 12, 1938 – November 6, 2025 Rosalie Ann (Bailey) Jercich, beloved wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, sister, and friend, passed away peacefully surrounded by family on November 6, 2025. She was born on February 12, 1938, in Salinas, California, and raised in the Springfield area of Monterey County between Watsonville and Moss Landing. One of five children, Rosalie learned the value of hard work early, picking strawberries with her siblings in the fields of the Salinas Valley during the summer. She loved reading and horseback riding, and she was a good student who rode the bus daily to Watsonville High School, graduating in 1955. While there, she met her husband, Anthony Jercich, first drawn to his beautiful souped-up 1946 Ford Club Coupe and soon after to Anthony himself. They were married that same year and recently celebrated 70 years of marriage. Rosalie began her career just two days after high school as a switchboard operator for Pacific Telephone in Watsonville. She loved this job. Over the years, she held key administrative positions at Mee Memorial Hospital in King City, Ulatis Medical Group in Vacaville, and later with Sprint Communications and Solano County Health and Social Services. She was also a restaurateur for eight years in Napa. She retired in 2000. Her dedication, hard work, and professionalism left a lasting impression wherever she worked. After retirement, Rosalie and Anthony enjoyed traveling throughout the Southwest in their fifth-wheel trailer, camping in the Sierra-Nevada mountains. She also visited Europe several times. She loved gardening–each summer she planted a beautiful garden that provided summer vegetables for the family. Rosalie was a devoted, loving mother and an even more devoted grandmother. She adored her grandchildren–Carlie, Matt, Kathleen, and Michael–and later her great-granchildren Taytum Rosalie, Blake, and Kaylie Mae. They were all her pride and joy. She and Anthony took the grandkids camping many times, creating wonderful memories filled with fun and adventure. The couple also shared a deep affection for their dogs, especially Sultan and Hunter, who were cherished members of the family. For 15 years, Rosalie and Anthony lived in Folsom, helping their son Scott and daughter-in-law Patricia raise their two children. When they learned they would become great-grandparents, they returned to Vacaville to be closer to their great-grand daughter.

Prediction: This Dividend-Paying Value Stock Will Join Berkshire Hathaway in the $1 Trillion Club Before Walmart,"The $1 trillion club is growing due to record earnings and investor enthusiasm. Lately, the stock market has been marking many market capitalization milestones. Nvidia surpassed $5 trillion in market cap, and Microsoft and Apple soared above $4 trillion. At this writing, Alphabet is over $3.3 trillion, Amazon is around $2.6 trillion, and Broadcom, Meta Platforms, and Tesla are all over $1.4 trillion. But the only nontech-focused U.S. company with a market cap over $1 trillion is Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A +1.21%) (BRK.B +1.34%). Here's why JPMorgan Chase (JPM +1.29%) could become the next value stock to join the $1 trillion club, and why the dividend stock is a buy now. Image source: Getty Images. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway gets a lot of attention for its positions in public equities. But the value of its controlled businesses, led by insurance, as well as its mound of cash, cash equivalents, and Treasury bills, is far more valuable. Berkshire's strength is its ability to produce growing operating earnings from its controlled businesses, which takes the pressure off the need to buy shares in public companies. In fact, Berkshire has been reducing its stakes in top holdings like Apple and Bank of America (BAC +0.76%) and has gone five consecutive quarters without repurchasing Berkshire Hathaway stock. JPMorgan is similar to Berkshire in that it is a highly differentiated business that can pull multiple levers to grow earnings. The diversified bank generates revenues from its commercial and investment banking services, as well as net interest income (NII) from interest-earning assets. When interest rates are high, the company can generate more NII, but high rates can also slow deal-making, mergers and acquisitions, and mortgage and car loan activity. NII is the difference between interest earned on loans and interest paid on deposits. It's similar to an insurance company's float, which is the amount of premiums that haven't been paid out in claims. For decades, Warren Buffett has discussed the importance of growing Berkshire's float. The stockpile is now so large that Berkshire generates billions of income from it each quarter. NII is valuable because it is highly profitable and high margin. The other side of the business is non-interest revenue, which JPMorgan generates from fees, commissions, investment banking services, and asset management. As shown in the table, JPMorgan has steadily increased its NII and non-interest revenue (practically uninterrupted) for the last decade. Metric 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 (Guidance) Net interest income (billions) $46.08 $50.1 $55.05 $55.06 $54.56 $52.31 $66.71 $89.27 $92.58 $95 Non-interest revenue (billions) $49.59 $50.61 $53.97 $53.72 $64.98 $69.34 $61.99 $68.84 $84.97 N/A Data source: JPMorgan Chase. Over the last three years, results have accelerated in lockstep with JPMorgan's surging stock price -- which has tripled in the last five years. The financial sector has more than doubled over that period, outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.01%). JPMorgan's outsized gains are backed by quarter after quarter of blowout results. In third quarter 2025, JPMorgan earned a whopping 20% return on tangible common equity (ROTCE). ROTCE is a key profitability metric used by big banks to show how effectively they are profiting from their capital. It's similar to how investors compare operating margin as a profitability metric in other industries. JPMorgan's ROTCE tends to be higher than its peers -- Bank of America, Wells Fargo (WFC 0.10%), and Citigroup (C +2.09%). This is why JPMorgan has a more expensive valuation, based on price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) value. JPM PE Ratio data by YCharts For context, JPMorgan's 10-year median P/E is 11.9 and its 10-year median P/B is just 1.5. So the bank is relatively expensive right now, but for good reason because its growth rate has accelerated. Similar to JPMorgan, Walmart's (WMT +0.09%) stock price has skyrocketed in recent years. Both companies now have market caps over $800 billion -- pushing them closer to joining the $1 trillion club. Like JPMorgan, Walmart's stock price is responding to improving fundamentals in the underlying business. The company has done a masterful job of delivering value to its customers and producing solid results, even as many of its retail and consumer staples peers struggle. In its latest quarter, Walmart grew revenue by 4.8% year over year, but adjusted operating income was up less than 1%. Walmart is leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to improve its operations -- announcing a partnership with OpenAI that allows customers to complete purchases from Walmart directly within ChatGPT. Walmart is producing excellent results from its advertising business, as well as e-commerce and delivery through Walmart+. But still, those results aren't good enough to justify its sky-high P/E of 38.7, compared to a 10-year median P/E of 28.4. Buying stocks at all-time highs is never easy. But in today's market, it's hard to find high-quality, industry-leading companies at dirt cheap valuations. The solution isn't to sell out of an expensive market, but rather to center your portfolio around companies that can consistently grow earnings fast enough to justify their valuations. JPMorgan stands out as the most likely candidate to join Berkshire Hathaway in the $1 trillion club, simply by continuing to grow its NII over time. Meanwhile, Walmart is already expensive and doesn't have a clear path toward accelerating earnings growth at a rate that would justify its already overextended valuation. JPMorgan and Walmart pass along a considerable amount of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, but JPMorgan has a higher yield at 1.9% compared to Walmart's 0.9%. All told, JPMorgan stands out as the type of expensive stock that's worth buying and holding, whereas Walmart isn't growing earnings rapidly enough to justify its nosebleed valuation.",2025-11-12 08:05:00,Fool,positive,0.9317,-1,Outlier, Only nontech-focused U.S. company with a market cap over $1 trillion is Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A +1.21%) JPMorgan Chase (JPM) could become the next value stock to join the $1.1 trillion club .

Up 120% this year! How is this dividend share still undervalued?,"A high-yielding dividend share that’s enjoyed significant price growth is a rare thing. Even more rare is one that still looks undervalued after such a feat. So you’ll understand my surprise when I came across just that — a relatively small £509m agriculture stock that’s crushing big FTSE 100 (^FTSE) names. I had to dig deeper… Anglo-Eastern Plantations (AEP.L) has emerged as one of the most remarkable success stories on the London market this year. With dividends, it’s achieved an astonishing 120% in 2025. Such growth would’ve turned a modest £5,000 investment on New Year’s Eve into roughly £11,000 today. That’s a £6,000 profit in just 10 months — an extraordinary feat for what many investors might once have dismissed as a sleepy agricultural stock. The company, headquartered in London, operates mainly across Indonesia and Malaysia, where it cultivates and processes palm oil and rubber. Palm oil remains its core business, used in everything from food manufacturing to cosmetics and biofuels. With global demand for vegetable oils surging and El Niño weather patterns constraining supply across Southeast Asia, palm oil prices have risen sharply. This has been a key driver of Anglo-Eastern’s explosive share price growth. What makes this rally particularly impressive is that it isn’t built on pure speculation. The company’s earnings have actually kept pace with the stock’s performance. In its latest half-year results, it reported a 70.3% year-on-year increase in earnings, driven largely by surging prices but also disciplined cost management (revenue in the same period only grew 35.3%). That kind of growth helps justify the low valuation, suggesting the rally reflects real operational strength rather than just market hype. Even if the growth slows, the 5% dividend yield could deliver decent returns in the meantime. Critically, it’s paid uninterrupted dividends for two decades and increased them every year for the past five. Furthermore, cash flow covers payments an unprecedented 20-fold, so no reason to fear a near-future cut. Naturally, when a company’s profits are driven by external factors, caution is warranted. Palm oil prices are notoriously volatile, and a reversal in commodity trends could quickly squeeze margins. In the past, the stock has rapidly doubled in price, only to crash back lower in the following months. So investors considering the stock will need to accept that it might be a bumpy ride. Still, Anglo-Eastern stands as a rare example of a small-cap agricultural stock delivering both growth and value. But more importantly, its soaring share price appears well-supported by solid fundamentals. For most UK investors, Anglo-Eastern would probably be an unusual choice. It seems hard to find a place for it among the finance giants, tech start-ups and energy stocks of the FTSE 100. However, I think it’s still worth considering because it ticks a lot of boxes: a strong balance sheet, minimal debt, consistent cash generation and a history of stable and reliable dividends. Plus, its conservative management approach has capitalised on favourable market conditions without over-extending financially — a combination that many commodity producers struggle to maintain. But for those looking for something closer to home, the FTSE 100’s recent record high suggests a lot of other opportunities exist on the UK market. The post Up 120% this year!

"Code Metal Raises $36.5 Million For Verifiable, AI-Powered Code Translation","BOSTON, Nov. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Code Metal today announced it has closed $36.5 million of funding for its Series A round to advance its goal of accelerating mission-critical industries with provably correct AI code translation. The round was led by venture capital firm Accel and values the company at $250 million. The raise marks a new phase of growth for Code Metal, which has deployed its platform across the defense, automotive, and semiconductor industries, and is already on contract to deliver eight figures in revenue this year. Code Metal's platform is used in industries with strict safety and regulatory requirements for rapid feature development, code portability, and code modernization. Before Code Metal, these industries could not leverage AI for their software development tasks due to accuracy and other fundamental limitations of AI. In addition to Accel, Code Metal is proud to welcome new investors including RTX Ventures, Bosch Ventures, Smith Point Capital, Overmatch VC, and AE Ventures. The round also includes participation from distinguished individuals such as John Tenet CEO of Chaos Industries, philanthropist and serial biomedical entrepreneur Paul Schimmel, GovForce CEO Kendall Collins, telecommunications pioneer Robert Cohn, and defense investor Chris Heinz. Code Metal also secured additional commitments from existing investors Shield Capital and J2 Ventures, with continued support from Fulcrum Venture Group. ""Vibe coding helps software teams build MVPs fast. But it doesn't address our customers' needs: writing zero-error production code onto hardware,"" said Peter Morales, founder and CEO of Code Metal. ""Helping industries like auto and defense not get left behind by AI: that isn't purely an AI problem. It's where multiple disciplines meet, and that's where Code Metal operates. Revisiting the industries where I began, and demonstrating real impact in production, has been a full-circle moment. The momentum we're seeing speaks for itself."" ""In sectors like healthcare, finance, and defense, precision isn't a luxury, it's required,"" said Steve Loughlin, Partner at Accel. ""Code Metal understands that the next generation of AI infrastructure will depend on language and hardware working in sync. Their approach combines deep technical rigor with a practical understanding of how real industries operate."" ""We see Code Metal as a transformative enabler for the next generation of intelligent, connected systems. Code Metal's AI-driven approach to code translation and deployment at the edge directly supports Bosch Ventures' vision of bringing greater automation, reliability and scalability to industrial and mobility applications,"" said Adam Jackson, Partner at Bosch Ventures. ""Shield Capital's additional commitments reflect our continued enthusiasm for both Code Metal's AI-enabled code translation technology, which has immense value for defense and commercial customers; and the company's already-established track record of delivering results, such as speeding code translation from weeks to days for L3Harris across several projects,"" said Michael Brown, Partner at Shield Capital. Code Metal's automated code translation solutions combine formal methods with AI to ensure every line of code is tested, robust, optimized, and compliant. Its ability to verify and guarantee that code will meet stringent safety and regulatory checks is enabling it to break into otherwise AI-skeptical industries. The company is in the process of closing additional major contracts that will be announced in the coming weeks. ""It's rare to see a company of this technical complexity get adopted this quickly in enterprise. The round was well timed, because there is a huge amount of demand for Code Metal's technology,"" remarked Alexander Harstrick, co-founder of J2 Ventures, which led Code Metal's pre-seed round. ""We have a lot more to share with the world very soon."" About Code Metal Code Metal's mission is to accelerate mission-critical industries with provably correct, automated code translation and optimization for any environment.

Afghanistan bans pharma imports from Pakistan,"CN Taliban regime asks traders to find alternative routes for medicines supply Afghanistan's Taliban regime on Wednesday announced that the import of medicines from Pakistan will be completely banned within the next three months, and urged the local pharmaceutical traders to find alternative supply routes, Afghan media outlets said. Speaking at a meeting with traders and industrialists in Kabul, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the regime's Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs, directed the finance ministry to ensure that no individual or company is allowed to import medicines from Pakistan after the deadline. Baradar criticised the quality of Pakistani medicines, calling them one of the main problems in Afghanistan's health sector. He urged Afghan traders to find alternative supply routes and settle any financial accounts or contracts currently held in Pakistan before the ban takes effect. The decision comes amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, over the use of Afghan soil for launching terrorist attacks in Pakistan. Despite three rounds of talks to ease tensions, the bilateral border trade remained closed. Baradar said that after the three-month period, the Kabul would not cooperate with traders continuing business with Pakistan. He also demanded ""practical guarantees"" from Islamabad that trade routes will not be closed on security or political grounds. Baradar emphasised that Afghanistan now has access to multiple regional trade routes and is working to improve connectivity and infrastructure. He stressed that the issue of trade and refugees must not undermine Afghanistan's economic independence.

42 migrants presumed dead off Libya coast,"PL . At least 42 migrants are missing and presumed dead after a rubber boat capsized off Libya's coast, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Wednesday. Libyan authorities rescued seven survivors who had drifted at sea for six days after the vessel, carrying 49 people, sank near the Al Buri oilfield, north-northwest of the Libyan coast. The migrants were from Sudan, Nigeria, Cameroon, and Somalia, the IOM said. Libya has been a key transit point for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty for Europe since the 2011 fall of Muammar Gaddafi during a NATO-backed uprising. The IOM said the death toll in the central Mediterranean had exceeded 1,000 this year. Across the entire Mediterranean, 2,452 migrants died in 2024, according to IOM data. ""This tragic event, coming just weeks after other deadly incidents off Surman and Lampedusa, underscores the persistent dangers faced by migrants and refugees along the Central Mediterranean Route,"" the agency said.

Afghan economy buckles under hunger and debt,"DE UNDP report warns of worsening poverty as millions of returnees strain fragile public services Afghanistan's economic recovery is faltering as nine in ten households are forced to skip meals, sell belongings or take on debt to survive, the United Nations said on Wednesday, warning that mass returns are worsening the country's deepest crisis since the Taliban's return to power. A United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report said nearly one in ten overseas Afghans has been forced back home, with more than 4.5 million returnees since 2023 — mainly from Iran and Pakistan — swelling the population by 10%. It added that earthquakes, floods, and drought have destroyed 8,000 homes and strained public services 'beyond their limits'. A survey of more than 48,000 households found that over half of Afghanistan's returnees have skipped medical care to buy food, and 45% rely on open springs or unprotected wells for water. Nearly 90% of returning families are in debt, owing between $373 and $900 — up to five times the average monthly income of $100 and nearly half of annual per capita GDP, the UNDP said. In areas with high numbers of returnees, one teacher serves 70 to 100 students, 30% of children work, and joblessness among returnees reaches 95%. The average monthly income is 6,623 Afghanis ($99.76), while rents have tripled. The UNDP warned that without urgent support to strengthen livelihoods and services in high-return areas, overlapping crises of poverty, exclusion, and migration will deepen. It said sustaining aid is critical, as donor pledges have plunged since 2021, covering only a fraction of the $3.1 billion that the UN sought for Afghanistan this year. Participation by women in Afghanistan's labour force has fallen to 6%, one of the lowest globally, and restrictions on movement have made it nearly impossible for women heading households to access jobs, education, or healthcare. ""In some provinces one in four households depend on women as the main breadwinner, so when women are prevented from working, families, communities, the country lose out,"" Kanni Wignaraja, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP regional director for Asia and the Pacific, said.

Shape of Supernova,"GB For first time, scientists see the very early stages of a supernova The explosive death of a star — a supernova — is among the most violent cosmic events, but precisely how this cataclysm looks as it unfolds has remained mysterious. Scientists now have observed for the first time the very early stages of a supernova, with a massive star exploding in a distinctive olive-like shape. The researchers used the European Southern Observatory's Chile-based Very Large Telescope, or VLT, to observe the supernova, which involved a star roughly 15 times the mass of our sun residing in a galaxy called NGC 3621 about 22 million light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Hydra. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). The shape of such explosions has been hard to nail down until now because of how rapidly they take place, so it took quick action with this supernova. The explosion was detected on April 10, 2024, around the time astrophysicist Yi Yang of Tsinghua University in China had landed on a long flight to San Francisco. Yang's formal request just hours later to aim the VLT at the supernova was granted. The researchers thus were able to observe the explosion just 26 hours after the initial detection and 29 hours after material from inside the star first broke through the stellar surface. What they saw was the doomed star surrounded at its equator by a preexisting disk of gas and dust, with the explosion pushing material outward from the stellar core to distort the star's shape into one resembling a vertical-standing olive. The explosion notably did not blow the star apart in a spherical shape. Instead, the explosion pushed violently outward at opposite sides of the star. ""The geometry of a supernova explosion provides fundamental information on stellar evolution and the physical processes leading to these cosmic fireworks,"" said Yang, lead author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. ""The exact mechanisms behind supernova explosions of massive stars, those with more than eight times the mass of the sun, are still debated and are one of the fundamental questions scientists want to address,"" Yang said. Big stars like those live relatively short lives. This one, a type called a red supergiant, was about 25 million years old at the time of its demise.

New Market mural highlights town's unique character,"Artists Ennedi Shtanko, left, of Quicksburg, and Brooke Barrick-Helsley, 19, of New Market, stand in front of the mural they created on this wall at the corner of East Lee Street and Congress Street in New Market. Barrick-Helsley, a graphic design student at James Madison University, designed the mural and Shtanko mentored her on the project. NEW MARKET — In the heart of New Market, on East Lee Street, a new mural is turning heads and celebrating the vibrant spirit of this quaint Shenandoah County town. Painted in collaboration by James Madison University sophomore Brooke Barrick-Helsley and local artist Ennedi Shtanko, the “Highlights of New Market” mural captures the history and culture that bring the town together. New Market Assistant Town Manager Summer Barden said that the premise behind the mural was to capture what makes the town unique. “This has been talked about for at least a couple of years,” she said. “You’ll find images that define New Market, like our golf course, local shops and restaurants, baseball, agriculture, vineyards and the caverns.” Barden said the location on East Lee Street was discussed a few years prior. “With our downtown, we’re kind of limited with open space,” she explained. “But as you’re driving south on Congress Street, this really is the first location that truly opens up from our busy Main Street.” Artists were asked to submit designs they felt captured the heart of the town, she said, noting that 14 artists applied, including a few Shenandoah Valley artists. The selection committee, which included town staff, council members and community representatives, evaluated each design before making its decision. Barrick-Helsley’s design was of giant letters spelling out New Market with each letter depicting a different feature of what makes the town special. “We talked through the strengths and thought about which one would really represent New Market the best. In the end, Brooke’s design was chosen because it tells the story about who we are, past, present and future. Each letter has the imagery tied to New Market. When you look at it, you can get a sense of what makes our town unique right away.” Barrick-Helsley, who is studying graphic design student at JMU, said she learned about the call for artists through the university’s art program. “I’m just so happy I was chosen,” she said, adding that she was grateful to have a mentor like Shtanko beside her through the process. “By sheer luck,” said Shtanko, sharing how she was paired with Barrick-Helsley. “We both applied for the call to artists over the summer,” Shtanko said. “I had a much different design for the wall, but I absolutely see why I missed out on the opportunity to get it.” Shtanko was asked to mentor or collaborate with Barrick-Helsley because it was her first mural design. “I asked, ‘Where do I sign up?’’’ “I couldn’t have asked for anyone better,” gushed Barrick-Helsley with gratitude. “She knows color matching. She’s a genius when it comes to this.” Within the letters that spell out New Market, Barrick-Helsley incorporated coffee beans, which she said represent Jackson’s Corner, known for its rich coffee aroma during roasting. The “W” and “M” highlight local businesses — the Jon Henry General Store and Southern Kitchen, while the “A” depicts the Virginia Museum of the Civil War. “I love the curvature,” Shtanko said. “I love that it makes you stop, actually look and pay attention. When you look at these buildings like an architect, the architecture that went into making New Market is how she thought about creating the mural.” “Through messaging, we really wanted to share that New Market is a welcoming community, with a strong sense of identity,” said Events and Marketing Director Savannah Frazier. “For our residents, it’s a reminder of the pride that we have in our town, our histories and the things that make our daily life special. And for our visitors, we also want it to be an invitation to get to know New Market better.” At a glance, Frazier added, the mural shows New Market is a small town with big character. “We’re rooted in our past, but also moving forward with our energy and creativity,” Frazier said. The mural was completed in three weeks with the help of family, friends and businesses, with most of the painting occurring at night because of the schedules of both artists. “It was challenging,” said Barrick-Helsley. “If I didn’t have her, I think I’d still be trying to figure out how much paint will cover what.” Shtanko, who has always seen herself as someone who enjoys teaching, said the pairing just felt right. “It was the easiest,” she said. “I loved it. Because it was not so much a mentorship but an incredible collaboration. Any time an artist gets an opportunity to put any effort or energy towards something that mass populations are going to see, it’s like, ‘How do I become a part of that?’” Shtanko said there’s just something special about painting a wall that the public will get to see. “The first time we started painting together, we had prepped for so long that the sun had just fallen behind the building,” she said, adding that the painted sunset is reminiscent of that first sunset the duo saw together. “It’s the perfect little reminder of how special this is to us,” she said. — Contact Ashley Miller at amiller@nvdaily.com Log In Keep it Clean.

"2 safe Australian stocks to buy now with $5,000","Image Source: Getty Images You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Safe Australian stocks could be a smart way to invest during this period for investors seeking defensive names for their portfolios. I don't know exactly how the next 12 months or the next few years will play out, but there is a wide range of possible scenarios with AI, geopolitics and other permutations. Below are two of the most defensive businesses on the ASX, which I'd happily buy now with $5,000. This business operates lotteries and Keno in Australia. It holds the exclusive licence to operate all of Australia's state lotteries, except for Western Australia. The company has distribution arrangements with around 4,000 retail outlets nationally, as well as its own digital channels. Additionally, the company operates Keno in a majority of states and territories, except for Western Australia, Tasmania, and the Northern Territory. The business tends to have resilient demand for its products, particularly the lotteries. Being able to buy a little bit of hope seems compelling to customers. The occasional price rise helps drive the company's revenue higher over time, while more sales through digital channels are helping increase margins over time. When broker UBS saw The Lottery Corporation's FY25 result, it forecast that the business could deliver 20% net profit growth in FY26 and grow its net profit by a further 23% between FY26 and FY30. The company's annual dividend is also projected to continue rising in the coming years. In my view, Coles is one of the most defensive businesses on the ASX. As one of Australia's leading supermarket businesses, the food it retails is essential. The company's widespread national network, extended opening hours, e-commerce offerings and varied items are attractive to customers. Coles continues to grow at a pleasing pace compared to Woolworths Group Ltd (ASX: WOW) as it delivers more sales growth. In the first quarter of FY26, the business grew supermarket sales by 4.8% to $9.96 billion. Excluding tobacco, sales revenue increased by 7%. With defensive and growing revenue, I think the business has a promising future of rising profit when added to the benefits of new advanced warehouses and population growth. Broker UBS suggests the business could grow its net profit and dividend each year between FY26 and FY30. That's a great outlook for the company, in my opinion.",2025-11-12 20:08:00,Fool Australia,neutral,0.5873,56,Business_Inflation_Investing," Safe Australian stocks could be a smart way to invest during this period for investors seeking defensive names for their portfolios .

IWT dispute moves forward without India,"US Pakistan to participate in Neutral Expert proceedings on treaty interpretation: FO Pakistan on Wednesday said that it continued to fully participate in good faith in the Neutral Expert proceedings, with its next phase scheduled to take place on November 17-21 in Vienna. ""The Neutral Expert proceedings were initiated on India's request, with their next phase scheduled to take place in Vienna from 17-21 November 2025. While India has decided to halt its participation, Pakistan continues to fully participate in the Neutral Expert proceedings in good faith,"" Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said in a statement. The Hague's Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had issued its Award on Issues of General Interpretation of the IWT on August 8. On September 19, Pakistan initiated an arbitration against India under the provisions of the IWT, which India suspended unilaterally following a four-day conflict between the two countries in May. The PCA on Saturday issued clarifications on its decisions surrounding the treaty in response to the request, which concerned the interpretation and application of the IWT to certain design elements of run-of-river hydroelectric plants (HEPs). The foreign Office spokesperson said that the Neutral Expert had ruled that India's non-participation could not operate as a bar to the proceedings going forward. The spokesperson said that in the context of the arbitration initiated by Pakistan against India under the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), Pakistan had taken note of the recent Decision of the Court of Arbitration which has offered helpful clarification on certain aspects of the Court's 'Award on Issues of General Interpretation of the Indus Waters Treaty', published on 8 August 2025. Pakistan has also taken note of the Procedural Order issued in parallel with the decision which affirms that the Court will continue to conduct these proceedings in a phased manner and would take into account the proceedings taking place before the Neutral Expert under Article IX and Annexure F of the IWT, he added. According to a press release issued by the PCA, the requested clarifications included those in relation to Article III, which concerns the Western rivers, and paragraph 8 of Annexure D, which concerns new run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India may construct on these rivers. ""The award also addressed a related question on the legal effect of decisions issued by dispute resolution bodies under the Treaty (namely, courts of arbitration and neutral experts),"" the press release said. The court found Pakistan's request for clarification to be ""timely"" and provided clarifications as to the meaning and scope of several aspects of its decisions, as well as its reasoning behind them. According to the statement, it also found that its clarifications would have the same binding effect as the original award. The court clarified that its decisions on paragraph 8(a) of Annexure D to the treaty were ""not limited to freeboard but, rather, extend to all components of run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India may construct on the Western rivers"". It also stated that the decisions ""further prohibit any design that would allow the works themselves to be capable of raising artificially the water level in the operating pool above the Full Pondage Level specified in the design"", whether from the outset or via later modifications.

"🥐 Xavi’s self-critique, the Lamine case... 5️⃣ stories to start your day","In partnership with OneFootball ·13 November 2025 The world of football never stops, and this November 13, 2025, leaves us with a landscape full of confessions, public defenses, and emotional memories. From the self-criticism of a legend on the bench, to support among eternal rivals and the commemoration of a somber date, these are the five key points shaping today’s sports agenda. – Wednesday, 12 November 2025 The media spotlight is undoubtedly on the statements of Xavi Hernández. The former FC Barcelona coach, during a conference at ESIC, delivered the self-criticism many had been waiting for. ""My mistake was maintaining those high standards for only one year, from the moment I arrived until we won La Liga, the Super Cup... Later on, I was able to be self-critical,"" confessed Xavi, shedding light on the challenges of his management and the high cost of pressure at an elite club. These words resonate within the Barça environment, always demanding of its figures. – Thursday, 13 November 2025 While the Barça legend reflects, the new generation shows camaraderie. Dean Huijsen, central defender for Real Madrid, came out in defense of Barça’s youth player, Lamine Yamal, amid the commotion over his withdrawal from the national team due to physical discomfort. The Madrid player told Radio Marca that he put aside club colors to prioritize the player’s health. This gesture of sportsmanship is a good example for football. – Wednesday, 12 November 2025 On the other hand, the international stage is marked by emotion. The French National Team plays today against Ukraine, exactly 10 years after the terrorist attacks that shook Paris in 2015. Today’s match is not just a football game, but an emotional tribute where French football keeps the memory and unity alive in the face of tragedy. Security and emotion will be running high on such a significant day. On the technical side, the current Brazil coach, Carlo Ancelotti, gave his ""blessing"" to Xabi Alonso for the future of the Real Madrid bench. In an interview with AS, the Italian did not hesitate to defend the Spaniard’s abilities, assuring that ""I believe Xabi can succeed without any problem"". – Wednesday, 12 November 2025 Finally, women’s football had an intense European night. FC Barcelona showed their power in the Women’s Champions League, giving no chance to OH Leuven ahead of the much-anticipated Clásico. However, the worrying note came from Atlético de Madrid, who complicated their chances against Juventus and suffered a big scare with Andrea Medina, who had to be treated after a heavy blow on the field.

BREAKING: England speedster sent for scans in potential Ashes warm-up disaster,"The England camp faces a nervy wait as speedster Mark Wood was sent for scans on his hamstring after bowling on the opening day of their warm up against the England Lions in Perth. Wood, who has not played a competitive fixture since February due to persistent injury problems, bowled eight wicketless overs at Lilac Hill before leaving the field after experiencing some stiffness in his hamstring. The concern for the England bowling comes only a day after Josh Hazlewood sent a scare through Australia when he went for scans on hamstring as did fellow squad member Sean Abbott during New South Wales’ Sheffield Shield loss to Victoria at the SCG. ﻿Watch The Ashes 2025/26 LIVE and ad-break free during play with FOX CRICK ET on Kayo Sports | New to Kayo? Join now and get your first month for just $1. Hazlewood was cleared to resume his preparations for the first Test, starting next Friday, while Abbott was ruled out with “moderate grade hamstring injury”. Wood’s fate remains unclear, with the English hierarchy surely crossing their fingers that the 35-year-old will be cleared of any significant injury like Hazlewood. The England Cricket Board’s official statement said that is just a precautionary scan with Wood “expected to bowl again in two days time”. However, The Telegraph reports that Wood is “unlikely” to play the first Test due to the scare and given he has not played a first class match for 15 months. Wood this week said that he “wouldn’t say I’m at 100 per cent”, while the game at Lilac Hill was to serve as a fitness test of sorts for the speedster. It’s a test that, regardless of the result of the scan on Friday, has not been passed at 100 per cent either. The Lions were bowled out for 382 in 79.3 overs with all-rounder Will Jacks putting his name forward for Test selection by top scoring with 84 from 85 balls, while Ben McKinney (67), Jordan Cox (53), Thomas Rew (55) and Matthew Potts (53) all struck half centuries. Stumps was called following the fall of the last wicket of the day, and the England hierarchy may have headed straight to the dressing room to re-think the make-up of their attack for the first Test. England skipper Ben Stokes was comfortably the pick of the five-man pace attack the tourists selected for the three day game. Stokes captured a six-wicket haul, including five of the top six batters as he finished with figures of 6/52 from 16 overs. All six of Stokes’ scalps, including highly talented youngster Jacob Bethell, came via mistimed cross bat shots from back of length or short deliveries on a reportedly benign pitch. England asked Joe Root to shoulder the spin bowling load with Shoaib Bashir selected in the Lions side, and the champion batter was smacked around the park, finishing with figures of 1/117 from only 14 overs. Jofra Archer (1/49), Gus Atkinson (1/62) and Josh Tongue (1/63) all picked up a wicket each, but the treatment of Root by the Lions batters will cause great concern for Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum. Bashir and Jacks will be eager to bowl well tomorrow to push their cases forward for the series opener in eight days’ time.",2025-11-13 08:04:00,Fox Sports,negative,0.5955,68,Overs_Ball_Sports, Mark Wood was sent for scans on his hamstring after bowling on the opening day of England Lions warm-up in Perth .

AI bottlenecks: Q&A on the obstacles to an economic boom,"AI Bottlenecks: A Q&A with Georgios Petropoulos on Obstacles to an Economic Boom AI Bottlenecks: A Q&A with Georgios Petropoulos on Obstacles to an Economic Boom Assistant Professor Georgios Petropoulos discusses his research on artificial intelligence bottlenecks and the factors preventing the technology from catalyzing an economic surge. [iStock Photo] Artificial intelligence (AI) is permeating throughout the business world, from communications to data analysis to financial planning. So why hasn’t the hyper-efficient technology resulted in a surge in productivity and economic growth? In his paper, “Artificial Intelligence: Increasing Labour Productivity in a Responsible Way,” Georgios Petropoulos, assistant professor of data sciences and operations, and his co-author Mamta Kupar (Accenture) discusses the AI productivity paradox: a slowdown in productivity despite advancements in digital technology. The assistant professor also explores the obstacles, or bottlenecks, preventing a potential economic boom. In the following conversation, Petropoulos defines these bottlenecks and proposes solutions to catalyze growth, collaboration, and equal opportunity in the world of AI. Interviewer: Could you explain the concept of AI bottlenecks? Georgios Petropoulos: When we look at productivity statistics to see how AI affects the economy, using standard methodologies, we see that it did not have much effect so far. Some colleagues have named it as an “AI productivity paradox.” My research is about how AI can help society, how it can help the economy, and how we can get more benefits from AI. AI bottlenecks refer to important obstacles in the wide diffusion of AI technologies. If we address the AI bottlenecks, AI will be adopted widely across many more corporations and only then will we be able to see the aggregate positive impact that can significantly improve our lives and our living standards. What are those bottlenecks? GP: They are obstacles related to key inputs that make AI work. There are three key inputs that I’m studying in particular: Let’s start with the first bottleneck — AI talent. Basically, this is translated as skill shortages. If we look at job postings data over the period 2010–2019, more than 26% of AI talent is taken by just 10 firms. We have an AI talent shortage for the rest of the firms. In order to adopt AI, we need to achieve a better distribution of AI talents. We need to remove the skill shortages and allow firms to be able to find the talent they need in order to innovate. How do we achieve that? We need to put a multidimensional policy approach into play. We need to talk about education and how we can reform education. We can talk about training programs which help people to readjust and build on the already acquired skills and bring more context in the AI era. We can talk about labor mobility, how easy it is to move from one country to another or from one company to another. Of course, immigration policies can also be relevant here to guarantee that US firms, especially small firms, can also bring AI talent from abroad. Then there’s the second bottleneck, which is data concentration. Many of the big firms have organized platform ecosystems where the big tech firm has a central role in collecting information from users. By being in the center, they have a great information advantage, which they also can monetize in different ways. This presents a big question: Should these firms keep their data for themselves? Who owns this data? One idea that we put forward has to do with developing data sharing mechanisms so that these big firms share this information with smaller firms that participate in this ecosystem. By receiving data that is relevant to their business focus and the value proposition, they can use this information to train their AI systems and make them better in order to deliver better services and products. If we create markets for data, of course we need to fully respect the privacy rules and principles. We should empower the users to have more control over the personal data. Instead of control by the big tech platforms, it is the user that should decide how to use their data and whether they would like to share their data with some other firm than the big platform. The third bottleneck refers to the investment and infrastructure cost should take a more traditional economic approach. We need to rely on insights from the economics of innovation to incentivize firms to undertake larger cost investments in order to build the proper infrastructure and invest in the computing power necessary for their AI systems to run and produce efficient results. The co-investment model that has traditionally applied in telecommunication networks can also be relevant here for how we can make it work in this context. How do you address these bottlenecks? Through policy? Regulation? GP: We need to think carefully about the policy tools that are relevant here. One important aspect of AI is that it is a general-purpose technology which means it has a pervasive impact to many different industries, to many different contexts. That means the policy tools should be multidimensional. First of all, we need to understand what is the key challenge or problem and then to make sure we address it in a sufficient way. On one hand, the firms that are front runners in creating or using these AI technologies should not be discouraged from doing it. At the same time, we need the smaller players to have equal chances to get access to these technologies and use them in an efficient way to deliver a better output and achieve successful market outcomes. That should be the objective of policy tools and potential regulations. How do you balance the integration of AI with concerns over automation? GP: One of the biggest concerns has to do with the future of work. In order to make the new AI-enabled production model succeed, we need a participative approach where automation and AI technologies are introduced only in complementary ways with human work. We don’t need to automate everything because this does not guarantee that we will have superior results than a model in which we have a complementary function of humans and AI. Even Elon Musk has admitted that the excessive automation in Tesla was a mistake. We should not automate just to automate. That should be an important lesson for corporations as they move forward in this digital transformation and try to innovate, make their production processes more efficient, and produce higher quality products and services. Humans are still very valuable in this process. In the age of generative and agentic AI systems, we need to make sure that human judgment and opinion are freely shaped and they are not manipulated by these systems. We created AI to serve humanity. Manipulation of human behavior is a great risk and we should develop some safeguards to ensure that it is the human judgment and opinion that prevail when we use these systems to reach some decisions — especially, since AI hallucinations are not uncommon.

However, when I come to visit, it is to spend time with my brother and help him with eating, bathing, getting dressed, etc. That typically happens in the mornings and at night, when visitors are expected to be at a hotel. Out-of-state visitors could also help with cooking, cleaning and anything else that needs to be done. We don’t expect to be catered to. Paying for airfare, dog-sitters and a hotel each time I visit is a financial barrier. My brother is dying, and it feels like family is not actually welcome to visit or help him. Am I out of line for thinking my sister-in-law should get over herself and allow family to stay at the house in order to be with my brother? Is there even a good way to broach the subject with her? -- DEFLATED IN CALIFORNIA DEAR DEFLATED: I am sorry for your pain, but I do think you are out of line. While I admire your willingness to sacrifice to help your brother and sister-in-law through this difficult period, you all would be better served if you told them you are willing to do anything they need IF ASKED.

Asking Eric: Ex husband struggles with being in the ‘weird un-friend’ space. ‘I hate this’,"Dear Eric: My ex and I are on good terms. I wouldn’t say we’re friends just yet. It’s kinda new. We separated two years ago, and we got divorced about eight months ago. We keep in contact a little but it’s not like a TV show where we’re buddy buddy. I’m sad about this because I like her a lot. We were together for 12 years, from our early 20s to our mid-30s. So, we learned a lot about life together. She’s expressed an interest in being friends but, in our relationship, I was always the person who kept in contact with people, had people over, planned poker nights or the fantasy football league. I can’t help but think that maybe she’s lonely and I should try harder to build a friendship with her. Mostly I just hate being in this weird un-friend space. Maybe that’s just being divorced? Am I overthinking this? – Not Quite Friends Dear Friends: Better to be overthinking than to be overdoing in this case. You’re looking for an action, something to do to get you out of the way you feel. And it sounds like that energy has landed on your ex. But your ex is not a project and, for now, you should leave her be. Friendship after a relationship is very different from new friendship. With a new friendship, sometimes it’s helpful to be a little vocal about a desire to build something meaningful. Sometimes you have to be intentional about establishing a pattern of hangouts. Sometimes you have to be the convener of the fantasy football league. But after a relationship, it can be helpful to give yourselves the space and time to re-learn not only who you are but who you can be together. You write that you fear your ex is lonely. Respectfully, and kindly, that’s not something you should be responsible for. And is it possible that you’re lonely? And you’re used to filling your time (and your home) with activities, friends and events? It might be helpful to call the “un-friend” space by a different name. This is going to sound harsh but bear with me. Right now, you’re not friends. You’re exes. That is a full and complex relationship on its own. It may not be like this forever. But it’s enough for right now. Lean on your other friends and wish her well. From afar. Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O. Box 22474, Philadelphia, PA 19110.

Two dead and 18 injured as truck ploughs into crowds at busy market,"A tragic incident occurred at a busy outdoor market when a lorry plowed into crowds, resulting in two fatalities and injuring at least 18 others. The emergency services were immediately dispatched to the scene in Bucheon city, located within the Seoul metropolitan area of South Korea, on Thursday. The driver of the lorry, believed to be a man in his 60s, is currently being questioned by the police, according to a Bucheon police official. Initial reports from Park Geum-cheon, an official at Bucheon's fire station, indicate that the lorry first reversed before driving forward for nearly 500 feet, hitting pedestrians. The driver was rescued after being trapped in the vehicle. He drove into the sidewalk at around 10.55am local time on Thursday. According to the Korean news outlet Xinhua News, the man said that the truck's brakes failed. He had driven around 100 meters into the market before crashing into a storefront and coming to a stop, reports the Daily Star. The driver has been booked under charges of negligent homicide and injury under the Traffic Accident Special Act. Jin Mo, a 43-year-old seller at the market, said: ""I was eating inside the store when I heard screams outside, followed by a loud noise as a car passed by and crashed with a bang."" Police are questioning the unidentified truck driver. He is believed not to have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, said Son Byeong-sam, a police official in Bucheon. Emergency officials said two people suffered cardiac arrest and fell unconscious after the truck crashed into the market. A total of 20 people have been injured in the incident. The two people killed in the crash were both women in their 70s, according to police. The driver of the truck blamed a sudden surge of acceleration for the crash, a fire official told a televised briefing. The driver was not intoxicated when officers tested him for alcohol, police have said. The truck will be over to investigators as they work to determine the cause of the crash.

‘We’re in it for the fight’: State school teachers rally outside Parliament,"Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Peter Haffenden is standing with hundreds of fellow state school teachers outside Parliament House, in inner-Brisbane, shortly after 4.30pm on Thursday. The humanities teacher says he frequently spends weekends, holidays, and nights marking work, preparing lessons, and planning curriculum. “I’ve been teaching 35 years and the workload’s probably gone up by a factor of five … I never get a chance to really spend time with my family because I’m working at home so much,” Haffenden said. Teachers Andrew Weber (left) and Peter Haffenden (right) said workloads had increased over the more than three decades both men had been teachers.Credit: Catherine Strohfeldt Fellow Brisbane region teacher Andrew Weber estimated a normal working week demanded about 45 to 50 hours’ work, but said during marking periods the hours spent on teaching tasks skyrocketed. “It’s obviously weekends, it’s obviously nights, it’s holidays … for instance, I’ve got to do probably 10 to 12 hours of drafts this weekend,” he said. Thursday’s rally was a warm-up for Queensland Teachers’ Union (QTU) members, who are planning to strike before the end of the school term on December 12. Last week the QTU backed down from a 24-hour work ban, having earlier promised to strike within three weeks of rejecting the state’s last wage offer. Union president Cresta Richardson said a strike was still on the table, and a date could be set as early as next week after the union executive met on Monday. “Continuing to maintain pressure publicly is really important, and rallies do that,” Richardson said. “However, we are still in conciliation and being in conciliation means that we can take protected industrial action up until the end of the year. Teachers rally outside Queensland Parliament House in Brisbane.Credit: Catherine Strohfeldt “We didn’t think that it would be like this, but ... we’re in it for the long term, and we’re in it for the fight.” However, Richardson said the QTU was prepared to cancel the planned second strike if the government agreed to alter its arbitration terms. After members voted down the state’s last pay offer two-to-one in late October, the Education Department began preparing for arbitration, seeking to redraft the entire enterprise bargaining agreement before the Queensland Industrial Court. In return, the union asked the state to only consider the terms the two parties could not agree upon, including pay, attraction and retention schemes, and workplace safety measures. The QTU also wanted an interim 3 per cent increase in teachers’ pay in 2026, estimating a full arbitration could take two years, during which time teachers would see their pay only increase if it dipped below award levels. On Thursday, Richardson said it would be an “onerous task”, potentially renegotiating conditions that had been in place for more than 20 years, such as caps on classroom sizes. In a letter dated November 7, Education Department director-general Sharon Schimming told the QTU the government would not agree to anything before the two parties met again in court. Once arbitration begins all industrial action will be unprotected.

Pivot Bio Expands Weatherproof Nitrogen Portfolio with New Dry Planter Box Treatments for Corn and Cotton,"New planter box treatments for Pivot Bio PROVEN® G3 and Pivot Bio CERT-N™ add application flexibility and micronutrient delivery for 2026, expanding early-season access to reliable, weatherproof nitrogen. MINNEAPOLIS, Nov. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Pivot Bio, one of the world's leading innovative agtech companies, today announced the launch of new dry planter box treatments for its nitrogen-fixing technology, Pivot Bio PROVEN® G3 Dry for corn and Pivot Bio CERT-N™ Dry for cotton, giving farmers another convenient, reliable way to apply the company's exclusive, proprietary gene-edited microbes at planting. The new dry application delivers Pivot Bio's weatherproof nitrogen directly in the planter box, combining the same locked-in microbial nitrogen performance with a premium dry carrier that includes micronutrients to support early growth and root development. Both products integrate seamlessly with existing planting practices and maintain the same agronomic performance as their liquid and seed treatment counterparts. With three application formats now available, Pivot Bio reinforces its position as one of the most well-rounded biological portfolios on the market, one that supports farmer choice and flexibility across different production systems. ""Our microbes are designed to do one thing exceptionally well — fix nitrogen on the root, right where the plant needs it,"" said Travis Frey, Ph.D., Chief Technology Officer at Pivot Bio. ""By anchoring nitrogen to the root system, we're giving farmers a third, more predictable source of nitrogen that complements traditional fertilizer programs. PROVEN G3 delivers multiple modes of action that feed, boost, and amplify corn crop performance, while CERTN extends that same reliability to cotton acres. These dry formulations make it even easier for farmers to access consistent nitrogen performance in every pass of the planter."" Performance Backed by Data Across farms nationwide, Pivot Bio PROVEN® G3 continues to deliver strong yield performance and consistency across a wide range of growing conditions, all while costing growers about 30 percent less per acre than synthetic nitrogen inputs. CERT-N has also shown strong performance in cotton trials, helping growers supplement up to 20 percent of their nitrogen program and achieve up to a 50-pound lint increase per acre. ""The 2025 season tested the resilience of every farmer. We saw everything from prolonged dry spells to early-season deluges, conditions where nutrients can be lost,"" said Ryan Van Roekel, Ph.D., and Director of Commercial Agronomy for Pivot Bio. ""The harvest data that is rolling in is unequivocal. Our next-generation technology is delivering critical nutrition precisely when and where the crop needs it, regardless of the weather."" Available Now for the 2026 Season Both dry products are available now through Pivot Bio's commercial and retail networks while supplies last, with strong early demand expected to sell out for the 2026 planting season. Growers can contact their local Pivot Bio representative for availability and details on recommended use. ""We are excited to be launching a new way for farmers to experience the benefits of Pivot Bio's exclusive, proprietary gene-edited microbes that deliver the most efficient, weatherproof nitrogen year in and year out,"" said Rick Myroup, Senior Director of Product Management at Pivot Bio. ""Introducing a new application method for PROVEN G3 and CERT-N demonstrates our commitment to providing innovative solutions that fit farmers' operations and bring new value and ROI to their acres.""

"Asking Eric: I want to visit my parents, but not if they insist on including my estranged brother","Dear Eric: I am in my late 30s. I live halfway across the country from my parents, and don’t have the best relationship with them. I also have a brother four years younger than me who I have been estranged from for 20 years. My brother doesn’t live with my parents, but he lives in the same city my parents do. If I visit, my parents will tell him and have him come over. I have no intentions of reconciling with him, as he did some horrible things to me 20 years ago which I can never forgive him for. With my parents, things don’t get through unless I take drastic measures. How do I go about conveying my desires not to see him? My plan would be to tell them they have to tell him he can’t come to their house while I’m there, and if they don’t respect my wishes, I simply won’t see them. And that my parents can’t just say they want to see me and not respect my conditions for the visit. I wanted your perspective on how I can “lay down the law” and enforce it. – Unwelcome Home Dear Home: As “School House Rock” (and, ideally, civics class) taught us, there’s a lot of discussion that comes before a bill becomes a law. I like to think that similar processes can be helpful before “laying down the law.” You don’t have to discuss or negotiate your internal boundaries. But conflict can often arise from a misalliance between our boundaries and others’ actions. We can only control the former. Before giving your parents an ultimatum, it may help you and them to ask them why they keep inviting your brother to their home when you visit. This discussion also gives you the chance to explain, again, what is and isn’t doable for you. “Because of our history, it’s uncomfortable and distressing to be in the same space as him. To protect myself, I am choosing not. I want to see you, but I can’t come if he’s going to be here. Can you respect and love me enough to keep our visits just us?” Framing it as a question doesn’t box them in, but it doesn’t require you to give up anything that’s important to you here. Additionally, presenting it to them this way keeps the conversation from drifting. You don’t need to defend your decisions (and, in this context, they don’t either). Instead, you can both focus on what’s possible moving forward. If they say that they can’t respect what you’re asking, tell them you’re sorry they feel this way but, as you stated, to protect yourself you have to stay away from him. Leave the door open for them to visit you or to change their minds. Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O. Box 22474, Philadelphia, PA 19110.

He took them camping every year in their trailer, cheered them on at countless BMX races, soccer, basketball, and football games, and even coached baseball for several seasons. In 1990, Gino took on a unique project purchasing the historic Bittenbender house for just one dollar. He removed the roof and interior walls and relocated the structure to 211 South Spring Street, where it found new life. This endeavor was a testament to his resourcefulness and determination. Gino loved his family deeply, and he had a special place in his heart for all of his dogs. He was a man of quiet strength, unwavering loyalty, and gentle humor. His legacy lives on in the lives of his children, the memories he created, and the values he instilled. He will be remembered for his kindness, his craftsmanship, and the love he gave so freely.

Mel DeWeerd,"Birth: 1934 Death: 2025 November 11, 1934 – October 31, 2025 Mel DeWeerd passed away peacefully with his wife Pam by his side on October 31, 2025, just shy of 91 years old. Born on Veterans Day in Hudsonville, Michigan, Mel liked to say that when he was a boy, he thought the national holiday was for his birthday — a story that always brought a smile to those who knew him. The youngest of four children, Mel endured great tragedy at just eight years old when his father, older brother, and uncle drowned in a fishing accident. Two years later, he faced another challenge when struck by a car while riding his bicycle, breaking both femurs. He spent a full year in the hospital, confined to traction, and was told he would never walk again. But through perseverance and prayer, Mel recovered. Within six months of returning home, his doctor saw his muscles growing stronger and told him he no longer needed crutches — and Mel walked once more. That experience shaped the quiet strength, humility, and gratitude that defined his life. While attending high school and later Hope College, Mel worked at his late father’s garage, repairing radiators and pumping gas. His early love for cars and people naturally led him into sales — first selling school furniture for American Seating, where his Alaska territory took him across remote villages by bush plane and even to nights spent sleeping in post offices. Mel married his first wife shortly after college, and together they had two sons, Todd and Traig, whom he adored. After several years in Portland and Seattle, that marriage ended in divorce. Mel then settled in Marin County, California, where he began a new chapter both professionally and personally. At this time, he worked in sales for Herman Miller, selling office furniture. In 1968, on a blind date, Mel met the love of his life, Pam Stoddard. Two years later they married and shared 55 years of deep devotion, laughter, and adventure. Mel joined SICO, Inc., selling portable dance floors, tables, and stages to hotels, convention centers, and colleges — a role that perfectly suited his charm, quick wit, and talent for connecting with people. He was known to be a good listener with the unique skill of being incredibly engaged, coupled with practical advice on how to help. He retired at age 60, proud of a career built on integrity and genuine relationships. Mel and Pam made their homes in Mill Valley, Kentfield, and eventually Stinson Beach, where they enjoyed retirement together with their beloved dachshunds — all with names beginning with “P.” He loved collecting antiques, attending the opera, and managing his real estate investments with care and pride. Together they shared a lifetime of travel and adventure, exploring the world from Africa to China, Europe, South America, and beyond. They were true partners — deeply devoted and forever grateful for the love they found. A dedicated husband, father, and grandfather, Mel was known for his humor, humility, and kindness. He had a generous heart and an unwavering loyalty to the people he loved. He was a gifted listener, an astute investor, and a man who found beauty and joy in life’s simple and grand moments alike. Mel is survived by his loving wife, Pam DeWeerd; sons Todd DeWeerd (Melissa) and Traig Van Dyke (Mildred); granddaughter Jena DeWeerd; in laws Joyce DeWeerd as well as Helen Chadsey, Jeff VanDyke (Heidi); nieces and nephews in Michigan; and nieces Cori McClaughry and Wendy Blymyer, nephew Scott Stoddard. He is also survived by in-laws Dee Stoddard, Kirk & Sue Stoddard and his devoted caregiver Sam Naqase, who cared for him with compassion for nearly five years. Many thanks to Hospice by the Bay who supported Mel and his family. There will be a memorial to celebrate his life on January 31, 2026 at 2pm at the Stinson Beach Community Center. For those who wish to honor Mel, he would have appreciated a donation to the Stinson Beach Volunteer Fire Department, whose care and dedication meant so much to him.

Three Nigerians arrested for fraud in Kenya,"A report by Tuko News, a Kenyan digital news platform, revealed that the suspects were apprehended by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations on Wednesday. The arrested individuals have been identified as Peter Chukwujekwu, Alazor Chukulute Sunday, and Nnalue Chiagozie Samwe. According to the report on Thursday, the trio were flushed out of their apartment after members of the public raised concerns about suspicious late-night activities in the building. The DCI confirmed the arrests, stating that they occurred during “a multi-agency raid targeting a cyber fraud ring” in the area. The report quoted the DCI as saying: “Three Nigerian nationals nabbed in Kirinyaga multi-agency raid. A well-coordinated multi-agency raid in Mwaliko Estate within Mwea town has blown the lid off a suspected cyber fraud ring operated by three Nigerian nationals.” The suspects, who claimed to be running an online business, were said to be living in Kenya illegally and lacked valid work permits. This arrest is part of a broader trend of Nigerians being apprehended abroad for various criminal activities, including cyber fraud, drug trafficking, and human trafficking. In June 2023, Kenyan police arrested 19 Nigerians in Nairobi for engaging in electronic fraud targeting Kenyans. According to the DCI, the men, aged between 19 and 33, used social media to initiate their scam, swindling unsuspecting Kenyans under the guise of offering goods deliveries from abroad. “The fraudsters start by befriending you on social media (Facebook), and once you accept the friend request, they initiate a friendly chat that promises the victim goodies to be sent through DHL at the airport,” the DCI explained.",2025-11-14 08:05:00,Nigeria News,neutral,0.7804,78,Nationals_Early_Targeting," The suspects were apprehended by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations on Wednesday .

"With early tests now passed, Ireland go in search of World Cup progression","Ireland’s Jaden Umeh and head coach Colin O'Brien. Pic: Inpho Two wins and a draw earned Colin O'Brien's Republic of Ireland under-17s top spot in Group J and a Round of 32 clash with Canada at the World Cup in Qatar. So what will the knockout phase bring that the group stage didn't? O'Brien spoke post-Paraguay of how ""cup football"" awaits following their successful navigation of the group stage. That win-or-go-home pressure also awaits. Head coach O'Brien acknowledged the experience collected thus far - be that the occasion, the Doha heat, officials, or opposition tactics. For the Cork native, it has given his players plenty of knowledge in terms of how they best go about the Round of 32 and possibly beyond. ""We've gathered so much info from the tournament, how it works, everything around it,"" O'Brien said. ""The supporters, some of the officials. So the players have a lot of information now. ""They're probably being educated now on how to deal with certain things. Early in the games, they might get frustrated with certain things. It's our job as a staff to say: 'Right, this is what you might have to do in a certain situation. This is what's happening with a player, or happening with an official.' ""It's very important that it doesn't break their concentration. As we always talk about, there are no excuses. ""We still have to go out and perform. There are going to be times in the game when we might have to defend. I think every facet of the game now we've been tested in."" O'Brien insists that in-game know-how and quality will be crucial going forward. He has seen improvement across all aspects of his side's play. Leaders like Vinnie Leonard, Michael Noonan, Rory Finneran and Jaden Umeh have stood up when needed. ""I have to give it to them (the squad), they stand up,"" O'Brien said. ""Even when we mightn't be getting that rhythm in our game, at times we might not have that fluidity we want. We feel we've got better in different aspects of the games. We can play when we need to play. If we have to stand up and fight, we can. If we need to be a little bit direct, we can. ""We've improved our counter-attack plan. We've got better with set plays. ""That's the game. It's trying to give them that broad and balanced outlook because it could be one of those functions where you need to be really, really good on, whether it's in the transitions or in and out of possession. ""You need to be good in all areas."" Much has been made of the senior football minutes played by several Ireland players, and notably by Dundalk's Leonard and Shamrock Rovers' Noonan throughout the group stages. The latter's street smarts were on full show in closing out the Uzbekistan victory. ""Michael - like a good number of players in the squad - would have always had that, but what he's done from his club, it's been really harnessed as well, it's been so invaluable,"" O'Brien added. ""Once you play senior football and you're around really good staff who give you good information and educate you around that side of the game. ""But again, it's the senior players within those clubs, they're the players that really school the younger players. They put their arm around them, they'll give a little kick if they need it at times. You can see that.

Elizabeth (Beth) Schwebel,"Birth: 1937 Death: 2025 Betsy Anne Ironside was born on the Fourth of July in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Elsworth and Marie Ironside. Independent from the start, she believed in listening to her heart and following where it led. As a young woman, she adventurously explored Europe with friends before moving to Los Angeles to experience life in a bigger city. There, while working in a dental office, she met her future husband, Sheldon. Together they moved north to San Francisco, then to Corte Madera, where they married in 1962. Beth often said that when she first saw Mt. Tamalpais, she knew they had found their home — their own Brigadoon revealed as the fog lifted on the drive from Mill Valley to Corte Madera. Beth wrote that raising a family was the most meaningful part of her life. She and Sheldon had two sons, Keith and Brent. She left her job at Shel’s dental practice–a role she found deeply satisfying because it allowed her to help others–to devote herself to their upbringing. Her spirit of service continued in the wider community: she taught dental health in Marin schools through the Dental Auxiliary College and helped expand a local meal delivery program for seniors from just a few meals to more than 250 a day. A devoted friend and community member, Beth built lasting connections through her warmth, humor, and involvement, with many friends, and with the Community Congregational Church of Tiburon. Spiritually, she described herself as a “seeker,” moving beyond the Catholic church of her youth to reform congregations that reflected her values of compassion, inclusion, and personal faith. Beth loved nature and worked to protect the environment, believing passionately in stewardship of the earth and action against climate change. She also lived her belief that all people deserve equal opportunity regardless of religion, race, or gender. Her acceptance and love for others were unconditional–when her granddaughter came out as gay, Beth embraced her wholly and without hesitation. In all things, Beth brought care, sincerity, and playfulness. She could brighten a dark day with one of her special hugs, a lively game of cribbage, or a well-timed Ole and Lena joke. She passed away full of love and without regret, leaving behind a legacy of kindness, strength, and joy. Beth will be dearly missed by her husband, Sheldon; her sons, Keith and Brent; and her grandchildren, Charlotte, Georgia, Jack, and Cole, as well as the many friends whose lives she touched. A Celebration of Life will be held on Saturday, November 15, at 4:00 p.m. at the Community Congregational Church of Tiburon.

COUGAR NOTES: WSU searches for an AD as Pac-12 finds third media rights partner,"The Washington State world was shaken to its core on Wednesday when WSU President Elizabeth Cantwell announced that the school and Anne McCoy, its 24-year employee and athletic director of 18 months, were parting ways. A day later, the Pac-12 finalized a media deal with USA Network on Thursday — its third broadcast partner for football and basketball. And in other Cougar news, the WSU football and men’s and women’s basketball programs secured several more commitments this week, including a hooper from Klay Thompson’s high school. Pac-12 partners with USA Sports The Pac-12 Conference inked a deal with USA Sports, a subsidiary of NBCUniversal/Comcast. USA Sports includes all sports programming on USA Network, The Golf Channel and CNBC. USA Network, available in about 70 million U.S. households, joins CBS/Paramount+, CBS Sports Network and The CW Network as Pac-12 broadcast partners. Financial details for the deal were not announced. The Pac-12’s events on USA Network will include 22 regular-season football games, 50 men’s basketball games, 5-10 women’s basketball games and the bulk of the men’s basketball conference tournament, excluding the championship, which will air on CBS. The deal begins when the new conference officially forms next summer and runs through the 2030-31 school year. “The new Pac-12 is where tradition meets transformation — a unique opportunity in the rapidly evolving college sports landscape that strongly aligns with the go-forward vision of USA Sports,” Pac-12 Commissioner Teresa Gould said in a statement. Pac-12 Enterprises, which formerly produced the Pac-12 Network, will handle the production operations for games on USA. The entity will produce more than 150 events between its three partners. Football and men’s basketball conference championship games will get a major national audience on CBS and stream on Paramount+. The CW and USA will handle the bulk of regular-season games between football and men’s basketball. Pac-12 women’s basketball will see 5-10 games on USA, while The CW will get 15 regular-season games, the conference tournament semifinals and championship game. One key selling point for fans is that USA Network will announce all of its kickoff times when the football schedule debuts in the first quarter of 2026, according to Pac-12 insider John Canzano. WSU searches for new AD Multiple pundits, including Canzano and fellow Pac-12 insider Jon Wilner of the Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.), cast McCoy’s firing as a clear illustration of Cantwell’s greater expectations for WSU and a firm desire for the Cougars to win. After all, Cantwell spent her weekend in Spokane telling a room full of WSU supporters that the Cougars were last in the soon-to-expand Pac-12 in name, image and likeness dollars and that she intended to change that, according to CougFan. Four days later, Cantwell chose to find a new leader for her athletic department. While WSU did not provide an official reason for the leadership change, a glance between the lines certainly suggests what WSU will want from its new AD. WSU launched a national search for an athletic director. Perhaps the Cougars will return to a familiar face in Toledo AD Bryan Blair. Blair joined former AD Pat Chun’s WSU athletic administrative team in 2018 and ascended to chief operating officer and deputy director of athletics by his 2022 departure. In his fundraising capacity, Blair was responsible for securing 50 of the top 70 biggest gifts in WSU history. Other names to know include Purdue deputy athletic director Ken Halpin, Montana State AD Leon Costello and Maryland senior deputy AD Diana Saubau. Haplin has a master’s degree from Gonzaga and a doctorate from WSU, Costello has nearly tripled athletic-related giving in Bozeman, Mont., and Saubau was Cantwell’s AD at Utah State. As Maryland’s No. 2 athletic administrator, Saubau is unlikely to leave that post. Still, the prior relationship between the president and AD may hold some weight or give Cantwell some headway in the search. No matter who the Cougars choose, they will certainly gravitate toward a leader capable of raising enough funds to elevate WSU’s financial situation and contend with the highest earners in the new Pac-12, including Boise State, Oregon State and Gonzaga. Recruiting updates The WSU football program fended off multiple Power Four schools to secure its two latest commitments this week. John Johnson III of New Orleans’ Edna Karr High School chose Wazzu after decommitting from Liberty over offers from the Big Ten’s Nebraska and Tulane, among others. WSU listed Johnson as a wide receiver in its recruitment graphic, but the 6-foot, 180-pound athlete has been a dual-threat quarterback for Edna Karr this year, leading his school to a 10-0 overall record, while passing for nearly 1,000 yards and rushing for 400 in October alone. Johnson is the second athlete from Edna Karr in WSU’s class of 2026, joining running back Tre Garrison. Earlier in the week, WSU beat out Arizona, Colorado and Boise State for offensive lineman Derek Worden, from Queen Creek, Ariz. Worden shares a hometown with WSU senior center Brock Dieu and is listed at 6-5, 280. WSU’s ’26 class includes 24 athletes ahead of the Dec. 3-5 early signing window. On the hardwood, WSU added its first men’s basketball recruit of the ’26 class. Brayden Kyman, a 6-5, 195-pound power forward, hails from Santa Margarita High School (Calif.), which is also where Klay Thompson, NBA superstar and prominent WSU alum, grew up and played prep hoops. Kyman is familiar with WSU coach David Riley thanks to his older brother, Jake Kyman, who played his senior season for Riley at Eastern Washington. WSU women’s basketball signed Reese Jordan, a 5-9 guard from West Linn, Ore. Jordan averaged 15.8 points and six rebounds per game last season in Oregon’s 6A classification. She held offers from Nevada, Cal State Bakersfield and Portland State.

😳 What’s going on with them? Germany all at sea in Luxembourg,"For the German national team, it is absolutely clear that today's match must be won. So far, Julian Nagelsmann's protégés are having a bit of a hard time at Stade de Luxembourg. In the first quarter of an hour, it became really tense for national goalkeeper Baumann. After a through pass from Dardari to Barreiro, the former Mainz player passed the ball to St. Pauli playmaker Sinani, who narrowly missed the goal. In the 18th minute, the next highlight occurred. After a dribble, FCA player Dardari narrowly missed the German goal. Just a few minutes earlier, the Luxembourgers had come dangerously close to the German goal. David Raum was able to clear before a shot was taken. After a weak first half, the German team managed to turn things around. In the 49th minute, Nick Woltemade scored the 1:0.

"Povorcitinib Improves Itch, Hive CSU Symptoms Within 3 Days, With Weilly Soong, MD","In this Q&A, Soong discusses phase 2 results on povorcitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor that provides rapid relief from chronic spontaneous urticaria symptoms. At the 2025 American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (ACAAI) Annual Scientific Meeting in Orlando, Weilly Soong, MD, from AllerVie Health – Homewood in Birmingham, AL, presented phase 2 data showing povorcitinib provides rapid Improvement in hives and itch in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Povorcitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor that blocks IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, and IL-6, improved itch and hives within 3 days and had a favorable safety profile. As a part of HCPLive’s on-site coverage of the meeting, HCPLive sat down with Soong to discuss the significance of these findings and what they mean for clinicians. In this Q&A, Soong shares when patients began experiencing meaningful symptom improvements, why the need for new effective therapies in CSU is so pressing, and the future direction of povorcitinib research. HCPLive: Can you summarize the key findings from this study on povorcitinib for chronic spontaneous urticaria? Soong: In the 75 mg dose of povorcitinib, we saw an improvement of 22 percent change [from baseline in the] UASa7, which was statistically significant. It had a very rapid itch [improvement] within the first 2 to 3 days. HCPLive: How quickly did patients begin to experience meaningful improvements in hives and itch, and how do these response times compare to current treatment options? Soong: Overall, [the] urticaria score was low by day 3. Compared to [other] biologics like omalizumab and dupilumab, it works a lot faster. But [compared] to a BTK, it's roughly the same. One of the BTK inhibitors is remibrutinib. However, there [have] not been any head-to-head studies amongst them, so you can't quite make that comparison. HCPLive: Why is the need for new effective therapies in CSU so pressing, particularly for patients refractory to antihistamines or biologics? Soong: Currently, there's a very much huge unmet need in the CSU area. There are a lot of patients [who] do not want to [start] a biological therapy because maybe [they] just started having CSU. A lot of people think that CSU is triggered by external triggers, and so they're trying to find something in their environment that might be causing their urticaria. Some people think it may be due to foods, detergents, soaps, [or] activities. And so, they often are very miserable with their urticaria and very resistant to doing something like a biologic. This is the reason why there's a huge unmet need. HCPLive: Povorcitinib is an oral selective inhibitor. What role does this pathway play in the pathophysiology of CSU, and how might targeting it differ from current biologic therapies? Soong: We know that chronic spontaneous urticaria is a disorder of mast cells, and the mast cells are unpredictably firing and releasing histamine and causing hives. We know that there are autoantibodies and autoallergenic antibodies that turn on these cells. What the JAK inhibitor does is that it helps block the production of these cells. It also works on some of the itch pathways that are seen in chronic urticaria. HCPLive: Can you highlight any other efficacy findings? Soong: The proportion of patients that reached a hive score of 0 and an itch score of 0 at 12 weeks was 50 percent and 53 percent, respectively. HCPLive: What did the trial reveal about povorcitinib’s safety and tolerability? Soong: We tested 3 doses of [povorcitinib]. The 15 mg, the 45 mg, and the 75 mg were all well-tolerated with no safety signals observed. The most common effects were acne, headaches, and nasopharyngitis. There were 3 severe adverse events that were only in the placebo arm, and then 2 patients receiving the 45 mg discontinued due to tinnitus and subcutaneous abscess, while 2 patients receiving povorcitinib at 75 mg discontinued due to an increase in serum ferritin and acne. HCPLive: What's next for povorcitinib research moving forward? Soong: What this study showed is that…JAK inhibitors are a potential treatment therapy for chronic spontaneous urticaria. Currently, the program for povorcitinib with chronic spontaneous urticaria is on hold due to priorities of the company.

"Amazon Haul launches in Canada with fashion, electronics, home and beauty items as low as $1","Amazon has launched an ultra-low-priced marketplace in Canada that promises hundreds of thousands of items for $25 or less, with the majority under $10, and some as low as $1. Amazon Haul, now available in Canada using the Amazon Shopping mobile app, it is expected to compete with platforms like AliExpress, Shein and Wish, which offer a variety of low-priced goods. In a news release, Amazon said its new Amazon Haul feature offers Canadians multiple merchandise categories, including fashion, home, beauty and electronics. Canadian customers can receive five per cent off orders over $70 and 10 per cent off orders over $100, with free shipping on orders over $35. A standard delivery fee of $6.99 applies to orders of less than $35. Amazon Haul is designed to offer a fun, engaging way to shop on the app, the company said. It promises to deliver orders in two weeks or less. “Delighting customers through innovation has been Amazon’s approach from day one, and we’re always adapting to what matters most to them,” said Eva Lorenz, Amazon Canada vice-president and country manager in a release. Lorenz added the new offering reflects Amazon’s commitment to convenience and a trustworthy experience, with expanded affordable options. Amazon Haul has launched in Canada, with hundreds of thousands of items under $25 and some as low as $1. A spokesperson said via email Amazon Haul is available exclusively on mobile devices for select customers in Canada. Customers can browse product selection and prices by visiting amazon.ca/haul from their mobile phone. Using the Amazon Shopping app, search “Haul” in the search bar and navigate to Amazon Haul from the main menu icon. Amazon said its Amazon Haul feature will be rolled out to all Canadian customers over the next few weeks. On social media, commenters have described Amazon Haul as an online dollar store. On the r/amazonprime subreddit at reddit.com, commenters have described some of the bargains they’ve scored on the platform. “I got some pretty looking golden pearl shower curtain hangers and a ridiculously silly cat poster that actually showed up on very cheap canvas as opposed to a poster. So actually much better quality than expected,” commenter Few_Theory1979 wrote earlier this month. Reddit commenter I_Heart_Gatos said they use Amazon Haul at least twice a month with mostly good luck. For clothing, the commenter said customers should be careful with sizing. A large-sized clothing item may more comparable to a U.S.-size small, for example. “However, their sizing does work for me when it comes to socks,” the commenter noted. “I usually need smaller socks (4-8, not 5-9) and they have them.” I_Heart_Gatos noted they have also ordered plastic organizing bins and containers, kitchen items and some hard-to-find cellphone cases. The Amazon Haul user said shoppers can also find silly items like humorous signs and plaques. The commenter said they will not order electronics due to fire hazard concerns and also avoids buying makeup. Amazon said customers can use customer reviews and star ratings to select products. Amazon said it checks all products on Amazon Haul to ensure customers receive products that are safe and compliant with applicable regulations and Amazon policies. Amazon Haul also offers free returns within 15 days. “In many cases, customers don’t have to worry about boxes or labels, and their preferred drop-off location will handle the packing, labelling, and shipping,” Amazon said.

"Shohei Ohtani, Aaron Judge are baseball’s historic most valuable players","As a gripping postseason made clear in recent weeks, this is a lustrous baseball era, one molded by titans and enjoyed across oceans. Thursday night’s crowning of Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees as this year’s National League and American League most valuable players offered a reminder of its rarity. One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice. He was a unanimous choice by Baseball Writers’ Association of America voters. Ohtani’s achievements remain impossible to overstate. He is a legend in his prime, who has won World Series titles in both years he played with a team that matched his effort. His 172 wRC+ - a measurement of how many runs a player creates per plate appearance adjusted to allow comparison across stadiums and eras - was second only to Judge among all major leaguers. None of the other top hitters also made 14 regular season pitching starts with a 2.87 ERA. If he threw enough innings to qualify - and as he eased his way back from elbow surgery, he fell well short - Ohtani would have tied for third among starters with 11.87 strikeouts per nine innings, more than AL and NL Cy Young Award winners Tarik Skubal of the Detroit Tigers and Paul Skenes of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who received those honors Wednesday. Ohtani’s FIP, fielding independent pitching, was 1.90 - almost half a run better than Skenes and Skubal. Much like Ohtani, Judge has felt nearly untouchable in this race in recent years when healthy. He entered this season having won two of the past three AL MVPs, disrupted only when Ohtani won for the Los Angeles Angels in 2023. And he finished this season with massive numbers, most notably a .331 batting average that was 20 points higher than anyone else in baseball, and paired that with 53 home runs. His 204 wRC+ is the 10th-best single-season mark since 1975, trailing four Bonds seasons and two of his own, among others. And yet, despite one of his best all-around offensive seasons, Judge was no lock for this year’s award because Raleigh also compiled a season for the ages. After some offseason adjustments, the switch-hitting catcher started hitting home runs and never stopped, setting the regular season record for home runs by a catcher and threatening Judge’s AL mark with 60 regular season homers. Raleigh did this while managing one of the game’s best pitching staffs, playing in 159 games and catching 121 of them. In an age when the rigors of catching and preparing to steer a handful of pitchers through endless data and scouting reports each night have made true offensive stars rare at the position, Raleigh somehow withstood the workload to lead the Mariners through a storybook season that yielded their first AL West title since 2001 and ended one win shy of the World Series. He also set a new single-season record for home runs by a switch hitter, another aspect of his skill set that requires extra preparation. Voters from the BBWAA, therefore, debated the merits of Judge’s astounding offensive season against Raleigh’s ability to hit for record power while also handling the sport’s most demanding everyday position. The result was one of the more dramatic votes in recent memory. Quality local journalism needs your support Access this story and all of our stories with 24/7 unlimited access. Subscribe today.

Dollar rises against euro amid Fed rate cut speculation,"By Karen Brettell NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar gained on the euro and was roughly flat against the yen on Friday as stocks recovered from a sharp selloff and traders weighed whether the Federal Reserve is likely to cut rates in December. A flood of data that was delayed during the federal government shutdown is pending release starting next week. Risk sentiment has been dented by concerns about lofty stock valuations and Fed policy, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite stock indexes rebounded on Friday. The greenback had weakened on Thursday even as stocks dropped and Treasury yields climbed. More Fed officials have signalled caution over further easing, citing worries about inflation. Fed funds futures are pricing in only a 41% chance of a 25-basis-point cut in December. RETURN OF DATA SEEN BOOSTING VOLATILITY Markets are ""disjointed because of the lack of data and the people reacting to the Fed speakers,"" said Lou Brien, strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. The return of U.S. data is likely to increase market volatility, which has ebbed in recent weeks in its absence. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Friday it was working to update its schedule of economic data releases affected by the recently ended government shutdown. Bank of America foreign exchange strategists Adarsh Sinha and Claudio Piron note that volatility has also declined as interest rate differential volatility reached fresh lows, which was driven by some central banks, including the European Central Bank, approaching the end of their easing cycles. Now, ""we expect rate differential (and therefore FX) volatility to rise as US data releases resume, not to mention the considerable uncertainty around the rate paths of the (Bank of England) and (Bank of Japan),"" they said. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.07% to 99.31, with the euro down 0.12% at $1.1617. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar weakened 0.02% to 154.52. The pound tumbled against both the dollar and the euro after media reports, including from Reuters, that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Finance Minister Rachel Reeves have abandoned plans to raise income tax rates, marking a sharp shift just weeks ahead of the November 26 budget. The British currency was last down 0.24% at $1.3158. The euro hit its highest rate to the pound since April 2023. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar strengthened 0.15% to 0.794. It earlier weakened to a one-month low of 0.7876 as traders rushed into the safe haven Swiss currency. The Swiss government also said on Friday that the United States will slash its tariffs on goods from Switzerland to 15% from a crippling 39% under a new framework trade agreement. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell 3.41% to $95,433, the lowest since May.

Bulgaria names manager to take over Russia's Lukoil refinery after US sanctions,"A parliamentary vote authorised the government to seize Lukoil's assets in the country Bulgaria on Friday nominated a senior government official to take control of a major Lukoil refinery in the east of the country following US sanctions against the Russian oil giant. The United States last month hit Russia's two biggest oil producers -- Rosneft and Lukoil -- with sanctions over its war in Ukraine. Lukoil has owned the Neftochim plant -- the largest oil refinery in the Balkans -- in the Black Sea city of Burgas since 1999. A week ago, a parliamentary vote authorised the government to seize Lukoil's assets in Bulgaria, where it enjoys a quasi-monopoly with a network of oil depots, petrol stations, as well as firms supplying ships and aircraft. The cabinet appointed National Revenue Agency director Rumen Spetsov as special administrator of the assets, economy minister Petar Dilov said. ""Rumen Spetsov, whom I have nominated, meets all legal requirements,"" Dilov told a press conference after a cabinet meeting. He said that Spetsov, a former bodybuilding champion , would ""ensure effective and lawful control over the body operating the critical infrastructure"". The US sanctions, which will come into force on November 21, have raised concerns among Bulgarian leaders that they could lead to the shutdown of the crucial refinery. The measures taken ensure that ""in the shortest possible time"", OFAC (the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control) could issue a license that allows the refinery to operate after November 21, Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov said on Friday. On the same day, the US Treasury Department issued a license authorizing transactions involving certain Lukoil entities in Bulgaria -- including Lukoil Neftohim Burgas JSC -- until April 29 next year. The US Treasury also issued a license for some transactions involving Lukoil retail service stations outside Russia and contracts for the sale of its international assets, until December 13. The emergency law on the Lukoil assets allows the special administrator -- whose actions cannot be challenged in court -- to sell shares to a new owner, pending government approval. This has drawn criticism from Bulgarian President Rumen Radev -- whose veto on the legislation was overruled by parliament -- and opposition lawmakers. Radev said the parliamentary vote undermined ""the rule of law"" and posed ""an unreasonably high risk to public finances"" as Lukoil could sue Bulgaria and claim significant compensation. The opposition, comprising pro-Russian and liberal factions, has accused the government of preparing to transfer the refinery to a company close to the ruling coalition, a claim the coalition has firmly denied. Moscow's ambassador to Sofia, Eleonora Mitrofanova, told Russian news agency TASS on Monday that Bulgaria was ""setting a dangerous precedent"", adding it ""looks like a law on property expropriation"". Last month, Bulgarian lawmakers adopted temporary restrictions on exports of petroleum products, including to other European Union members, to ensure sufficient supplies following the US sanctions on Russian energy. rb-bys/sms Originally published on doc.afp.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.

"Dear Abby: Worried mom sees young son struggling to making friends, just like she did","DEAR ABBY: I am a 36-year-old woman from Pakistan. I read your advice with great interest. Since childhood, it was always hard for me to make friends. People who I liked I pushed hard to be friends with, but I guess I came across as too clingy. I’m the one who initiates most contact with my old school friends. Now I see the same thing happening with my 7-year-old son. When his cousins or my cousins’ kids come and he plays with them, he wants to maintain friendships with them through video calls, voice messages, etc. I can see that the other kids and their parents aren’t as interested in maintaining friendships, including my brother and his daughter. My son is sensitive like I was. How do I explain to him that he shouldn’t expect everyone to be his friend without giving him the impression that “nobody cares”? -- SAD MOM IN PAKISTAN DEAR SAD MOM: Friendships have to evolve naturally. Often this happens through shared interests. What is your son interested in? Is he involved in sports or other activities outside of school? While it is true that no one can “expect” others to be close friends, relationships form as a result of exposure to a variety of activities and individuals. Your fear that your son will turn out to have the same social difficulties that you do may be groundless. He may need exposure to more kids than he has had in order to find his way socially.

"Asking Eric: I understand companies want employees to ‘be friendlier,’ but I find it intrusive","Dear Eric: Many companies are training their employees to “be friendlier.” Now, when I go to pay for my groceries or have bloodwork done at a lab, someone invariably asks me, “so what are you doing the rest of your day?” I find that to be very intrusive from someone I don’t know and may never see again. I understand they have been trained so it isn’t necessarily their fault, but I need a better response than “who wants to know?” or “why are you asking me this?” – Trying to Keep Boundaries Dear Boundaries: Something general and meaningless can help divert small talk such as this. “Oh, not sure” or “enjoying it, I hope” or “this and that.” These are empty calorie phrases that keep the ball in the air without forcing you to divulge anything you don’t want to divulge. It’s also helpful to keep the context of these questions in mind. These people aren’t prying. As you said, they’re trained to make small talk so that customers feel comfortable. Depersonalizing the ask can help. When someone asks, “what are you doing for the rest of the day?” remind yourself that this is not actually a question designed for you. They’re talking to you, but they’re not actually talking to you, if that makes sense. It’s also fine to assert your internal boundary in a friendly but direct way. “Thanks for asking, but I’m not much of a chatter. I hope you’re having a good day, though.” Dear Eric: My closest friend of many years has recently revealed the sad news that she has terminal cancer. She is one of those rare humans that most people have an instant connection to, and then they become fast friends. In addition to being close friends, we were colleagues who often worked closely together, traveled together and shared many common friends, work friends, vendors and clients. Several decades worth of projects and likely in the hundreds of people within that group. There is a very small group (less than five people) of us who she has shared the news with. She has expressed her preference to not share details with our greater community until she can get her bearings with diagnosis and treatment, however, she will eventually want us to tell friends her story and status updates. Our small group is aligned on supporting her in any way and her wishes; she does not have a significant other or family to help her shoulder the burden. What are the words to inevitably use when I share the information to our work community knowing they’re more than just colleagues? How do I grieve with others as they learn her prognosis and safeguard my own emotional state as I share her story? I don’t know how to navigate this all without breaking down anytime I think about it or talk about her situation. – Grieving Best Friend Dear Best Friend: I’m sorry for what your friend is going through, and what you’re facing as well. This is hard. And it’s fine if you have the capacity to hold your friend through it but not enough left over to help others process. With regard to the words, you’re going to want to take your cue from your friend in terms of how much she wants shared. When she indicates she’s ready for the larger community to know, ask her about her boundaries, her wishes for communication and what places feel too exposed. Sometimes, something brief, compassionate, and direct can give people the information they need and guidance about how to respond. Here’s one potential: “I want to share some very hard news about our colleague and friend. She’s received a diagnosis of [diagnosis]. [Here you might add a sentence about her prognosis or how she’s doing, depending on your friend’s wishes.] As you can imagine, this is an overwhelming time. Instead of calls or emails, our friend is asking that any communication about updates go through [either list a designated updater or a health update site like CaringBridge.org]” Resist the urge to preemptively memorialize in this message; instead, you can share your grief, your fears and your memories with the small group and with others in your personal circle that you trust. To protect yourself, I encourage you to look into one of the update sites, rather than directing people to reach out to one of you about what’s going on. It’s in our nature as people to slide from questions to processing. These sites provide a buffer that will give you the needed space to safeguard your emotions. Others may want to know more or to offer sympathies, but the most important thing right now is that the people closest to your friend, you included, have the capacity to fully show up for your friend.

"Fact-check: Disturbing child abuse clip originated in Iraq, not Pakistan","The incident was reported by Iraqi media, which stated that the father had been arrested by the police Updated Saturday Nov 15 2025 Trigger Warning: Violence against a child The following fact check discusses a video containing distressing footage of a young child being physically assaulted. Reader discretion is advised. A viral video shows a man brutally beating a young child with a plastic hose. Social media users claim the incident occurred in Pakistan and have called on authorities to intervene. The claim is false. The video was not filmed in Pakistan. On November 4, a Facebook user shared a six-second video with a caption in Urdu reading: “Please share this clip as widely as possible so that this man is punished for what he did. Should a teacher behave like this?” The clip shows a man hitting a young girl, who is cornered and crying in pain. At the time of writing, the video had been viewed over 9,000 times on Facebook. The claims also took off on X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook and Instagram here, here and here. The video is from Iraq, not Pakistan, and shows a father violently beating his daughter. Geo Fact Check conducted a reverse image search of key frames from the video and traced the earliest upload to an account that posted it on October 30, identifying the man as being from Baghdad, Iraq. The incident was also reported by Iraqi media outlets 964 Media and Hatha Alyoum English, both of which stated on October 30 that the father had been arrested by Rusafa police.

Public advised against touching red seaweed in Kuala Nerus,"KUALA NERUS: The public is advised not to touch or handle clumps of red seaweed that have washed ashore on the beaches of Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT). Head of the UMT Reference & Repository Centre (RRC-UMT), Associate Professor Dr Muhammad Hafiz Borkhanuddin, said the advice was issued because physical contact with the species, which belongs to the Ceramiales group, may cause itching among individuals with sensitive skin. He said the appearance of red seaweed is commonly observed ahead of the Northeast Monsoon (MTL) transition, when strong winds, coastal currents and powerful waves dislodge the species from the seabed and push it ashore. ""Recently, we have observed a phenomenon of red seaweed washing up along the UMT beach. The seaweed is light red, thread-like with short segments, soft and not easily broken. ""It is not toxic, but it is easily damaged when exposed to freshwater such as rain. The risk to humans relates mainly to physical contact on the beach or in the water, and individuals with sensitive skin may experience itching,” he said in a statement on Saturday (Nov 15). Muhammad Hafiz said seaweed has a wide global distribution, occurring in both temperate and tropical regions. He added that similar occurrences of seaweed washing ashore on the UMT coastline were recorded between August and December 2003, as well as in October 2016. ""Seaweed clumps that are not collected will undergo natural degradation. The liquid produced during this process will accumulate beneath the clumps, emitting a foul odour and attracting large numbers of small insects. ""The main risk is the release of toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which can cause dizziness and nausea. Therefore, the public is advised to avoid any activities in areas where red seaweed has washed up,” he said. However, Muhammad Hafiz said that the phenomenon is not a sign of pollution, but rather a natural process within the coastal ecosystem, where seaweed serves as a temporary habitat for small marine organisms such as amphipods, isopods and coastal insects. — Bernama Thank you for your report!",2025-11-15 08:04:00,The Star,neutral,0.5145,15,Nhk_Targeted_At," The public is advised not to touch or handle clumps of red seaweed that have washed ashore on the beaches of Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT) Head of the UMT Reference & Repository Centre (RRC-UMT), Associate Professor Dr Muhammad Hafiz Borkhanuddin, said the advice was issued because physical contact with the species may cause itching among individuals with sensitive skin ."
Tigers tear through Grizzlies in state semis,"MOSCOW — Top seed and defending-champion Kendrick lived up to its billing and then some in Idaho Class 2A state football playoff semifinal action on Friday at the P1FCU Kibbie Dome. Facing south Idaho’s top 2A team, the fourth-seeded Grace Grizzlies, the undefeated Tigers produced a rout of proportions seldom seen in the latter stages of the postseason to prevail 82-6. “They played lights out,” Kendrick coach Ty Koepp said of his Tigers. “They worked really hard all week, had our best week in practice going into this. I’m just proud of the boys; now it’s on to the next week and getting ready.” Kendrick’s starters scored on every one of their possessions and three of Grace’s (a safety and two interception returns) en route to building a 76-0 lead before heading to the bench midway through the third quarter. The Grizzlies proved evenly matched with the Tigers’ second-stringers from there on out. Kendrick’s last remaining obstacle to a fifth consecutive state title (and second straight since moving up to Class 2A) now lies in the third-seeded Logos Knights of Moscow, who avenged themselves in style on the second-seeded Kamiah Kubs in the day’s other semifinal. The Tigers and Knights will return to the Kibbie Dome for a title game on Friday of next week. Resistance is futile There was a sense for much of the first quarter that Grace (9-2), which had finished the regular season ranked second in Idaho Class 2A state media polling and received its fourth seed based on MaxPreps computer rankings, might be able to offer some resistance. The Tigers (11-0) quickly whisked the ball down the field and scored each time they had possession, but the Grizzlies proved stubborn and reliable enough to manage a series of prolonged drives inching their way forward with apparent hope of scoring. Grace’s second drive, with Kendrick leading 16-0 late in the first quarter, came all the way to the brink of the Tigers’ end zone, but a pair of tackles by defensive back Cade Silflow and a sack by lineman Travis Hix thwarted their ambitions and led to a turnover on downs. Kendrick’s Tanner Clemenhagen then promptly blazed to a 65-yard rushing touchdown, weaving between Grace defenders to establish a 22-0 lead that reinforced the sense that the rout was on. The floodgates were wide open in the second quarter, which began with Kendrick’s junior lineman Keegan Anderson inflicting a safety on Grace — an accurate signal that the Grizzlies’ glimmers of offensive success had faded. The score swelled to 56-0 by halftime, and the Tiger starters reeled off another 20 points over the first few minutes of the third quarter for good measure before the second string took over. Grace finally got on the board with just under a minute remaining in the third quarter, while Kendrick’s relief quarterback Hank Heimgartner connected with Hudson Kirkland for a fourth-quarter 73-yard passing play to log the final points of the evening. Stats of note Kendrick quarterback Maddox Kirkland had a customarily dominant night, following up on an opening-drive rushing touchdown with a 9-for-14 passing performance for 276 yards and four more TDs. “I just had to get the ball out to my players, and they made plays happen and made me look good,” Kirkland said. Cade Silflow was Kirkland’s most prolific receiver, catching five passes for 160 yards and three touchdowns. On the ground, Ralli Roetcisoender was highly efficient, using three rushes to amass 49 yards and two touchdowns before adding an interception-return score to boot. Fans in force The always-lively Kendrick fan community turned out in force for this game. Thomas Duggan, one of a group of young boys who sat at the front of the stands passing around and waving an enlarged cardboard cutout of wide receiver Nathan Tweit’s head, could be heard shouting “Yeah Nathan!” as Tweit caught a midfield pass from Kirkland and tore to the end zone for an early second-quarter touchdown. Paul Hutcheson, a 67-year-old lifelong Kendrick resident and longtime visible presence at Tiger sporting events, continued a personal tradition when he stood up at the end of the third quarter to lead a chant of “Give me a T! Give me an I” and so forth. Looking ahead Logos (9-2) is the only team to have bested Kendrick in the last four years, inflicting a 30-18 regular-season league defeat on the Tigers last year before Kendrick struck back in a 52-26 state semifinal. A 48-24 league victory against the Knights was by far the Tigers’ most competitive game so far this season, in which they trailed 16-14 at halftime and nosed ahead 20-16 through three quarters before an offensive explosion in the fourth turned it into a runaway. “They’re a great football team,” Koepp said of Logos. “They work really hard as well; they’re very well coached; so it’ll be a great game.” Grace 0 0 6 0— 6 Kendrick 22 34 20 6—82 FIRST QUARTER Kendrick — Maddox Kirkland 1 run (Ralli Roetcisoender run).

Former Buckingham Palace worker reveals one person that can say 'no' to King Charles,"Former Royal butler Paul Burrell has revealed there is only one person who can refuse King Charles as he offered his insights on the current Royal Family dynamics. In his book The Royal Insider: My Life with the Queen, the King and Princess Diana, Paul, 67, identified the sole individual capable of declining the monarch as his spouse of two decades, Queen Camilla. Paul characterized the Queen as a ""non-negotiable"" figure who seldom requests much, yet receives everything. He stated: ""Charles has always lived in a world where all his household and staff bow and call him 'your Royal Highness'. Now, of course, it is 'Your Majesty'. Nobody says no. If you do, you're out."", reports The Mirror. ""He lives in a gilded bubble and is served whatever he wants, whenever he wants and by whom he wants. The only person that can say 'no' is Camilla. She is and always will be a non-negotiable. Perhaps her no-nonsense approach is what Charles needs. ""She's the steady hand on the tiller of the royal ship now, like it or not. She is at the helm. She rarely asks for anything but is given everything and now has the ultimate position as queen."" Beyond identifying the singular person who can deny the 76 year old monarch, Paul also asserted that Charles' daily routines have remained largely unchanged through the years. He penned: ""His routines have never changed. His toothpaste is squeezed onto his toothbrush every morning and he uses a silver key which winds down the tube to avoid any waste. ""His pyjamas are laundered or pressed every day, the drawstring tapes pressed flat like his shoelaces. He, again like his father, likes his dress shoes to be 'spit-and-polished' to a mirror finish."" While Paul remarked on Charles' longstanding daily rituals, another former butler weighed in on how the King might have reacted to a military-themed social media post shared by Prince Harry's wife, Meghan Markle, earlier this week. Meghan posted the video to honor Veterans Day, America's version of Remembrance Day, celebrating the contributions of her husband and all military personnel. Regarding what Charles may have made of the post, former Royal butler Grant Harrold told ReachPlc that he suspects the King would have embraced it. You agree you are 18 or over.

I don't think the Royal Family will feel badly about it at all; I think they will approve it. ""She's marking Veterans Day-which is America's version of Remembrance Day-and showing her pride in the active service her husband undertook. ""The King was extremely proud of his son serving in Afghanistan, and he will be glad at Meghan acknowledging and respecting this.""",2025-11-15 08:04:00,Daily Express Us,neutral,0.7362,5,Estate_Million_To," Former Royal butler Paul Burrell has revealed there is only one person who can refuse King Charles .

Maithili Thakur’s Indian Idol Video Goes Viral After Her Alinagar MLA Victory — Watch,"Maithili Thakur’s old Indian Idol video has gone viral again following her victory as the new Alinagar MLA. Fans are revisiting her musical journey, celebrating how the former teenage singer has now risen to become one of Bihar’s youngest legislators. Trending Photos Maithili Thakur, the 25-year-old singer who first rose to fame through TV music shows, is now making a strong mark in Bihar’s political landscape. Contesting from the Alinagar seat, she has taken a significant lead of 84,915 votes over RJD candidate Binod Mishra, positioning herself for a landmark victory. Maithili is poised to become the youngest MLA in the Bihar Assembly. Her rise is remarkable—transitioning from a popular teenage performer to a prominent BJP figure in a constituency where the party has never won before. She turned 25 in July, and her entry into an assembly where the average candidate age is around 51 highlights the generational shift she represents. The last time Bihar saw such a young winner was in 2005, when independent candidate Tauseef Alam was elected at 26, followed later by RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, also at 26. Maithili’s popularity is not new. Her old Indian Idol audition video recently went viral again, reminding the internet of her powerful voice and humble beginnings on national television. This resurgence of her musical clips further boosted interest in her political journey, drawing attention to how far she has come since her teenage years.

She is the BJP Candidate from Alinagar Seat. #MaithiliThakur pic.twitter.com/9ouaBwba1k (@Polytikles) November 14, 2025 Her election campaign stood out for its strong family involvement. Her younger brothers—Rishav, a tabla player, and Ayachi, the youngest—accompanied her throughout the campaign, performing folk music at rallies to emphasise her cultural roots. Their presence helped reinforce her identity in Mithila, a region known for its artistic heritage. Supporting them were her maternal uncles, Nand Kishore Jha and Sumit Jha, who handled coordination and ground operations across Alinagar. The Thakur siblings have long been social-media favourites, especially for their soulful performances featuring Ramcharitmanas recitations, which have garnered millions of views online. Over the years, Maithili has been recognised with several honours, including the Atal Mithila Samman and the Lokmat Sur Jyotsna National Music Award. In 2019, she and her brothers were appointed brand ambassadors for Madhubani by the Election Commission. Her shift from cultural icon to political newcomer reflects a strategic move by the BJP to expand its appeal in regions traditionally seen as difficult terrain. Should the counting end in her favour, Maithili Thakur’s victory will stand out as one of the most compelling narratives of this Bihar election—an artist gracefully stepping into politics while carrying forward both tradition and ambition.

"Positive trends show tariff reforms, FBR modernization bearing fruits: PM","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif Saturday said that the positive trends due to tariff reforms and the government’s steps to modernize and improve the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) transparently were solid evidence of the correctness of the measures. He was chairing the weekly review meeting on reforms in the country’s tax system. “The latest economic statistics are proving the government’s economic reforms are working, as a result of which the pace of economic growth is improving every day, evidence of which is also coming before the business community and the nation,” he added. During the meeting, it was briefed that the tariff reforms carried out this year have not had any negative impact on revenue collection, rather, the collection of duties and taxes at the import level has increased by 25 percent. وزیراعظم محمد شہباز شریف کی زیر صدارت ملکی ٹیکس نظام میں اصلاحات پر ہفتہ وار جائزہ اجلاس وزیراعظم نے ٹیکس چوری روکنے، تمباکو، ٹائلز اور دیگر بڑے شعبوں میں ٹیکس وصولی کے نظام میں موجود خامیوں کو مرحلہ وار موثر انداز میں ختم کرنے کے لیے انتظامی اور اداراجاتی اقدامات اٹھانے کی… pic.twitter.com/KlHEg02ANw — Government of Pakistan (@GovtofPakistan) November 15, 2025 This increase came despite a mere 3.6% increase in the volume of dutiable products, which also disproved fears that reducing tariffs would reduce revenue collection. The participants were told that duty-free imports increased by 41.5%, which means that a large increase in imports has occurred in products that fall under the category of raw materials and intermediate goods. This can be considered a sign of significant improvement in the impact on productivity at the basic level. The meeting was told that the ongoing economic reforms, including tariff reduction and improvement of the tax system were aimed at increasing manufacturing and exports, thereby making the environment more conducive for investment in the country. Islamabad: Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif chairs weekly progress review meeting on FBR reforms. pic.twitter.com/a3L0NLdjs5 — Government of Pakistan (@GovtofPakistan) November 15, 2025 The increase in imports of goods falling under the category of duty-free imports is a sign of the effectiveness of the government’s tariff rationalization measures, which are aimed at increasing the import of raw materials and secondary goods. It was informed that the aim of tariff reforms was to reduce the cost of raw materials used in the manufacturing sector so that the volume of domestic exports could increase and competitiveness in the global market could be achieved. Latest data proves that this policy of the government has been successful. The results achieved from customs reforms also include the effects of the successful government strategy of making the FBR a modern, transparent and viable institution. The prime minister directed to take administrative and institutional measures to prevent tax evasion and eliminate the shortcomings in the tax collection system in tobacco, tiles and other major sectors in a phased and effective manner. He congratulated the entire finance team including the FBR and stressed that the pace of effective implementation of the reform process should be further accelerated so that Pakistan can get out of the vortex of economic difficulties and be able to truly meet the sustainable development goals. Federal Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb, Federal Minister for Climate Change Dr. Musadik Malik, Federal Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik, Minister of State for Finance Azhar Bilal Kayani, chief secretaries of all provinces, Chairman FBR and other relevant government officials attended the meeting.

"USC football vs Iowa -- live updates, analysis for Week 12 showdown","The USC Trojans faced the Iowa Hawkeyes, trying to keep their College Football Playoff hopes alive. USC was focused on staying alive for another week and making next week's trip to Oregon matter. USC desperately wanted to fly to Eugene and make sure it faced the Ducks for high stakes. Mission accomplished. It would have been a huge letdown for USC football and Lincoln Riley to travel to the Pacific Northwest with all their dreams dashed and nothing to play for other than pride. By beating Iowa, USC managed to make that game a main event. It marks a positive progression from last season, when the Trojans were playing out the string at this time. USC playing for something big in late November -- even if it doesn't achieve what it ultimately wants -- represents a forward-moving development for the football program going into 2026. Here's how USC's second-half comeback against Iowa unfolded in a wet LA Coliseum: Wow! This team, so soft and so substandard in the first half, showed an enormous amount of guts and toughness in the second half. USC outscored Iowa 19-0 after falling behind 21-7, and shut out the Hawkeyes in the second half. The defense still needs a lot of work, but the team grew in a moment of crisis instead of shriveling. Now the Oregon game matters. Now Lincoln Riley can credibly say his team is learning how to win. There's a lot to discuss, and we will certainly keep the conversation going over the weekend here. Lincoln Riley throws the ball on second down, going for the win instead of just trying to drain Iowa's timeouts. Jayden Maiava throws a strike and this one is just about over. Iowa had a man open on 4th and 6 but he couldn't get his foot down in the USC red zone. The Trojans take over and are close to getting this thing done. Iowa and Gronowski continue to miss throws. USC continues to get stops. Now the Trojans get the ball back with a chance to put this game away. The Trojans lead with just over 13 minutes left. USC has been a great second-half team in recent weeks after playing below-average first halves. Now the Trojans have to finish the job. Will Iowa be able to run the ball despite trailing? That seems to be the big key in the final quarter. The Trojans are inside the Iowa 10 as the quarter ends. This game has undergone a complete 180. Makai Lemon is the difference, but Iowa's passing game has also made crucial errors to hand-deliver the Trojans a golden opportunity to steal this game. Mark Gronowski is not a good passer, but you wouldn't have known it from the way he carved up USC early on. Now, however, his limitations are showing up. He missed an easy throw on Iowa's latest possession and then waited far too long to hit a receiver. The ball was deflected and picked off. USC is on the verge of taking the lead with the ball near the Iowa 40. The 2-point try fails, but USC is definitely back in the game after an 82-yard touchdown drive with Makai Lemon dominating. He's making high-level catches and is in God mode right now. This is the best we've seen from Lemon all season. This is what a Biletnikoff Award winner looks like. It's pretty simple: Keep Iowa out of the end zone, win the game. Iowa probably isn't winning this game with only 24 points. A good drive bogs down because of a penalty. The Trojans settle for three and now have to play some defense to really get back in this game. This is just a poorly-coached team which keeps doing the same bad things without course corrections or improvements. It's not the USC standard. If this team doesn't rally in 30 minutes, the season is essentially over. Stop if you've heard this before: A big USC play is wiped out by an illegal man downfield penalty on a lineman. It's the third time that has happened this season. The Trojan defense is soft and is getting dragged around the Coliseum. This is just a horror show. I thought Halloween was over. A brilliant drive from Jayden Maiava. He converts a short-yardage situation with a keeper -- the kind of play USC fans have been clamoring for -- and then eludes a pass rusher to make a downfield throw near the sideline to set up a touchdown. USC needed 20 minutes to wake up, but at least the Trojans are here. They're back in it. Just completely unacceptable on every level. The Hawkeyes are about to make it 14-0. USC is getting punched in the mouth. What was this coaching staff doing all week? USC hasn't shown any indication that it was prepared for Iowa. USC goes for it on 4th and 1 near midfield. The play gets blown up. It wasn't even close. Iowa far more physical in the first quarter, much like Nebraska. This is pathetic. USC failed to cover a simple out route on 3rd and 8, but Iowa quarterback Mark Gronowski badly misfired, forcing the Hawkeyes to punt. USC is asleep at the wheel and is lucky to be down only seven. Ja'Kobi Lane drops a pass which would have produced a first down. USC is back to its bad habits again. This team cannot manage to start a game playing well. It is rare these days. Michigan was the exception, not the rule. USC didn't cover anyone. It didn't get a pass rush. It allowed a bunch of big pass plays to Iowa. Other than that, great start.

Iran Confirms Seizure Of Tanker In Gulf,"A South Korean-flagged tanker vessel which was seized by Iran. is seen in Gulf, Iran January 4, 2021. IRGC / WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS DUBAI, Nov 15 (Reuters) – Iran confirmed on Saturday that its Revolutionary Guards had seized a tanker in Gulf waters carrying a cargo of petrochemicals bound for Singapore over alleged violations, Iranian state media reported. A U.S. official and maritime security sources had said on Friday that Iranian forces intercepted the oil products tanker and diverted it into Iranian territorial waters. It was the first report of Tehran seizing a tanker since Israeli-U.S. strikes on Iran in June. Iranian state-run television read a statement from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) stating that “the tanker was in violation for carrying unauthorized cargo.” It did not provide further details of the alleged violations. The Marshall Islands-flagged tanker, the Talara, had been sailing off the United Arab Emirates’ coast, maritime sources said, and was carrying a cargo of high-sulfur gasoil through the Indian Ocean en route to Singapore from Sharjah in the UAE. The vessel’s manager Columbia Shipmanagement said it lost contact with the Talara Friday morning around 20 nautical miles off the coast of Khor Fakkan, UAE. It added that it was working closely with relevant parties, including maritime security agencies and the vessel’s owner, to restore contact. The ship is owned by Cyprus-based Pasha Finance. In a statement, the U.S. military said it was aware of the incident and was actively monitoring the situation. Iran’s IRGC has periodically seized commercial vessels in Gulf waters in recent years, often citing maritime violations such as alleged smuggling, technical infractions or legal disputes. However, the U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the incident was surprising since Iran had not carried out any such operations in recent months. Iran has curbed its military activities in the region since the 12-day Israeli bombing campaign in June, which was joined by the United States. Its last reported seizure of a vessel was in April 2024. (Editing by Louise Heavens and Joe Bavier) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

""She needs to face the consequences for what she did.""

Federal judge finds ICE's license plate checks led to unlawful arrest in Beaverton case,"Now 68° Sun 85° Mon 85° by Jennifer Singh A view of the Federal Courthouse after a protest on March 11, 2021 (KATU Photo) PORTLAND, Ore. (KATU) — A federal judge has ruled the recent detainment of a 24-year-old Guatemalan man in Beaverton unlawful after ICE randomly ran drivers’ plates to check their immigration status. According to court documents, on November 8, ICE officers ran the license plate of the defendant, named as J.Y.L.C., and he was pulled over due to the vehicle registration having a different address than ICE had on file. Respondents of the case said at the time, they were “randomly running the license plates of vehicles traveling around them and the names and dates of birth of the registered wonders of those vehicles through DHS systems to determine if the registered owner was in the United States unlawfully.” RELATED: Congressional push to sever ICE's DMV data access gains traction in Democratic-led states They went on to say “[v]ehicles were chosen at random and were not targeted based on any characteristics of the driver or the vehicle.” Court documents show the officers generated a warrant on the spot for the defendant’s arrest before pulling him over, saying failure to update his address “rendered him a flight risk.” Additionally, according to his lawyer, Nicholas Costa, federal agents told J.Y.L.C. he had a deportation order as well. J.Y.L.C. also admitted to driving without a license. He was arrested immediately and was ultimately transported to the ICE facility in Tacoma. Court documents show ICE detained the man under Section 235(b)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which requires immediate detention for incoming immigrants until they can be formally removed. However, U.S. District Judge Amy Baggio determined that law does not apply to the defendant, who has been living in Oregon for eight years. Costa, tells KATU that J.Y.L.C is under “legal presence” in Oregon. According to Costa, he entered the United States in 2017 when he was 16 years old and has lived in Oregon since then. Documents also show he filed for asylum in 2019, with a hearing set for next month. Costa also said his client lives in Beaverton, works a full-time job in construction, and is the sole caregiver for his partner and his 13-month old child. ""He's got a social security number, he files his taxes, pays his bills, takes care of his kids,"" Costa said. ""So, he's doing everything right."" Costa said when he received the call that his client was detained, he immediately filed a habeas petition and a temporary restraining order in federal district court. ""To get this thing filed, we had nine minutes before they transferred my client from Oregon to Washington where the detention facility is, and had I not filed that within that small window of time, the judge wouldn't have had jurisdiction and wouldn't have been able to file the orders that she did,"" Costa said. According to Costa, J.Y.L.C. had moved just around the corner from his original address, but had forgotten to update records, the reason for the address discrepancy. ""He had no reason to lie,"" Costa said. "" He truly believed that he had done nothing wrong. In fact, it was a little outrageous that the ICE attorney claimed that he had a removal order, and that was actually presented in the evidence that I submitted yesterday."" Judge Baggio told ICE that J.Y.L.C. must receive a bond hearing by Friday (November 14) or he is to be released. Costa said that bond hearing did happen on Friday, and a bail was set, but not after the facility closed its business hours, meaning the family cannot pay bond until the facility opens back up Monday morning. ""That bond order came after ICE was closed at 3 p.m., and so the family was not able to pay the bond, and so my client is still detained in Tacoma until Monday when the ICE office is opened at 9 a.m.,"" Costa said. ""Now, granted, they're still operating everywhere in Oregon and Beaverton, arresting people over the weekend, so it defies logic that they're not open to receive a bond from my client to release him."" Once J.Y.L.C. is released on bail, a hearing will take place in Portland in December.

"Wallace shines, but Illinois offense stalls in road loss to Oregon State","CORVALLIS, OR. — A tough one on the road. The Illini traveled west for their first game away from Champaign of the season, taking on the Oregon State Beavers Friday night. The road game proved to be too big a challenge for the Illini, with the team coming up just short 64-59. The opening quarter set the tone with fast starts followed by cold spells. Oregon State came out firing from deep, hitting its first two threes, while Illinois answered with back-to-back midrange makes. After that early exchange, neither team could buy a basket. The Beavers went over two minutes without a field goal and turned it over three straight possessions. The second quarter swung completely in the Illini’s favor early. A steal and transition layup from Gretchen Dolan pushed the lead to 22-16, and Illinois looked ready to take control. However, the Beavers’ bench flipped the momentum. Their energy sparked an 11-0 run, holding Illinois scoreless for over five and a half minutes. Only two free throws from freshman guard Destiny Jackson finally broke the drought, and Illinois went into halftime trailing 29-28 after seeing a once six-point lead quickly disappear. Coming out of the break, Illinois found exactly one answer: Berry Wallace. The sophomore forward dominated the third quarter, scoring all but 3 of the Illini’s 14 points in the frame and almost single-handedly keeping Illinois in the game. She opened the half with six straight points, briefly putting Illinois ahead 34-31. Still, offensive help was scarce. Outside of Wallace, no Illini player scored until the final two minutes of the quarter, when Cearah Parchment hit a clutch three to tie the game at 41. Even with Wallace’s heroics, Illinois found itself down 43-41 entering the fourth. Wallace had 14 points and 3 rebounds through three quarters, while senior guard Tiara Bolden continued to rise for the Beavers with 13 points and 5 rebounds. The fourth quarter turned into a trading of big-time shots. Parchment drilled another one of her season-high 4 three-pointers with under two minutes left to cut the Beavers’ lead to three, setting up a tense finish. Yet again, however, Bolden answered. Her step-back three with 45 seconds remaining stretched the Beaver lead to eight and effectively sealed the game. She would finish with 25 points, tying her career high. Wallace kept Illinois alive with a banked-in three in the final seconds, bringing her total to 24 points, but it wasn’t enough. Oregon State closed it out at the line, handing Illinois its first loss of the season, 64-59. Road losses in November rarely define a season, and Illinois showed stretches of strong defense and individual brilliance that can still leave the fans with hope of a win next time out.

Pakistan and Jordan reject any displacement of Palestinians from Gaza,"Jordan’s King Abdullah and Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have reaffirmed their “zero-tolerance” stance on any attempt to push Palestinians out of Gaza, doubling down on a position both leaders say is non-negotiable. Sharif hosted the Jordanian monarch in Islamabad for a two-day state visit, where the Gaza crisis dominated their talks. In a statement, Sharif’s office said, “On the issue of Palestine, both leaders acknowledged the unanimity of views and principled positions taken by Pakistan and Jordan regarding the post-war Gaza; zero-tolerance for any displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.” The two leaders also agreed to step up coordination among the eight Arab-Islamic states engaged in discussions with the United States over a possible ceasefire plan, a framework that includes proposals for a new governing arrangement in Gaza and the reconstruction of the enclave, which Israel has largely destroyed through months of bombardment.",2025-11-15 20:06:37,Middleeasteye Net,neutral,0.562,4,2025_Audit_Proceedings, Jordan's King Abdullah and Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have reaffirmed their “zero-tolerance” stance on any attempt to push Palestinians out of Gaza .

DuPont hangs up his waders,"Joe DuPont didn’t know jobs like his existed when he was an undergraduate at the University of Idaho. He aspired to be a medical doctor or veterinarian. “I had no intentions of being a biologist. I don’t think I knew what one was,” he said. “I thought Fish and Game was game wardens.” On a whim, he applied for a Fish and Game gig at a UI job fair and promptly forgot about it. A few weeks later, he was offered and accepted a job running creel surveys in the Sawtooth Valley. “Over a span of three years, I recognized that I didn’t have a lot of empathy for cats or yappy dogs, so (being a vet) probably wasn’t in my future. If I was going to be a doctor, I wanted to be a surgeon and started thinking, ‘Man, that is a lot of years from now but I’m really liking what I’m doing now.’ ” He headed back to UI for graduate school and later took jobs with Avista and the Idaho Department of Lands before returning to Fish and Game. In 2008, he became the fisheries manager for the Clearwater Region and later this month will retire after 18 years guiding some of the state’s most popular and diverse fisheries. The region is renowned for its salmon and steelhead fishing. The Hells Canyon stretch of the Snake River is home to massive white sturgeon, one of the most iconic species in the Columbia River Basin. Tributaries to the Clearwater River that pour out of the Bitterroot Mountains provide blue ribbon westslope cutthroat trout fishing. Dworshak Reservoir boasts kokanee and record-challenging smallmouth bass, and the region has a series of small lakes, ponds and reservoirs cherished for trout, bass, bluegills and more. DuPont, who grew up near Moscow, had fished for many of those species as a kid and college student. “I never really had any intentions to come back and manage the same water I fished as a kid,” he said. “But it’s cool to be able to think about, ‘Oh yeah, I was doing this as a kid and think about how things have changed.’ ” Communication Early in his stint as the Clearwater fisheries manager, DuPont generated some angst from the public over the fickleness of spring chinook fisheries. People love to fish for the hard-fighting salmon. “They’re here for a short period of time. They’re big and they taste great. So the combination of those three things — when they are here, man, people, they’re as passionate as you can get.” But the runs are often small and seasons can sometimes end abruptly, causing frustration among anglers. “My first two years as a fisheries manager, I was very green and probably didn’t know a lot about what the public wanted and I got a lot of hate mail, more than I do now,” he said. “It got to the point where I was like, ‘All right, I need to understand what they want and I need to keep them informed about why we are doing what we are doing.’ ” He started a weekly spring chinook fishery email and, at the same time, worked with the public to develop a harvest matrix that frames season options like daily bag limits and how many days per week will be open to fishing based on run strength. The newsletter was an instant hit. He got comments like, “This is the best thing Fish and Game ever did” and “It’s about time Fish and Game started communicating with us,” he said. “That is when it really hit me that just, ‘My God, they want this information; this is important to them. They want to be kept in the loop, they want to be part of the process.’ ” The email list grew from about 200 people the first year to about 2,000. In addition, the updates are posted to the Fish and Game website as blog posts. They appear weekly during the spring chinook season, but DuPont also writes about other fisheries such as kokanee fishing at Dworshak Reservoir, steelhead forecasts, and interesting research by him and his colleagues. “I would tell any manager in the future, ‘Hey, when you become a manager, not only are you managing the fish but you’ve got to understand what the public wants and keep them involved and in the loop because they are a huge part of the picture.’ ” The harvest matrix was an attempt to satisfy as many people as possible and to make the department and the commission’s season-setting decisions more transparent. Through public meetings and surveys, DuPont said the department learned that people prefer longer seasons even if it means smaller bag limits or fishing limited to four days per week. “So, we’ve structured our fisheries now to try to extend the seasons as long as we can while still providing good opportunity.” Steelhead overhaul Under his watch and with the help of a workgroup, the state changed the structure of the steelhead fishery on the Clearwater River. For decades, most of the Clearwater was open to catch-and-release steelhead fishing from July 1 to Oct. 14. The harvest season opened on Oct. 15. But complications developed. Fall chinook became more abundant, which threatened to change the more laid-back feel of the catch-and-release season when effort is not as intense. The Oct. 15 start of the season made for good fishing for a week or two. But fishing often slowed by mid November as many of the hatchery steelhead are harvested. DuPont convened a working group made up of anglers from different factions and asked them to hammer out a different structure to the season. “We’ve had other working groups but this was the first time we had a working group that their goal was to develop a proposal for fall chinook and steelhead.” The group came up with a menu of two alternatives. One was pretty similar to the old structure. The second was a pretty radical shakeup. The harvest season would open Sept. 10 and then switch to catch-and-release on Oct. 15 and back to harvest on Nov. 9. The department shared the two alternatives with the public and ultimately recommended the radical shift that was adopted by the commission. It’s proved to be popular with many anglers. The earlier start allows people to harvest A-run fish that visit the Clearwater before leaving for other destinations. They also have a chance to catch and keep early arriving B-run steelhead, fall chinook and coho. The switch to catch-and-release retains the lower-effort steelhead fishing popular with fly anglers and others. It also allows B-run steelhead to pile up and become distributed up and down the river before harvest season reopens, solving the problem of a hot start to the harvest season followed by a crash in catch rates. A new fishing hole When DuPont took the job, Deyo Reservoir near Weippe was nothing more than an idea. It had some momentum but had not progressed much and people were wondering if it would happen. He worked with a group of people from Weippe and they decided to apply for a grant. They got it and matching money. “Now, there’s a beautiful reservoir that will be there for 100 years or more. The campground is full all summer long. To see that kind of project to fruition is pretty amazing,” he said. DuPont names sturgeon as his favorite fish and has made monitoring, managing and researching the Hells Canyon population a key focus during his time in the Clearwater Region. That work includes pioneering novel ways to help the population that is in decline. “Since I’ve been here, we’ve gone through a variety of studies, trying to understand this population to make sure that we’re doing whatever we can to make sure it’s healthy and persistent,” he said. “The work we do, not only is it fun, but it’s fascinating. And it’s meaningful and I’m still trying to spread the word to the day I leave because I think this population is going to face some significant challenges.

Dear Abby: Is teacher risking his job as he bends his instruction style for soon-to-be stepdaughters?,"DEAR ABBY: I’m getting married soon and I am very excited. It is a true blessing. I love my fiancee very much, and I’m happy to spend the rest of my life with her. I have one concern, though, and it is about her daughters. They are great girls. Both are teenagers. I have told them I will be whatever they want me to be, trying not to force any kind of relationship on them that they are not ready to have. My problem is, I am their teacher at the high school. I have excellent relationships with both girls, but in an effort to make things as comfortable for them at school as I can, I have distanced myself from the other students. I have become grumpier, and I’m quickly becoming the teacher with a lot of homework that all the students dislike. I was always the “nice” teacher, so this is a big change for me. However, I have done it because the girls are grateful for it. The “meaner” I am at school, the better my relationship with the girls is at home. The other girls in their classes gossip a lot, and they have said some disturbing things about me to the girls because I am marrying their mom. Am I doing the right thing? I’m beginning to be unhappy at work, but it is making my home life very nice with my brand-new family. -- PROFESSOR MEAN IN THE WEST DEAR PROF. MEAN: The right thing? Have you discussed this cockamamie plan with your principal? What is positive about going from being liked by your students to distancing yourself in order to turn your fiancee’s daughters into teacher’s pets? If this continues, they will be social pariahs. You should not have to choose between being popular at school or liked by your soon-to-be stepdaughters. In just a few years, they’ll be out of the house, and you will be the most disliked teacher at the school if you are still employed there. DEAR ABBY: I asked a woman I know out for coffee. She politely declined. I replied that I hoped my asking didn’t make things awkward between us and that we could continue being friends. She agreed, and our friendship continues. I’m in my early 50s. I’m guessing she’s in her late 60s or early 70s. I have always found more mature women to be attractive. We talk or text each other and, when the weather is nice, we talk outside. We actually had that coffee recently, which was platonic, unless I missed a sign she was putting out there. Abby, do you think societal pressures hold people back from pursuing relationships? Should I try to stick closer to my age range? -- READY AND WILLING IN NEW YORK DEAR READY: There are any number of reasons why people hold back from pursuing relationships. Chief among them is lack of chemistry rather than age difference. From what you have written, you have been put in the “friend” category. If you are looking for romance, you will have to look elsewhere. By sticking to your age range, you will eliminate that one factor but not the others.

"Asking Eric: How am I the ‘bad guy’ after family stole $100,000 and rings from my mother?","Dear Eric: My sister and I have never been close. My sister, I’ll call her Lydia, has been a pathological liar from the time she learned to speak. Our mom became terminally ill and was unable to stay by herself and was adamant that she would never be put long term in a nursing facility. She had the financial ability to pay for a caregiver to stay with her in her home. Mom’s grandson volunteered to stay with her. Because of her macular degeneration, Mom gave her grandson access to her financial information and added him as a signer. Long story short, the grandson embezzled more than $100,000. We made arrangements for a state-appointed guardian ad-litem to take over the finances immediately. The grandson was removed. Lydia had been a caregiver for more than 25 years, so she was hired. Six months later, Mom passed away quietly at her home. A few weeks later, I received a phone call from Lydia telling me that she had “accidentally” taken some of Mom’s rings home with her. She must have known the guardian would do an inventory and find them missing. She made up some ridiculous story about how they ended up in her purse. She even went so far as to tell me that she had taken them to a pawn shop to be appraised. She told me she would mail them back, which she did. So, I have been in a “no contact” mode, feeling very betrayed by Lydia. I was told by a family member that I need to get over it because “we all know how Lydia is.” I am hurt that I am being made out to be the “bad” one in this situation. I’m certain that the family has heard Lydia’s version of the truth that most likely has little resemblance to the actual facts. How do you suggest I handle this situation? – Ring of Truth Dear Ring: This is possibly the best of a series of bad outcomes. Lydia may have, as you suspect, tried to get away with stealing the rings but, ultimately, that didn’t happen and now the rings are back. You can’t control what Lydia does and you can’t control what your family thinks. If you don’t want to talk to her, you don’t have to, but if you’re going “no contact” as a way of teaching her a lesson or eliciting a change in behavior, you may continue to be frustrated. I understand that Lydia’s history of lying and the trauma of catching another relative embezzling from your mother has worn on you. I don’t think your response is unfair or unreasonable. But it will help you to say, “this person can’t help herself.” That’s not a clinical diagnosis, by the way. But sometimes people do things against their own best interest. It can feel like a betrayal, but I encourage you to set an internal boundary by thinking of it as a part of the constellation of problems that Lydia has, rather than an offense she committed against you. This isn’t so much for her benefit as it is for yours. Dear Eric: I have a 10-year relationship unmarried. My girlfriend continues to communicate with her 50-year-old son. Having him determine for her what to do in the relationship. She does not want to communicate with me. She tells me one day she loves me, the next day she does not want to talk. Should I just end the relationship? I’ve tried to explain to her the things she’s done to me, but she will not let me finish the conversation when I continue to explain her actions toward me. Is this a narcissist and should I just end the relationship completely? – Unloved Dear Unloved: First, a couple of follow-ups to ask yourself. Has it always been this way or is this new? Have you explored couple’s counseling (obviously, without the son)? Do you feel that the son’s influence on your girlfriend is more than just intrusive, i.e., emotionally manipulative? The answers to these questions probably won’t change the answer to your big question, but they may offer some context, or options for getting your girlfriend help. The big answer remains the same: this relationship isn’t working for you right now and it sounds like it’s time to separate. Communication is the cornerstone of a relationship, so if you can’t talk to each other (or, if she won’t talk to you), it’s hard to see a path forward. Are you happy together? Do you feel valued? In a relationship, you may not feel swoony and enamored every day, but this kind of hot/cold withholding that she’s doing is unhealthy and unkind. She’s not in the place to be the partner that either of you needs. Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O. Box 22474, Philadelphia, PA 19110.

Debate over ‘soft’ call in tense derby; ‘superstar’ verdict on NBA vet in OT thriller — NBL Wrap,"Sydney Kings reclaimed NBL bragging rights over bitter rivals Illawarra on Sunday, hammering the Hawks 98-71 in a Freeway Series blow-out at WIN Entertainment Centre. Watch live coverage of NBL and WNBL 2025-26 seasons with ESPN on Kayo Sports | New to Kayo? Join now and get your first month for just $1. Ending a six-game losing streak to the defending NBL champions stretching back to 2023, the Kings (7-5) led from start to finish to register their fourth straight victory, and the first for coach Brian Goorjian against Illawarra counterpart Justin Tatum. Despite the lopsided score, the game was a typically fiery affair between the NSW clubs in the first leg of the Adrian Hurley Cup and the famed Freeway Series. Referees handed out technical fouls to Sydney’s Xavier Cooks and Kouat Noi and Illawarra’s JaVale McGee and Todd Blanchfield, and blew an unsportsmanlike foul on Illawarra’s Mason Peatling, to maintain order on the court. Sydney were without veterans Matthew Dellavedova (calf) and Shaun Bruce (illness) but it mattered little as they successfully executed Goorjian’s game plan to stifle Hawks big man JaVale McGee with swarming defence under the basket. It was an unhappy afternoon for McGee, the three-time NBA champion, as he fouled out early in the fourth quarter with just nine points and nine rebounds to his name. The game was played at a frantic early pace as the teams combined for 12 first-quarter turnovers and ice-cold shooting, but Sydney settled better to lead 18-14 at the break. Leading 53-32 at half-time, the Kings held the hapless Hawks to their lowest scoring half of what has been a Jekyll-and-Hyde title defence so far. After successive wins against Melbourne and Cairns, the Hawks (5-6) remain in the bottom half of the ladder after another heavy defeat on their home floor. Illawarra rallied with the first nine points of the third quarter to cut the deficit to 53-41, forcing Goorjian to call a time out, but the Kings responded to re-establish their advantage and build a 71-50 lead heading into the final period. Role players shine The absence of Dellavedova and Bruce, and Cooks’s early foul trouble, created opportunities for rarely used bench players Tyler Robertson and Hunter Goodrick. Robertson, in only his sixth on-court appearance this season, delivered with an NBL career-high 14 points, including four-of-six from three-point range. Goodrick battled on the boards against McGee and Peatling when the game was still a contest and was rewarded with eight points and five rebounds. ‘Soft’ call turns heads Kings and former Hawks forward Xavier Cooks was called for a tech foul late in the second quarter after getting tangled up with Illawarra’s Davo Hickey on a rebounding contest. Cooks extended the hand of friendship to help his Australian Boomers teammate off the floor under the Illawarra basket but Hickey rejected the offer, so Cooks pushed his leg and walked away, only to be hit with a tech for his troubles. Hickey made the technical free throw but Cooks then knocked down his two free throws for the initial foul committed on him. After suggesting the call was “soft”, a smiling Cooks tried to high five with Hickey after hitting the two shots from the charity stripe, but Hickey again turned him down. Cooks had the last laugh against the club where he began his career, contributing 13 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Milestone men It was supposed to be a day of celebration for Hickey and Hawks teammate Todd Blanchfield, playing their 100th and 450th NBL games respectively, but it was anything but. Hickey (19 points, eight rebounds, eight assists) did all he could to spark the Hawks, but his energy and enthusiasm were not enough on a rough afternoon in Wollongong. Blanchfield was used sparingly off the bench and went scoreless until garbage time, knocking down a three-pointer, after picking up a tech foul for his part in a push-and-shove with Sydney’s Kouat Noi in the second quarter. ‘SUPERSTAR’ VERDICT ON EX-NBA VET AS BRYCE INSPIRES OT WIN Adelaide superstar Bryce Cotton inspired the 36ers in an overtime thriller against the Cairns Taipans on Sunday, with the five-time NBL MVP dropping a game-high 41 points in a pulsating four-point win. Mike Wells’ side took a 10-point lead into the final term at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre, but the rallying visitors sliced that margin to one point with just under a minute remaining. In a tense final minute of regulation, a turnover from Zylan Cheatham gave Cairns the ball with Marcus Lee fouled with 34 seconds left on the clock. Lee tied it up with his first shot, but missed the second, with Cotton missing two opportunities to take the win, with the game going to overtime where he got the job done. The brave Taipans trailed by three points with a minute remaining in overtime, but a Jack McVeigh foul on Cotton proved pivotal, with the star guard icing his free throws to seal the win that improves his side’s win-loss record to 9-3. McVeigh drained a career-high 39 points for the last-placed Taipans who slipped to a 3-11 record with the result. Isaac Humphries passed a pre-game fitness test after rolling an ankle in Thursday night’s win over Tasmania, and the star centre finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds. Hot starts stopped Adelaide had won 10 opening terms this season, and 13 of its past 14, but the visitors started brightly. Mojave King drained three triples to propel his side to a one-point lead at the first break, with McVeigh chipping in with 10 points as the Sixers struggled to get their offence humming. The home side shot 0-of-5 to start the game before Cotton drained his opening three-pointer and then added another triple to get Adelaide’s offence rolling. Welcome, Troy! New Adelaide import Troy Brown Jr checked into the game four minutes into the first quarter and the former NBA first-round draft pick made an immediate impact, draining his first shot as a Sixer. Brown Jr, a veteran of 356 NBA games, hadn’t played a game for seven months but showed few signs of rust in an impressive start. “He has the makings to be a superstar in this league,” NBL legend Andrew Gaze said of Brown Jr on ESPN. Triple trouble McVeigh continued on his merry way in the second quarter, leading all players with a game-high 22 points, including 4-of-5 shooting from three-point range, but the Taipans didn’t help their cause with Admiral Schofield and Lee whistled for unsportsmanlike fouls.

Late Hornets drive sinks Vandals in heartbreaker,"With 3 minutes and 14 seconds left in the game, the Sacramento State Hornets’ offense took the field against the Idaho Vandals’ defense. It proceeded to drive 67 yards down the field and scored on a 7-yard option play by junior quarterback Cardell Williams with just nine seconds left. This was the dagger that helped clinch a Sac State win as the Vandals fell to the Hornets 23-20 on Saturday at Hornet Field in Sacramento, Calif. The Idaho defense held strong for the majority of the game, but when it mattered most, it faltered. Idaho coach Thomas Ford Jr. said that on the last play, there were missed opportunities for the Vandals to make the play. “(The execution was) obviously not (done) very well. We’ve got to do a better job getting aligned properly, and we got to make the tackle,” Ford said. “We had a player that had a shot to make the tackle, and I don’t think he was aligned correctly, so it put him at a disadvantage, and obviously didn’t make the play.” The stagnant UI offense The offense did not find much success for the second straight game. Sophomore quarterback Joshua Wood was the lone bright spot for the Vandal offense. Wood rushed 14 times for 117 yards and one score on the ground. The rushing touchdown was the go-ahead score with 3:17 left in the fourth quarter, giving the Vandals hope to win the game, which gave Idaho the lead 20-16 after the extra point. But Wood did struggle through the air, only passing 15-for-26 with 162 yards and an interception. Sophomore running back Carlos Matheney was second on the team in rushing with six carries for 48 yards. True freshman wide receiver Nolan McWilliams led the Vandals in receiving with two catches for 49 yards. No other Idaho receiver had over 33 yards. Idaho offensive coordinator Matt Linehan, who usually is in the booth, was on the sideline during the game. Ford said that a possible change of venue could benefit the offense. “We were just trying to do something a little bit different, trying to get a little bit (of) something to kind of change up the rhythm of what we’re doing offensively,” Ford said. “And so I thought we made some really good adjustments. ... But I thought we had a lot more third-and-manageables in the second half, and we’re able to convert at a much higher level in the second half.” Idaho’s mostly strong defense The Idaho defense held strong for most of the contest, but two running backs had breakout games for the Hornets. Sac State senior Rodney Hammond Jr. broke 1,000 yards on the season during this game and rushed 26 times for 120 yards. True freshman running back Jaquail Smith ran 14 times for a gain of 122 yards for the Hornets. Even though those running backs gained a lot of yards, they were held out of the end zone. The Hornets were forced to kick three field goals and had only two touchdowns, including the game-winner with nine seconds left. Ford said he was impressed with how the defense performed against the elite running play of Sacramento State. “Gosh, especially against a really good running team, just to stop those guys on fourth-and-short not once, but twice, is very impressive,” Ford said. “I think our front seven has really turned a corner this season. Over the last five games, (they) have really done a great job being stingy against the run, and I thought they did another really good job today against one of the top rushing attacks in the country.” Junior linebacker Cruz Hepburn, of Lewiston High School, led the Vandals with 11 tackles (five solo) and had one-and-a-half tackles for loss, one sack and one forced fumble. Sophomore safety Zach Wusstig was second on the Vandals with 10 tackles (nine solo) and had one tackle for loss. A questionable call by officials During the last drive, the Hornets were forced to go for it on fourth-and-14, yet converted on a passing play from Cardell Williams to junior tight end Jordan Williams. Two plays after that, Sacramento State gained 18 yards on another pass from Cardell Williams to Jordan Williams that put the Hornets at the 2-yard line. The catch appeared to be out of bounds, but the play was reviewed extensively and was ruled a catch. “I have to question the call,” Ford said. “I don’t think that’s the right call. It got reviewed, and they said that there wasn’t enough evidence. ... We were in a position to make a play. Thought we made the play, but then we’re not given the play. So again, not talking about the officials, but they definitely missed one on that call. And I believe that they will see this and think the exact same.” What’s next? The Vandals are headed back to Moscow to play the Idaho State Bengals (5-6, 4-3) in a battle for the “Potato State Trophy.” The game will kick off at 1 p.m. Saturday at the P1FCU Kibbie Dome.

US aircraft carrier arrives in the Caribbean in major buildup near Venezuela,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation's most advanced aircraft carrier arrived in the Caribbean Sea on Sunday in a display of U.S. military power, raising questions about what the new influx of troops and weaponry could signal for the Trump administration's intentions in South America as it conducts military strikes against vessels suspected of transporting drugs. The arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford and other warships, announced by the Navy in a statement, marks a major moment in what the administration insists is a counterdrug operation but has been seen as an escalating pressure tactic against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Since early September, U.S. strikes have killed at least 80 people in 20 attacks on small boats accused of transporting drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean. The Ford rounds off the largest buildup of U.S. firepower in the region in generations. With its arrival, the “Operation Southern Spear"" mission includes nearly a dozen Navy ships and about 12,000 sailors and Marines. The carrier strike group, which includes squadrons of fighter jets and guided-missile destroyers, transited the Anegada Passage near the British Virgin Islands on Sunday morning, the Navy said. Rear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to ""protect our nation’s security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the Western Hemisphere.” Adm. Alvin Holsey, the commander who oversees the Caribbean and Latin America, said in a statement that the American forces “stand ready to combat the transnational threats that seek to destabilize our region.” Holsey, who will retire next month after just a year on the job, said the strike group's deployment is ""a critical step in reinforcing our resolve to protect the security of the Western Hemisphere and the safety of the American Homeland.” In Trinidad and Tobago, which is only 7 miles from Venezuela at its closest point, government officials said troops have begun “training exercises” with the U.S. military that will run through much of the week. Minister of Foreign Affairs Sean Sobers described the joint exercises as the second in less than a month and said they are aimed at tackling violent crime on the island nation, which has become a stopover point for drug shipments headed to Europe and North America. The prime minister has been a vocal supporter of the U.S. military strikes. The exercises will include Marines from the 22nd Expeditionary Unit who have been stationed aboard the Navy ships that have been looming off Venezuela's coast for months. Venezuela’s government has described the training exercises as an act of aggression. It had no immediate comment Sunday on the arrival of the aircraft carrier. Meanwhile, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said Sunday that U.S. troops have been training in Panama, underscoring the administration’s increasing focus on Latin America. “We’re reactivating our jungle school in Panama. We would be ready to act on whatever” Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth needed, he told CBS’ “Face the Nation."" The administration has insisted that the buildup of American forces in the region is focused on stopping the flow of drugs into the U.S., but it has released no evidence to support its assertions that those killed in the boats were “narcoterrorists.” Trump has indicated military action would expand beyond strikes by sea, saying the U.S. would ""stop the drugs coming in by land.” The U.S. has long used aircraft carriers to pressure and deter aggression by other nations because their warplanes can strike targets deep inside another country. Some experts say the Ford is ill-suited to fighting cartels, but it could be an effective instrument of intimidation for Maduro in a push to get him to step down. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the United States does not recognize Maduro, who was widely accused of stealing last year’s election, as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. Rubio has called Venezuela's government a “transshipment organization” that openly cooperates with those trafficking drugs. Maduro, who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S., has said the U.S. government is “fabricating” a war against him. On his Facebook page, Maduro wrote on Sunday that the “Venezuelan people are ready to defend their homeland against any criminal aggression.” Venezuela’s government recently touted a “massive” mobilization of troops and civilians to defend against possible U.S. attacks. Maduro and other officials in Venezuela’s socialist party also have been attending rallies this weekend to back the creation of neighborhood committees that will be in charge of increasing membership in Venezuela’s socialist party, and promoting the party’s policies. Trump has justified the attacks on drug boats by saying the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels while claiming the boats are operated by foreign terrorist organizations. He has faced pushback from leaders in the region, the U.N. human rights chief and U.S. lawmakers, including Republicans, who have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the boat strikes. Senate Republicans, however, recently voted to reject legislation that would have put a check on Trump’s ability to launch an attack against Venezuela without congressional authorization. Experts disagree on whether or not American warplanes may be used to strike land targets inside Venezuela. Either way, the 100,000-ton warship is sending a message. “This is the anchor of what it means to have U.S. military power once again in Latin America,” said Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for the Andes region. “And it has raised a lot of anxieties in Venezuela but also throughout the region. I think everyone is watching this with sort of bated breath to see just how willing the U.S. is to really use military force.” Associated Press writers Anselm Gibbs in Port of Spain, Trinidad, and Gabriela Molina in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.

Packers’ Josh Jacobs ruled out vs. Giants with knee injury,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Josh Jacobs left in the first half of the Green Bay Packers' 27-20 victory at the New York Giants on Sunday with a knee injury and the starting running back's status moving forward is uncertain. Jacobs appeared to hurt his left knee when he was knocked out of bounds by Jevon Holland on a run in the first quarter. He initially stayed in before going to the sideline in obvious pain and heading inside for further evaluation. It's unclear how serious the injury might be or if it will cause Jacobs to miss Green Bay's game next weekend against Minnesota. “Any time a player, especially of his magnitude, but any time a player doesn’t finish a game, you’re always concerned about the welfare of them,” coach Matt LaFleur said. Jacobs had seven carries for 40 yards before leaving. He entered the day second in the NFL in rushing touchdowns with 11, running for 608 yards in nine games. “I don’t think you have to adjust too much,” quarterback Jordan Love said. “I think obviously it’s tough whenever people go down, but like we always say, next-man-up mentality."" His departure came after Love exited with a left shoulder injury. Love returned later in the first half and called the soreness manageable. “It was definitely not fun,” said Love, who returned to throw two touchdown passes. “It’s just a small injury, so we’ll re-evaluate it when we get back, look at it, see what’s going on, but yeah it’s not fun.” With Jacobs out, Green Bay turned to Emanuel Wilson, who scored on an 11-yard TD run midway through the second quarter. The Packers had 106 yards rushing at halftime against New York, which has the second-worst run defense in the league, and finished with 128. “He did a great job tonight just finding ways to keep going,” Love said of Wilson. “I don’t think we changed things up much, kept going with our plan and our scheme and he made some big-time plays.”",2025-11-16 20:08:56,Sportsnet,negative,0.5029,0,Loss_After_Career, Green Bay Packers beat New York Giants 27-20 at Giants in New York on Sunday .

Calvin Ridley’s return for the Titans ends abruptly with ankle injury against Texans,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The Tennessee Titans will be without their No. 1 wide receiver and highest-paid player on the roster for the rest of the season. Interim coach Mike McCoy said after a 16-13 loss to Houston that Calvin Ridley broke his right leg in his first game back from a hamstring injury that kept him out of the last three games. “Feel for him,” McCoy said of Ridley. ""He worked so hard to get back to where he was and obviously that happened. Ridley came in second with 290 yards receiving for the Titans still looking for his first touchdown catch of the season. He led Tennessee with 1,017 yards receiving in 2024, his first with the Titans on a four-year deal worth up to $92 million. He caught a 13-yard pass from Cam Ward on the Titans' first offensive play before being tackled by Azeez Al-Shaair and Calen Bullock. Trainers came out to look at Ridley's ankle, he shook his head and lay back down on the ground before walking gingerly to the sideline. Once he got to the sideline, Ridley sat for a couple minutes on the table used in the medical tent. Then he got on a cart for a ride to the locker room. “For him to go down like that on a good day that I know he’s going to have, it’s just a bad feel for the offense because we lose a dynamic playmaker,"" Ward said. ""Even if he doesn’t get the ball ... it’s Calvin Ridley. You’ve got to respect him.” This was Ridley’s first game since the Titans’ Oct. 12 loss at Las Vegas. Ridley was limited to six offensive snaps in that game before hurting a hamstring, keeping him out of the last three games. The hamstring injury came just after Ridley had his best game this season against Arizona with five catches for 131 yards. Ridley wasn't the only player injured in Tennessee's receiving corps Sunday. Rookie Chimere Dike, who came in leading the NFL in all-purpose yards with his work as a punt and kick returner, didn't return after muffing a punt late in the first half. Fellow rookie Elic Ayomanor also has a hamstring issue. McCoy said Dike cleared concussion protocol, but is still being evaluated for a bruised chest. That left the Titans with veteran Van Jefferson and Mason Kinsey, who went undrafted out of Berry College in 2020 and started on New England's practice squad. Kinsey, who has been with the Titans since 2021, caught one pass for 14 yards. Ward took blame for missing a wide-open Kinsey in the third near the end zone.",2025-11-16 20:08:56,Sportsnet,neutral,0.5954,0,Loss_After_Career, Calvin Ridley broke his right leg in his first game back from a hamstring injury .

England completes perfect World Cup qualifying campaign,"TIRANA, Albania — Perfect England is heading to the World Cup with a 100 per cent qualifying record. A 2-0 win against Albania on Sunday made it eight wins from eight for Thomas Tuchel's team, which also booked its place in next year's tournament without conceding a goal. England had already qualified before completing its final Group K match, but finished in style with another win. All-time leading scorer Harry Kane hit both goals in Tirana to extend his record to 78 goals in 112 games for his country. “We’ve set the standard now, especially in the last few camps,” the England captain told broadcaster ITV. “We're going to go into the tournament as one of the favourites. We have to accept that, it's been like that for the last few tournaments.” Kane's record in all competitions for Bayern Munich and England this season stands at 25 goals in 18 appearances. Tuchel was hired last year with the initial task of leading England into the World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The English Football Association believes the coach can end the nation's decades-long wait for a major title, with England having not won the World Cup since 1966. England heads into next year's tournament having reached the final of the last two European Championships. ""We’ve been building, we’ve had a great year together with the new coach, and now we look forward to a big 2026,” Kane said.",2025-11-16 20:08:54,Sportsnet,positive,0.9156,88,Cancelled_Jayson_Sky, Harry Kane scores twice as England beats Albania 2-0 to qualify for the World Cup in 2026 .

Sinner beats Alcaraz to defend ATP Finals title before home fans,"TURIN, Italy — The final installment of the “Sincaraz” rivalry for 2025 went to Jannik Sinner. The second-ranked Sinner beat top-ranked Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (4), 7-5 for the ATP Finals trophy on Sunday in the sixth meeting this year between the two players who are dominating men’s tennis. Sinner defended the title before his home Italian fans for only his second victory over Alcaraz this year after also beating the Spaniard in the Wimbledon final. “It was an incredible season,” Sinner said. “To finish it this way, before my Italian fans, is very special for me.” Alcaraz had already secured the year-ending No. 1 ranking and was contesting his first final at the event for the year’s top eight players. Alcaraz still leads his career meetings with Sinner, 10-6. Sinner and Alcaraz have met in the last three Grand Slam finals. Alcaraz beat Sinner in a fifth-set tiebreaker to win the French Open; Sinner gained a measure of revenge at Wimbledon; then Alcaraz again came out on top at the U.S. Open. They also clashed this year in the Italian Open final (won by Alcaraz) and the Cincinnati Open final (won by Alcaraz when Sinner retired due to illness). “I hope you are going to be ready for next year because I will be ready to hopefully play more finals against you,” Alcaraz said during the trophy ceremony. To which Sinner added that he hopes they have “great, great battles ahead of us.” Sinner also won the Australian Open — beating Alexander Zverev in the final — so he and Alcaraz each won two majors this year. In all, Alcaraz has won six majors and Sinner has won four. St. Sinner Already early in the first set, the pro-Sinner crowd chanted its customary “Ole, Ole, Ole, Ole; Sin-ner, Sin-ner.” One fan even held up an image of Sinner depicted as a saint. Sinner saved a set point at 5-6 in the tight first set with a big second serve that Alcaraz couldn’t return. Then the Italian took control of the tiebreaker by running down a drop shot and responding with a lob that led to an overhead put away. “I’m extremely happy with how I handled the situation,” Sinner said of saving the set point. Added Alcaraz, “He came up with a second serve 185-190 kph (115-118 mph) that surprised me.” Alcaraz’s thigh Alcaraz had his right thigh treated by a trainer on two occasions — and got it wrapped after the first set. “Didn’t affect me too much, to be honest, because I could run well,” Alcaraz said. Alcaraz broke Sinner’s serve in the opening game of the second set but Sinner then evened it at 3-3. Sinner then got the crowd going again in the next game when he won a long rally and held his finger to his ear — signaling for more noise inside the Inalpi Arena. Sinner broke Alcaraz again to close it out when the Spaniard missed a backhand wide – then fell down to the court on his back in relief. “It was a huge emotion,” said Sinner, who was banned for three months earlier in the year after settling a doping case. Alcaraz led 28-25 in winners but also had more unforced errors, 26-24. Sinner said he wanted to improve his serve after the loss to Alcaraz at the U.S. Open and he led 8-5 in aces but also had five double-faults to Alcaraz’s none. It was Sinner’s 10th straight win at the finals stretching back to his loss to Novak Djokovic in the 2023 final. What’s more is that Sinner hasn’t lost a set in that stretch. Sinner also extended his winning streak on indoor hard courts to 31 matches. In the doubles final, Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten beat Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski 7-5, 6-3.",2025-11-16 20:08:51,Sportsnet,positive,0.6633,66,Beating_Ktm_Matches," Jannik Sinner beats top-ranked Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (4), 7-5 for the ATP Finals trophy in Italy .

"Madam Yang Yang Pushes Local Talent, Innovation in Industrial Sector","Madam Yang Yang, Executive Officer of Zonda Tec Ghana Limited, has reaffirmed the company’s commitment to driving Ghana’s industrial growth through skills development, localisation, and strong community partnerships. Speaking in an interview with the media, Madam Yang outlined how Zonda Tec Ghana has evolved into a major force in the country’s heavy-duty automobile and equipment industry. Under her leadership, the company she said has expanded its footprint across Ghana and the West African sub-region, supplying heavy-duty trucks, construction equipment, and comprehensive technical support services. But beyond market expansion, Madam Yang stressed that Zonda Tec’s mission is rooted in human development. “Our greatest achievement is not measured in the number of trucks we sell, but in the number of Ghanaian youths we empower to build and maintain those trucks,” she said. Over the years, the company has invested heavily in training academies and technical programmes, creating opportunities for artisans, technicians, and engineers to gain industry-relevant skills. Many of these trainees have secured employment in the competitive automobile and machinery sector, a development Madam Yang describes as central to true industrialization. “A nation is built not by machines alone, but by the hands and minds that operate them. Ghana has the talent, our role is to help unlock it,” she added. Madam Yang attributes the company’s steady growth to a blend of strategic leadership and an appreciation of Ghana’s cultural and business environment. This approach has strengthened Zonda Tec’s partnerships with transport unions, construction firms, government institutions, and universities, ensuring sustainable operations across the country. Looking ahead, she shared the company’s long-term vision of a locally driven heavy-equipment ecosystem powered by Ghanaian expertise. “We are here to build an ecosystem not just a business. When local expertise thrives, the entire economy moves forward,” she said. She also emphasised resilience as a core pillar of Zonda Tec’s operations. “The real test of leadership is not how you perform when the market is favourable, but how you stay committed when conditions are tough,” she noted. Zonda Tec Ghana plans to expand its assembly operations, establish advanced auto-mechanical training centres, and extend its services to new industrialising zones across the country. As the conversation drew to a close, Madam Yang offered a reflection that captured her leadership philosophy and dedication to Ghana’s development: “We are guests in this beautiful country, but our hearts work as citizens. Ghana’s progress is our progress.”",2025-11-16 20:08:47,Ghanamma,positive,0.8267,42,Market_Between_Business," Madam Yang Yang, Executive Officer of Zonda Tec Ghana Limited, reaffirmed commitment to driving Ghana’s industrial growth through skills development, localisation, and strong community partnerships .

Robert MacIntyre offers brutally honest verdict on DP World Tour display,"Robert MacIntyre was livid with his performance following Sunday's concluding round at the DP World Tour Championship, harshly confessing his putting was ""abysmal"" despite posting a 68. MacIntyre concluded the tournament in a tie for eighth place after recording 14-under par, finishing four shots behind leaders Matt Fitzpatrick and Rory McIlroy. Following a dramatic playoff between the Ryder Cup partners, Fitzpatrick claimed victory, while McIlroy secured the Race to Dubai crown. Though it represented a solid conclusion for MacIntyre, who has risen to No. 7 in the global rankings following an outstanding season, he was devastated by his short game struggles. Having captured the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship on home soil in Scotland and placing runner-up at the U.S. Open, MacIntyre now holds himself to elevated expectations. Upon completing Sunday's round, MacIntyre showed no interest in accentuating the positive and slammed his own showing. ""I didn't putt good enough today,"" MacIntyre told The Scotsman. ""Yesterday I hit it terribly, went on the range, phoned Simon [Shanks, his coach] and got it back. Today I had my chances to get right in about it, but I just putted like a d---, to be honest."" With the 2025 campaign concluding, MacIntyre will compete in his season finale at the Tiger Woods-hosted Hero World Challenge next month. Even after reaching No. 7 in the rankings and experiencing a breakthrough year, MacIntyre won't accept anything less than excellence. ""This is the level I expect myself to be playing at,"" he added. ""Look, I wasn't well last week and felt like what I got out of it was brilliant. It was almost the maximum I could get out of it. This week, it was a good opportunity. ""I felt like I played nicely for probably 36-40 holes but, other than that, it was a struggle. Yeah, it shows my attitude is good when I am over the shot and I am committed to the shot. There is no thinking about the last shot. But, look, I let my anger out like everyone does and it might just show a bit more."" MacIntyre eventually found some silver linings in his display, but swiftly returned to criticizing his putting performance. ""I fought well, especially in the middle of the round,"" MacIntyre added. ""But, from yesterday's performance and Friday's performance, going into today was like 'what's coming?' But I thought I played really well today - just putted abysmal. I had so many chances and not just from your 50-50 range. ""From your good five to six feet, including one at the last. Just disappointing with the way I putted."" While MacIntyre battled to find bright spots, Fitzpatrick was absolutely thrilled after transforming his season and securing triumph.",2025-11-17 08:05:00,Daily Express Us,negative,0.5943,82,Dellavedova_Novak_Blanchfield, Robert MacIntyre was livid with his performance at the DP World Tour Championship .

Tom Brady offers priceless advice to new colleague before FOX NFL Sunday debut,"Tom Brady offered some sage advice to fellow future Hall of Fame quarterback and colleague Drew Brees before his first appearance in the broadcast booth for FOX. Brees, who was brought on board by FOX as an analyst prior to NFL Week 11, teamed up with play-by-play announcer Adam Amin in the booth for the Green Bay Packers' matchup against the New York Giants. Brees appeared alongside Brady, who joined FOX as an analyst before the 2024 season, on the FOX NFL Sunday pregame show, where the seven-time Super Bowl champion offered a priceless piece of guidance to his colleague. ""Oh man, I'll tell you what, I'm glad I'm not a rookie anymore,"" Brady said when asked if he had any words for Brees ahead of his FOX debut. ""I'd warn him of all the mistakes I made in my first year but we'd be here for an hour, so I'm not going to tell you any of those things. He knows what to do, have fun, just enjoy yourself, and don't read all those social media comments after."" Brees replied: ""We're just gonna turn it loose baby."" “Don’t read all those social media comments.” @TomBrady gave some advice to @drewbrees before his broadcast booth debut today on FOX! pic.twitter.com/Jc2HQHVWkt Brees, who spent 20 NFL seasons with the New Orleans Saints and San Diego Chargers, was brought in to take over from Mark Sanchez on the FOX broadcast team after Sanchez was dismissed by the network following an October stabbing incident that resulted in him facing at least one felony charge and three misdemeanors. Although under contract with FOX, Brees is also scheduled to appear on the coverage for Netflix's Christmas Day games for a second consecutive year. Brady, who joined FOX as their premier NFL analyst on a contract exceeding $300 million, faced significant criticism from fans and pundits during what he characterized as a season of ""growing pains"" in his debut year behind the microphone. Both former signal-callers have considerable ground to cover if their broadcasting tenures are to match their on-field achievements. Brady and Brees hold the top two spots, respectively, on the NFL's all-time lists for passing yards and touchdown passes. Although Brees is stepping into the FOX broadcast booth for the first time in Week 11, this isn't his initial foray as an NFL television analyst. During the previous season, he participated in Netflix's Christmas Day broadcast panel for the Texans-Ravens and Steelers-Chiefs matchups. Brees has also been featured on ESPN's morning programs 'First Take' and 'Get Up. '. Following his retirement from professional football in 2020, Brees joined NBC, contributing as an analyst for the network's Notre Dame football coverage and Football Night in America. He departed from NBC in May 2022.",2025-11-17 08:05:00,Daily Express Us,positive,0.5235,0,Loss_After_Career, Tom Brady offered some advice to fellow future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees before his first appearance in the broadcast booth for FOX .

Brad Binder relieved ‘tough year’ in MotoGP is done and dusted,"Home » Motoring By Jaco Van Der Merwe Head of Motoring 3 minute read 17 November 2025 10:05 am Brad Binder has one more year left on his contract. Picture: Red Bull KTM Brad Binder was a relieved man when the curtain came down on the MotoGP season in Valencia on Sunday. He stormed from 15th on the grid to cross the line in a solid eighth place, but failed to break into the top 10 in the championship standings. His 11th place is his joint worse premier class finish along with his rookie season in 2020. In the four years in between, the Red Bull KTM man recorded one fourth-place and three sixth-place finishes. Despite the RC16’s well-documented issues, Binder factory KTM team-mate Pedro Acosta adapted much better to the bike this year.

He will be under huge pressure to raise his game in the 2026 season as his contract ends at the end of next season. “I wanted more from today. I wanted to pick-off more guys but I lacked a bit more pace and the best I could manage today was eighth,” Binder told the KTM website after Sunday’s race. “A tough year.

After The Hunt: What We Know So Far,"Luca Guadagnino is so back. The Oscar-nominated director’s new film, After the Hunt, was officially released in October. The film is written by first-time screenwriter Nora Garrett and stars Julia Roberts, Ayo Edebiri, and Andrew Garfield. Here’s everything we know about the psychological drama. The film follows a college professor (Julia Roberts) who gets caught in the middle of a campus scandal after her student (Ayo Edebiri) accuses one of her colleagues (Andrew Garfield) of “crossing the line.” Per IndieWire, on an episode of the podcast WTF with Marc Maron, Guadagnino shared that After The Hunt is one of his “very rare” films that isn’t about “sexuality or love.” “It’s a very timely movie for where we are now,” he said, “in terms of the society and the division in society and the extreme positions that we can have vis-a-vis an opinion in a way. It’s about what happens in the milieu of academia between younger and older people and the idea of consent. I can tell you that it’s very loaded. I can tell you that the movie is very provocative, but not in a stupid way, but I would say in a very articulate way.” He also added that this is Roberts’s “best performance” of her career. In another interview, Guadagnino also spoke about how much he enjoyed working with Edebiri. “Ayo is a movie star in the real sense of bigness, and cinema, and excitement,” he told W. “She has a commitment toward performance that you rarely find now. She absolutely commands your gaze. She’s funny and she’s extremely beautiful—and that is a very rare combination.” In addition to Roberts, Edebiri, and Garfield, Michael Stuhlbarg and Chloë Sevigny round out the cast. In an interview with Deadline at this year’s CinemaCon, Garfield revealed what it was like to work with Guadagnino for the first time. “What was exciting and surprising about being with Luca on set was how loose he is, how relaxed he is, how spontaneous, in the moment, and totally focused [he is] when he needs to be,” he said. “He seems to be allowing the day, the scene, and the moment to be found. And he’s such a precise filmmaker, simultaneously.” Edebiri echoed those sentiments. She said that filming with Guadagnino was a “mix of complete openness and specificity of vision.” She continued, “As an actor that fosters you to come up with so many things and understandings of your character.” Yes!

Cornelius Chapel: Ephesians,"The New Testament Book of Ephesians is a letter that Paul wrote to the church at Ephesus while he was a prisoner in Rome. Paul had spent two years building up the people of the church, and now he is writing to them about the many spiritual blessings that Christians enjoy. Paul describes the heavenly call to the saints, or believers, to live up to God's standards of conduct. He explains that when a person accepts Christ he receives a new relationship with God: his citizenship is in heaven, not of the earth, and he becomes spiritually alive. Paul also gives some practical advice for living the Christian life and for overcoming sin. This letter shows that a person becomes a Christian by faith in Jesus Christ and not by doing good deeds. He also explains that Christianity is for people of all nations, languages, and social levels. Paul reminds the church that every believer is given some spiritual gift or ability that is to be used in building the church. This letter should remind us to praise God for all that he has given us, and provide us with a greater desire to persuade people to receive Jesus Christ. Jerry Griffith is pastor of Cornelius Chapel.

USC study links ultra-processed food intake to prediabetes in young adults,"Researchers tracked 85 young adults over a four-year period, finding that increases in ultra-processed food consumption were linked with elevated blood sugar and early signs of diabetes risk. Image/iStock More than half of calories consumed in the United States come from ultra-processed foods (UPFs), items like fast food and packaged snacks that are often high in sodium, sugar and unhealthy fats. In adults, research has clearly linked these foods to type 2 diabetes and other conditions, but few studies have explored their effects among youth. Now, researchers from the Keck School of Medicine of USC have completed one of the first studies to examine the link between UPF consumption and how the body processes glucose, which is known to predict diabetes risk. By tracking changes over time, they gained insights into how dietary choices may influence key biological processes. The researchers studied a group of 85 young adults over a four-year period. They found that an increase in UPF intake was associated with a higher risk for prediabetes, or early-stage high blood sugar that can lead to diabetes. Eating more UPFs was also linked to insulin resistance, where the body becomes less effective at using insulin to control blood sugar. The study, funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, was just published in the journal Nutrition and Metabolism. “Our findings show that even modest increases in ultra-processed food intake can disrupt glucose regulation in young adults at risk for obesity. These results point to diet as a modifiable driver of early metabolic disease, and an urgent target for prevention strategies among young people,” said Vaia Lida Chatzi, MD, PhD, a professor of population and public health sciences and pediatrics and director of the Southern California Superfund Research and Training Program for PFAS Assessment, Remediation and Prevention (ShARP) Center at the Keck School of Medicine, who is the study’s senior author. Early adulthood is a formative stage where people have reached physical maturity and are building habits that can persist for years. Trading packaged or restaurant meals for whole and raw foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can reduce the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. “Young adulthood is a critical window for shaping long-term health,” Chatzi said. “By focusing on young adults, we have an opportunity to intervene early, before prediabetes and other risk factors become lifelong conditions.” Signs of prediabetes The research included 85 young adults from the Metabolic and Asthma Incidence Research (Meta-AIR) study, part of the broader Southern California Children’s Health Study. Participants, aged 17-22, provided data at a baseline visit between 2014 and 2018 and a follow-up visit approximately four years later. At each visit, participants reported everything they had eaten on one recent weekday and one recent weekend day. Researchers classified foods into two categories: UPFs (such as candy, soda, cereal, packaged spreads, flavored yogurts, and many restaurant foods) and foods that were not ultra-processed. They then calculated what percentage of each participant’s daily caloric intake came from UPFs. The researchers also collected blood samples from participants before and after they consumed a sugary drink to test how effectively their body responded to blood sugar with insulin. They then conducted a statistical analysis to compare dietary changes with signs of prediabetes, adjusting for differences in age, sex, ethnicity and physical activity levels. From baseline to follow-up, a 10% increase in UPF consumption was associated with a 64% higher risk for prediabetes and a 56% higher risk for problems with glucose regulation. Participants who reported eating more UPFs at their initial visit were also more likely to have elevated insulin levels at follow-up—an early sign of insulin resistance, where the body must produce more insulin to keep blood sugar in a healthy range. Limiting ultra-processed foods The study shows that the risks of UPFs extend to young adults, a group often overlooked in previous research. “These findings indicate that ultra-processed food consumption increases the risk for pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes among young adults—and that limiting consumption of those foods can help prevent disease,” said the study’s first author, Yiping Li, a doctoral student in quantitative biomedical sciences at Dartmouth College who previously worked as a researcher at the Keck School of Medicine. Future studies with larger groups and more detailed diet tracking can help clarify which foods pose the greatest risk for young adults, the researchers said. They also plan to continue investigating the biological mechanisms behind these links, including how specific nutrients in UPFs may influence insulin and blood sugar regulation.

David William Lenherr,"Birth: 1963 Death: 2025 David William Lenherr was born at Marin General Hospital on October 2, 1963 and was raised in Mill Valley where he spent much of his life. After an 8 month battle with cancer David passed away peacefully in Tiburon on November 9, 2025. Donald and Carol Lenherr’s first born bundle of joy was an adorable, talented, and very funny child. Dave was a character! He loved to laugh and made people laugh. Packed with personality, a quick wit and the gift of gab, he could talk your head off! He knew everyone, everywhere. He had a steel trap memory and loved to BS and tell stories. Dave was passionate about baseball. He was the home run king during MV Little League at Boyle Park and once cleared the American League field, from the National League side, with the ball landing on Buena Vista Ave. That inspired one of his many nicknames, Longball Lenherr. He played on a championship team at Redwood HS and traveled with them to play in Taiwan which was a highlight. After high school he played for American River College in Sacramento and for College of Marin until an injury derailed his further college ball pursuits at ASU. He continued to play in adult leagues with friends into his early 50s. Dave also loved mountain biking on Mt. Tam. At the birth of mountain biking in the 1970s he built a custom bomber bike from scratch in his parents’ garage. He had encyclopedic knowledge of all things bikes and had a workshop to repair and retool them which he continued to do up until last year. Dave was a sportsman. Some of his most cherished memories were hunting with his father, grandfather and family friends at their properties in Cloverdale and Colusa. They also shared many great memories fishing and crabbing at Lake Shasta, on the SF Bay and the Pacific Ocean. Dave loved dogs. Shortly after he was born his parents adopted the first of many family dogs, a beagle mix named Charlie Brown. He and Charlie “shared” the same birthday for the next 15 years. In recent years Dave could be seen around Mill Valley with a pocket full of dog treats always trying to make people laugh and smile. Dave was a foodie. He loved to talk about food and had binders full of recipes. He was fortunate to have dined at some of the finest restaurants with family, friends and clients. Recently, from his hospital bed, he phoned a local market to confirm that they’d be bringing in fresh crab from Washington state for Thanksgiving. He was also looking forward to dining at the House of Prime Rib once he was well enough to enjoy it. Dave loved music. He began his career at the World of Sound working in sales with clients out of their Strawberry and San Francisco locations. He consulted on the design and installation of high-end home entertainment systems. Some of his clients included famous local musicians and record producers. After nearly 10 yrs in the AV industry Dave parlayed his natural gift for connecting with people into a 20 year career in insurance. He began with National Life of Vermont in their San Francisco office. He covered all product lines but was especially partial to working with business owners on their Disability policies. For a 30th birthday trip he and his sister, Julie, met up with their parents in Munich where they were on a business trip. After touring Germany and Austria with them he and Julie took off for Italy and Greece. David wished to be buried with the St. Christopher medal he purchased at the Vatican during that trip, and more than 30 years later he was still in touch with fellow travelers with whom they had a blast scootering around Santorini. He appreciated lasting relationships and treasured many lifelong friends. David endured intense treatment that took its toll on him, yet he still managed to entertain his care teams at UCSF and Marin Health. David wished to give a special shout out to his sisters, Lori and Julie – his tireless advocates and caregivers for the past 8 months. David’s family would like to extend their gratitude to many friends who were there for him with phone calls, visits, cards, taking him to church, running errands for him, and watching sports with him – especially Jim O’ (Smokey), Brian, and Flach. David is survived by his loving mother, Carol, his sisters, Lori and Julie (Scott) Edson, his niece, nephews, brother-in-law, aunts, uncle and cousins. David was preceded in death by his father, Donald, whom he admired and missed dearly, and his adoring grandparents, Ada and Bill Lenherr. In lieu of flowers the family ask that you please consider donations in David’s memory to the Junior Giants at the Giants Community Fund or your favorite animal charity.

Ex-US Treasury chief steps back from public roles over Epstein ties,"Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said he will step back from most public roles over his past ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, saying he was ""deeply ashamed"" of his actions, media reports said. ""I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,"" Summers said in a statement circulated to several U.S. media outlets. ""I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused."" Summers served under former president Bill Clinton and later advised former president Barack Obama, as well as presiding over Harvard University in the early 2000s. Until now, he had combined his Harvard professorship with roles including board member at OpenAI and columnist at Bloomberg News. Emails and text messages released recently by a U.S. House committee showed extensive personal exchanges between Summers and Epstein, ending shortly before Epstein's arrest in 2019. Harvard's student newspaper, The Crimson, reported that the messages included disparaging remarks about women. Summers said he will continue teaching but withdraw from public commitments to rebuild trust and repair personal relationships. Epstein, a wealthy financier with high-profile connections, sexually abused and trafficked dozens of women and minors over many years. He died in a New York jail in 2019 at the age of 66 in what officials ruled a suicide. House lawmakers are expected to vote on Tuesday on whether to release investigative records related to the Epstein case. However, it remains unclear whether the documents will ultimately be made public.",2025-11-18 08:05:00,Daily Sabah,negative,0.527,11,Against_Donald_Trump," Larry Summers: ""I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein"" Epstein sexually abused and trafficked dozens of women and minors over many years .

US House votes to force release of Epstein files after Republican feud,"World US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries speaks during an event with fellow House Democratic members on the steps of the US Capitol, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, US, Nov 12, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Elizabeth Frantz) WASHINGTON: The Republican-controlled US Congress voted almost unanimously on Tuesday (Nov 18) to force the release of Justice Department files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, an outcome President Donald Trump had fought for months before ending his opposition. Two days after Trump's abrupt about-face, the House of Representatives passed the measure with a vote of 427-1, sending a resolution requiring the release of all unclassified records on Epstein to the Republican-majority Senate, which swiftly approved it. The Bill could now go to Trump for his signature as soon as Wednesday. Trump plans to sign the Bill when it reaches his desk, a senior White House official said. The Epstein scandal has been a political thorn in Trump’s side for months, partly because he amplified conspiracy theories about Epstein to his own supporters. Many Trump voters believe his administration has covered up Epstein’s ties to powerful figures and obscured details surrounding his death, which was ruled a suicide, in a Manhattan jail in 2019. Epstein was a New York financier who fraternised with some of the most powerful men in the country. Before the House vote, about two dozen survivors of Epstein's alleged abuse joined a trio of Democratic and Republican lawmakers outside the US Capitol to urge the release of the records. The women held photographs of their younger selves, the age at which they said they first encountered Epstein. After the vote, they stood to applaud lawmakers from the House's public gallery, some of them crying and hugging each other. Despite his changed position on the Bill, Trump remains angry about the attention paid to the Epstein matter. On Tuesday, he called a reporter who asked about it in the Oval Office a ""terrible person"" and said the television network the journalist works for should have its license revoked. ""I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein,"" the Republican president told reporters while hosting a visit by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""I threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert."" The White House was caught off guard by how quickly the measure passed through Congress, having expected it to take longer in the Senate, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. The fight over the Epstein papers has taken a toll on Trump's public approval, which fell to its lowest point this year in a Reuters/Ipsos poll concluded on Monday, which found that just one in five voters overall approved of his handling of the matter. Among Republicans, just 44 per cent thought Trump was handling the situation well. Trump socialised and partied with Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s before what he calls a rift, but the old friendship has become a rare weak spot for the president with his supporters. ""Please stop making this political, it is not about you, President Trump,"" Jena-Lisa Jones, who said Epstein sexually abused her when she was 14, told a press conference outside the Capitol a few hours before the vote. ""I voted for you, but your behaviour on this issue has been a national embarrassment."" Trump has said he had no connection to Epstein's crimes and has begun calling the issue a ""Democratic hoax"", even as some Republicans were among the loudest voices calling for the release of the records from criminal investigations of Epstein. Representative Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who led the effort to force the vote, accused the Justice Department from the House floor of ""protecting pedophiles and sex traffickers"". ""How will we know if this Bill has been successful?"" he said before the vote. ""We will know when there are men, rich men, in handcuffs, being perp-walked to the jail. And until then, this is still a cover-up."" Trump's opposition soured relations with one of his strongest Republican supporters in Congress, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, who has expressed anger at the Justice Department's not releasing more details on Epstein. She said Trump pressured her to withdraw her support for the resolution and publicly called her a traitor after she doubled down. She joined Massie and Democratic Representative Ro Khanna at the Capitol before voting in favour of the resolution, telling reporters: ""A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves. A patriot is an American that serves the United States of America, and Americans like the women standing behind me."" Epstein pleaded guilty to a Florida state felony prostitution charge in 2008 and served 13 months in jail. The US Justice Department charged him with sex trafficking of minors in 2019.

A Pennsylvania synagogue opened its doors to a local church,"THE REV. ADAM HEARLSON, left, of Overbrook Presbyterian Church and Rabbi Ethan Witkovsky pose at Temple Beth Hillel-Beth El in Wynnewood, Oct. 28. PHILADELPHIA — Rabbi Ethan Witkovsky and the Rev. Adam Hearlson seem like they've been friends forever. Witkovsky, 41, is the senior rabbi at Temple Beth Hillel-Beth El (TBH-BE), a Conservative movement synagogue in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania. Hearlson, 44, is the pastor at Overbrook Presbyterian Church (OPC), in Philadelphia. Sitting in the basement of an Abington senior center after a meeting of Montgomery County faith leaders in mid-October, the two finished each other's sentences as they told the story of the collaboration between their two congregations, one that began after a fire destroyed OPC's sanctuary in 2024. While the collaboration began as a logistical favor, Witkovsky and Hearlson say it has grown into something ""deeply profound."" Through Bible and Torah studies, holidays, lunches, and Easter egg hunts, the partnership has now stretched across time and tradition, bringing the communities into a lasting cycle of allyship and understanding. The beginning of a partnership Witkovsky and Hearlson met at a 2023 barbecue during Sukkot, a week-long Jewish harvest holiday. Hearlson joked that someone said, ""You guys need to meet because you're tall, or whatever."" (Hearlson is 6′7″ and Witkovsky is 6′5″). The two got to talking — about religion, philosopher Aldo Leopold, and a Wisconsin naturalist they both like. A friendship was born. On Jan. 15, 2024, a fire erupted in OPC's historic sanctuary, displacing the nearly 350 people who called the church their spiritual home. Repair costs were estimated to be close to $10 million. TBH-BE quickly jumped in to help. Shortly after the fire, OPC began to gather at the synagogue for Bible study and board meetings. Other religious organizations also stepped up to the plate, as well, including Penn Wynne Presbyterian Church, St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Ardmore, and the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas in Overbrook. As TBH-BE and OPC began to regularly cohabitate, Witkovsky and Hearlson's friendship deepened. Witkovsky had arrived at TBH-BE from a large New York synagogue with multiple staff members. At the time OPC moved in, he was TBH-BE's only rabbi. Sharing space with Hearlson and having another clergy person ""wander into my office"" to discuss everything from scripture to emails ""was amazing,"" he said. 'These guys are here for us' In March 2024, a sign outside TBH-BE reading ""Our Community Stands With Israel"" was vandalized twice with a swastika. At a prayer service shortly after, members of both congregations stood together. Witkovsky and Hearlson both spoke. ""That was a huge thing for my community of, like, 'These guys are here for us,'"" Witkovsky said. What followed is what Hearlson and Witkovsky described as a self-sustaining cycle of camaraderie, one borne out of the fire at OPC and forged by the vandalism at TBH-BE. ""The hope,"" Hearlson said, ""is that you don't remember who started the mutual circle of care, that it continues to feed back on itself over and over again, and you live in that circle, recognizing its goodness."" (During the interview, Witkovsky told Hearlson that all of the money OPC donated to TBH-BE would be put back into OPC's building fund — the circular care in action.) In the months that followed the vandalism, the two communities shared scripture, bagels, and multipurpose rooms. Elizabeth Cosgriff, a member of OPC, attended a study session in which Witkovsky and Hearlson each taught a piece of scripture from the other's tradition. She described a ""depth of scholarship"" from Witkovsky, who spoke about Jesus' teachings in the Sermon on the Mount. That night, Hearlson taught a passage from the Talmud, the central text of Jewish religious law. ""It helped broaden my understanding of Judaism and appreciate the connections,"" Cosgriff said. A Kosher-for-Passover Easter egg hunt A test for the budding interfaith partnership came around Easter. OPC needed a place to hold services, and Witkovsky suggested the synagogue. For both the pastor and the rabbi, it was ""a novel idea."" ""The cultural religious power has been in the hands of Christians for so long,"" Hearlson said, explaining the unease many of his congregants felt about putting up a cross and hosting Easter in a Jewish space. ""That was not lost on us."" But for TBH-BE, it was a no-brainer. Anna Caplan, who serves on the synagogue's board of directors, said there was ""immediate enthusiasm."" Easter landed on the eighth night of Passover, meaning the church and synagogue would be holding services at the same time. That night, around 200 Jews and 300 Christians gathered under the same roof to pray separately, but together, about rebirth and renewal. Hearlson and Witkovsky trade off recalling one detail with laughter. Because Easter and Passover overlapped, Witkovsky quickly realized OPC would not be able to bring sacramental bread into the synagogue. Instead, its congregants would have to take communion with matzah, the unleavened bread eaten on Passover. Hearlson described leading from the pulpit as the congregation went to take communion. Suddenly, there was ""an audible crunch."" ""And I'm like, 'I don't think I've ever heard that in a Christian service before,'"" Hearlson said. At the end of the service, Hearlson invited congregants to sing Handel's ""Hallelujah"" chorus. Both Christians and Jews joined him. ""I felt a real sense of belonging even though I hadn't met most of the people there,"" said Caplan, one of the TBH-BE congregants who volunteered to sing. Afterward, the two communities shared a meal and an Easter egg hunt on the synagogue lawn. Inside the Easter eggs was Kosher-for-Passover candy, selected so Jewish children could participate, too. One TBH-BE congregant kept the plastic Easter egg to put on his Passover Seder plate the next year. Hearlson said the memory of Easter at TBH-BE makes him emotional. ""I can't tell you how theologically capacious and generous that idea is,"" he said. Interfaith work on the Main Line, Hearlson added, has long followed a ""live and let live"" belief. ""This was something more,"" he said. ""We're going to actively support each other. We're going to be in each other's lives."" 'Living your values' in a divided world Though OPC's sanctuary remains under construction, its offices have since been rebuilt. The church can now hold Bible study and meetings in its own space, a relief after nearly two years of displacement. Yet Hearlson said he and his congregants ""feel a loss."" When asked what it means to practice interfaith collaboration in a moment of rising antisemitism, Witkovsky was pensive. Some of it is deeply profound, he said, like exchanging texts from each other's traditions. Other things are simpler, like sharing the leftovers from a catered lunch. ""In this world of difference ... "" he said. ""Just having people whose faces you know, it's super important. It's just an easy way to live your values."" When OPC's building is complete, Witkovsky joked to Hearlson that he's ""having staff meetings there"" after all of the Bible studies hosted in the synagogue. Hearlson quipped back with a smile, ""We'll order Hymie's."" Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup. Error! There was an error processing your request.

US House votes to release the Epstein files,"The Senate unanimously approved a bill to release the Epstein files on Tuesday night, paving the way for the publication of thousands of documents once President Trump signs the measure into law. The upper chamber of Congress swiftly agreed to pass the measure by unanimous consent — meaning no vote was required — hours after the House voted by 427 to 1 to approve the bill. Trump was not expected to sign the bill into law until Wednesday at the earliest. If he did veto the bill, it could be overridden only with a two-thirds vote in the Senate. Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House and a close Trump ally, had demanded that Republicans in the Senate make amendments to the bill first. Johnson said he harboured “deep concerns” about it, including its ability to protect the identity of Epstein’s victims. • Sign up for The Times’s weekly US newsletter Trump has previously committed himself to approving the release of evidence from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s inquiry into the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who took his own life in 2019. “We’ll give them everything,” Trump said on Monday. However on Tuesday, he repeated his previous claims that the issue had become a “Democrat hoax”. Posting on Truth Social before the Senate vote, Trump said he hoped the files would not distract Republicans from “all of the Victories that we’ve had”. Trump promised to release the files during the election campaign but Republicans have since spent months manoeuvring to avoid a vote. The president reversed his position again on Sunday after significant pressure from a small group of Republicans, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former Maga loyalist. Clay Higgins, a Republican congressman from Louisiana, cast the lone vote against releasing the files. Like Johnson, he expressed concerns about the privacy of victims and those named but not criminally implicated in Epstein’s crimes. Higgins argued that the House oversight committee, which is conducting its own investigation, be allowed to continue its work and release evidence when appropriate. “As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people — witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc. If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt,” Higgins wrote on X. • Marjorie Taylor Greene: Americans won’t tolerate Trump’s Epstein files bullshit Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman and co-sponsor of the bill to release the files, said fears about victims’ privacy were misplaced. “That’s been a red herring all along. The survivors have always been in favour of this legislation. And there’s a provision in there you could read … that protects them,” he said. Massie also referenced Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor being stripped of his royal titles in the UK, telling reporters: “There’s becoming a reckoning in Britain that needs to happen in the United States: a prince lost his title, the ambassador to the United States lost his job. We need to see those same kind of consequences here.” Speaking alongside Massie, the Democrat politician Ro Khanna insisted that Andrew needed “to come and testify at our oversight committee” after the disgraced royal was asked to appear before Congress for questioning over his links to Epstein. However, he showed no desire to reconcile with Taylor Greene, who he labelled a “traitor” and “disgrace”. Trump also reacted furiously when asked in the Oval Office why, if he supported the release of the files, he would not simply authorise their publication himself. • ‘Quiet, piggy’, Trump tells reporter who asked about Epstein files Referring to the journalist from ABC, the US news outlet, as a “terrible person and a terrible reporter,” Trump said: “I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. I threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert and I guess I turned out to be right.”",2025-11-18 20:08:00,The Times,positive,0.8358,11,Against_Donald_Trump," President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law on Wednesday at the earliest .

Why California’s shifting population trends require a new ‘social contract’,"California has a shortage of young people who are needed to support the state’s aging population, USC Price School Professor Dowell Myers said at at a conference hosted by the Southern California Association of Governments. (Photo: Southern California Association of Governments) California has a shortage of young people who are needed to support the state’s aging population, an urgent problem that requires California to invest in education and enact policies that make life more affordable for young adults, USC Price School Professor Dowell Myers said in a speech this week. Myers, who spoke at a conference hosted by the Southern California Association of Governments, argued that a new social contract between generations is needed to address the state’s shifting demographic trends. Those include falling birth rates and lower migration that reduce the number of young people. Meanwhile, older residents age in place, creating a “top heavy” age imbalance that will be twice as heavy in 2030 as it was 20 years ago, Myers said. “Millennials are the most supremely important group right now because they’re in the key age where they do everything: They are the new workers, the new parents, the new taxpayers, the new voters, the new home buyers,” said Myers, who is Director of the USC Price School’s Population Dynamics Research Group. “We better treat them right or we’re all going to suffer.” Myers, who was the keynote address at SCAG’s Southern California Demographic Workshop, explained that social contracts outline how resources and services are exchanged between prime wage earners and members of less advantaged generations, typically elderly retirees or children requiring public investment in their nutrition and education. Population changes have forged a new demographic reality, one that requires the state to prioritize investing in children and retaining young adults, Myers argued. For example, California should ease housing development restrictions that were popularized in the 1980s when population was booming, Myers said. Previous projections estimated that California would cross 50 million people by 2036. Now, the latest estimates from the Department of Finance say the state will barely ever get to 40 million. Easing those development restrictions could alleviate the state’s housing shortage, which is driving young people to move out of state to places where housing is more affordable, he added. “We still have restrictions in place to beat away runaway growth of earlier decades. But now we have a shortage of young people and their scarcity means we shouldn’t neglect them,” Myers said. “Livability for young adults and children is critical to retaining them in California, because we really need these people for the future workforce and as taxpayers,” he added. Master of Urban Planning USC’s MUP degree trains students to improve the quality of life for urban residents and their communities worldwide. Young people are also needed to buy homes from older adults. However, California’s top heavy age structure creates a mismatch between the number of older adults who may soon want to sell their expensive homes and the number of young adults who can afford them. “Who is going to buy your house and what can they really afford?” Myers asked. “Every buyer needs a seller. Every seller needs a buyer. So it’s a partnership, actually, and we don’t treat it that way.” To do so, older people need to invest more in younger generations. Publicly funded child care to help working families, and increased opportunities for higher education will greatly help the younger generation. Older people also stand to benefit from that. Myers noted. “After all, younger people with higher levels of education can typically afford more expensive homes, and this is who we hope will be buying your house,” Myers said.

Tosca Theresa Pardini,"Birth: 1931 Death: 2025 Tosca Theresa Pardini, beloved mother, Nonna, great grandmother, and cherished friend, passed away peacefully on Sunday, November 16, surrounded by the love of her family. On a dark, cloudy day, as the Frank Sinatra song “Fly Me to the Moon” played softly, a single ray of sunshine broke through and gently touched her beautiful face as she took her final breath with her family by her side. She was born at home in San Francisco on May 7, 1931, and she carried the spirit of the city with her throughout her life. Tosca later made her home in Ross, California, where she built a life centered on family, tradition, and enduring love. Tosca met the love of her life, Sergio Pardini, and they were married on February 17, 1952, at Saints Peter and Paul Church in North Beach. For sixty one adventure filled years they were inseparable and shared a deep devotion that guided their lives together. Known for her warmth, elegance, and quiet strength, Tosca created a home where everyone felt welcome. She was deeply proud of her Italian heritage and the traditions she lovingly passed down. Her kindness and grace touched all who knew her. Tosca loved traveling the world with Sergio, and together they were wonderful dancers who brought joy to every room. She had a flair for style and delighted in dressing to impress, always adding beauty to the world around her. She was an exceptional cook, best known for her lasagna and her unforgettable lobster thermidor. She also had a natural gift for interior design and an eye for creating comfort and beauty wherever she went. Above all, she was a true class act whose presence made a lasting impression. Tosca is survived by her three children: Mario and his wife Theresa Pardini, Paul and his wife Laurie Pardini, and Laura and her husband Shawn Ferjanec. She cherished her role as Nonna and formed close and loving connections with each of her grandchildren: Jenna Bottom and her husband Jeff Bottom, Daniel and his wife Carlie Pardini, Kimberly and her husband Mike Horan, Lauren and her husband Nick Baldwin, and Courtney Pardini. Her legacy continues through her treasured great grandchildren: Kennedy and London Bottom, Elle, Liam, and Jaxson Pardini, Noah and Quinn Horan, and Shelby and Barrett Baldwin. Each of them brought her profound joy. Tosca leaves behind a family who adored her and who will forever hold her memory close to their hearts. Though she is no longer with us, her spirit will continue to guide and comfort those she loved so deeply. The Memorial Service is 11:30 a.m., Saturday, November 22, 2025 at Valley Memorial Park Cemetery Chapel, 650 Bugeia Lane, Novato.

Obituary: Jimmie Trevis,"Funeral homes often submit obituaries as a service to the families they are assisting. However, we will be happy to accept obituaries from family members pending proper verification of the death. Jimmie Trevis Jimmie Lee Trevis passed away peacefully Nov. 13, 2025, in Kennewick, Washington, at the age of 86. He was born Oct. 20, 1939, to Edward and Opal Trevis in Hollister, California, the second of five children. He attended White Swan High School, where he met the love of his life, Marilyn Ann, and they were married in November 1958. Jim served in the United States Navy as a radioman. Jim and Marilyn settled in The Dalles, Oregon, building a beautiful life together and raising their two sons, Rick and Tim. Jim worked for almost 40 years as a metallurgist at the aluminum plants. Jim took pride in his work, and will be remembered for his slogan, “Do your work cheerfully!” A motto he lived out himself. Jim was a good, kind man. He enjoyed the family, volunteering in his community, fishing with his son and grandson, camping with his family, working in his yard, playing cribbage with his good friend, Ray Chrisman, laughing with his daughter-in-law, working on a good puzzle, and enjoying time with his wife on their deck. He and Marilyn were married for 67 years, together for more than 70, and he loved her dearly until the very end. The two relocated to the Tri Cities, Washington, in 2022 to be closer to family, though their hearts and home will forever remain in The Dalles. Jim is survived by his loving wife of 67 years, Marilyn; his son and daughter-in-law, Tim and Tammie Trevis; his grandchildren Timmer (Alexis) Trevis and Hannah (Seth) Gorham; two great-grandchildren, Charlie and Colbie Gorham, one more on the way this spring; and many extended family members. He is preceded in death by his parents, and his oldest son, Richard Arthur Trevis. Jim took pride in his family, his work ethic, and his relationship with the Lord. He will be missed dearly, and is home with his Savior. A memorial will be held at a later date. Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language.

"Access, equity, and heart: The rural health care imperative","Susan Meyer, PA-C, Shields Valley Clinic, Livingston HealthCare Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more. If you value these stories, please consider subscribing. Each November, communities across the country recognize National Rural Health Day, a time to honor the strength and resilience of rural America — and to shine a light on the importance of accessible healthcare close to home. As I sit and write this in Wilsall, in the heart of the Shields Valley of Montana, the connection between community and health care is especially clear. For many residents, the nearest hospital is 45 minutes away, and specialized care may be even farther. Those distances mean that local access to care isn’t just a convenience — it’s a necessity. That’s where rural health clinics, such as the Livingston HealthCare Shields Valley Clinic, play a vital role. By providing primary and preventive care right here in the community, we make it easier for patients to take charge of their health. When care is closer to home, people are more likely to keep appointments, follow up after hospital visits, and seek treatment before minor issues become serious problems. Local access also supports better health outcomes. Regular screenings, chronic disease management, and ongoing wellness visits can prevent complications, reduce hospitalizations, and improve quality of life. In urgent situations, having trained healthcare professionals nearby can facilitate timely transfer to higher-level care, ensuring that critical interventions begin as quickly as possible. But the value of a rural health clinic goes beyond medicine. In small communities, healthcare is personal. We know our patients — their families, their work, and the unique challenges they face living in rural Montana. There is a trust that forms that connects the community with the clinic and, that trust, allows for open communication and truly individualized care. It also builds a sense of belonging that strengthens the community as a whole. Rural clinics are extremely valuable to a community’s overall health; they are places where patients are known, supported, and cared for close to home. Yet, these clinics face real challenges like staffing shortages, rising operational costs, and insurance reimbursement models that often fail to reflect the realities of low-volume, high-impact rural care. Despite those hurdles, rural healthcare teams continue to show up, driven by the belief that everyone deserves quality care, no matter where they live. On National Rural Health Day on Nov. 20, I hope we can all come together to understand the importance of these small, but powerful facilities. Policymakers, healthcare systems, and communities must continue supporting rural clinics like the Livingston Healthcare Shields Valley Clinic. Every rural clinic that closes leaves a gap measured not just in miles, but in missed opportunities for prevention, safety, and connection. As we celebrate the strength and spirit of rural Montana, let’s also commit to strengthening the healthcare systems that sustain it. By supporting local clinics, we ensure that no one has to choose between their health and their zip code. In rural Montana, care isn’t just about medicine — it’s about relationships, trust, and connection. Let’s keep rural healthcare strong, reliable, and resilient — just like the people it serves.

Login or signup to continue reading Cooper Williams has been called into the Australia under 16s rugby union team, having had a breakout season with NSW Waratahs, that featured in the grand final win over Queensland in the Super Rugby U16 championship. But he's also starred in the 13-man code, having worn the black and white of the Western Suburbs Magpies in the Harold Matthews Cup. The Year 11 St Stanislaus' College student from Canowindra said he was in ""disbelief"" when he found out it was called into the national side. ""I was shocked, I just couldn't believe it,"" the Canowindra Pythons junior said. ""I've always dreamed about it, making really high rep sides and stuff. But this, I'm so grateful for people around me, like my family. ""It's just a great moment for me.

""There's so much disbelief, for out of the 1000s and 1000s of boys that play football and rugby union in Australia, I'm one of the 25 boys to make the side. Williams, who now plays open-side flanker, said he first played rugby for the Pythons when he was seven, but after a four-year break, he returned to the 15-man code in under 11s. ""I just couldn't stop playing it from there,"" he said. ""I just kept wanting to play more football. I've been enjoying it so much."" Since coming to Stannies in year 8, Williams started playing for his school. ""My first game was against Barker in a trial match. It was a big difference to what I was used to,"" he said. ""But I still enjoyed it. I was playing number 8 and I just enjoyed the culture around Stannies rugby."" Williams will head to Tweed Heads on December, where he'll participate in a training camp, before he'll play Queensland under 17s on December 13. ""It'll mean a lot to play for Australia,"" he said. ""I'm so grateful to be in such a good position with my football. The coaches that I've had and they've just taught me so much.

Who is guilty? – The anatomy of resignation culture,"Ümit KartoğluIn one country, a train derails, killing dozens. In another, a mine collapses, burying hundreds beneath the earth. The same question echoes across both tragedies: Who is responsible?This question does more than assign blame — it reveals the moral backbone of a society. The way a nation answers it tells us how it understands accountability, conscience, and power. In one place, the answer is short: “I am.” In another, it grows long and twisted: “It has nothing to do with me, but necessary steps will be taken.” Between those two sentences lies the story of how differently nations define responsibility.THE THREE FACES OF RESPONSIBILITYIn public administration, responsibility has three dimensions: criminal responsibility, political responsibility, and moral accountability.The first belongs to the realm of law — determining who violated a rule, who neglected a duty. Guilt is individual, so is punishment. The second belongs to the realm of public conscience — not who broke the law, but who betrayed public trust. The third lies outside both the judiciary and politics; it is a sphere governed by society’s moral norms.Even if a person has not directly committed a crime, they are expected to assume political responsibility if negligence, injustice, harm, or wrongdoing has occurred within their sphere of authority. Such a resignation is a political acknowledgement of failure and a step that opens the way for a proper investigation of subordinate staff. When the top official refuses to resign, it signals that they are protecting the faulty structure beneath them; in that case, the criminal process should evolve into a prosecution that includes them as well. Resignation means that the leader dissociates themselves from the wrongdoing and the wrongdoers. Mature democracies understand this distinction; others prefer to search for culprits rather than accept responsibility.Moral responsibility, on the other hand, is a duty recognized by society’s conscience, beyond law and politics. Political responsibility often brings moral responsibility with it. Moral responsibility also comes into play in developed democracies when consumers boycott products whose production involves child labor, forced labor, or animal cruelty.THE QUITE DIGNITY OF ACCOUNTABILITYIn Greece in 2023, two trains collided near Tempi, killing fifty-seven people. In the aftermath, Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis announced his resignation after returning from his visit to the site of the train accident at Tempi, adding in his statement that ""the pain cannot be worded sufficiently.""His resignation was not an admission of crime but an affirmation of honor. It is an act of purification — the acknowledgment that something went wrong under one’s watch, and that public trust must be restored not through excuses but through humility. When he resigned, the system remained standing precisely because someone had the decency to bow and leave.In his resignation statement, Karamanlis said, “I have just returned from the scene of the railway tragedy in Tempi. The pain is unspeakable.”“It is a fact that we received the Greek railway in a state that does not suit the 21st century. In these 3.5 years, we made every effort to improve this reality. Unfortunately, these efforts were not enough to prevent such an accident. And this is very heavy for all of us and for me personally.“When something so tragic happens, it is not possible to carry on as if it didn’t happen. I have been in politics for a few years, but I consider it a necessary element of our democracy that the citizens of our country trust the political system. This is called political responsibility.“For this reason, I am resigning from the position of Minister of Infrastructure and Transport. It is what I feel my duty to do as a minimal sign of respect to the memory of the people who left so unjustly and to take responsibility for the timeless mistakes of the Greek state and political system.“From the bottom of my heart, I once again express my pain and support to the families of the victims.”Greek Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned following the train crash tragedyIt was one of the clearest expressions of moral accountability in European politics. Karamanlis was not personally to blame, nor was he under legal pressure. Yet he understood that the system’s failure carried an ethical burden he could not ignore. His resignation was not an escape, but a declaration that leadership and morality cannot be separated. In Greece, his act was seen not as political weakness but as public maturity — proof that a state can still feel shame and turn it into dignity.THE POLITICS OF EVASIONIn Türkiye, the picture is almost the reverse. When a tragedy occurs, the reflex is predictable: “Those responsible will be punished.” The subtext is always the same: “But I am not among them.”After the 2018 Çorlu train massacre, the families of the victims called for broader accountability. Mısra Öz — whose husband and nine-year-old son died in the crash — became the most visible face of this pursuit of justice. She was later prosecuted on charges of insulting state officials and was fined 8,840 lira (about $1,250 at the time). Öz had described the court panel as “a panel that prefers to play the three monkeys.” The fine was later overturned by the Court of Cassation.The train disaster in Çorlu district of Tekirdağ, which claimed 24 lives and injured 341 peopleTransport Minister Cahit Turhan accepted neither political nor moral responsibility. Following an internal investigation, he stated that it had been concluded that Turkish State Railways or its personnel were “not responsible or at fault.” On the contrary, thirteen Turkish State Railways officials were put on trial for “causing death and injury by negligence.” Four were acquitted after a six-year-long trial, while others were sentenced to a total of 108 years in prison.In Türkiye, criminal responsibility trickles down the hierarchy, while political accountability evaporates before it reaches the top. Ministers often defend themselves by saying, “My signature isn’t on it,” as if responsibility were a matter of paperwork rather than oversight. The question of conscience is replaced by the ritual of denial. When journalists ask, “Will you resign?” the answer rarely changes: “I will continue to serve my nation.” And thus, the chain of accountability breaks at its highest link.THE SOYLU EPISODEThe only instance in recent Turkish politics where a minister openly assumed political responsibility came in April 2020, when Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu offered his resignation after chaos erupted during a hastily announced COVID-19 lockdown.“I take full responsibility for this mistake,” he declared — a rare moment of moral clarity in Turkish public life. For a brief instant, the country seemed stunned; it was as if the spirit of the resigned Greek minister had momentarily drifted through Ankara. Yet the next day, the Presidency announced that “Mr. Soylu’s resignation has not been accepted.”As Soylu himself explained when he resigned, the decision had been made in line with the President’s instructions. And just like that, conscience yielded to protocol. What had begun as a moral gesture was transformed into an act requiring political authorization — as if responsibility itself had been nationalized. The episode inevitably left many wondering whether Soylu’s resignation had ever been anything more than a carefully staged performance.THE AUTHORITARIAN REFLEX: WHEN RESIGNATION IS FORBIDDENIn democratic systems, resignation is one of the few remaining acts of personal agency — a leader’s way of saying, “I answer to the public, not just to power.” In heavily centralized systems, however, even this act is absorbed by hierarchy.The acceptance or rejection of a resignation becomes a test of loyalty. When a resignation is refused, it sends a clear message: it is not your conscience that matters, but your obedience. In such regimes, errors are never admitted because errors imply fallibility, and fallibility threatens authority. The state cannot apologize because the state must always appear infallible.Thus, the refusal of resignation — the denial of responsibility — becomes the most silent yet telling sign of authoritarianism. It is the moment when a state loses not its control, but its capacity for shame.WHEN THE RAIL BREAKSCriminal responsibility belongs to the courts; political and moral accountability belongs to the conscience of governance. In one country, the state apologizes; in the other, it explains. In one, a minister’s departure rebuilds trust; in the other, his staying corrodes it. Trains may derail everywhere, systems may falter anywhere — but what matters is what happens next. The tracks are repaired, and dignity is preserved. When authorities refuse responsibility — or when one does, and the resignation is rejected — in that quiet denial or refusal, a nation’s moral infrastructure collapses far more deeply than its rails ever could. In one country, a train derails, killing dozens. In another, a mine collapses, burying hundreds beneath the earth.

Mısra Öz — whose husband and nine-year-old son died in the crash — became the most visible face of this pursuit of justice. She was later prosecuted on charges of insulting state officials and was fined 8,840 lira (about $1,250 at the time). Öz had described the court panel as “a panel that prefers to play the three monkeys.” The fine was later overturned by the Court of Cassation.The train disaster in Çorlu district of Tekirdağ, which claimed 24 lives and injured 341 peopleTransport Minister Cahit Turhan accepted neither political nor moral responsibility. Following an internal investigation, he stated that it had been concluded that Turkish State Railways or its personnel were “not responsible or at fault.” On the contrary, thirteen Turkish State Railways officials were put on trial for “causing death and injury by negligence.” Four were acquitted after a six-year-long trial, while others were sentenced to a total of 108 years in prison.In Türkiye, criminal responsibility trickles down the hierarchy, while political accountability evaporates before it reaches the top. Ministers often defend themselves by saying, “My signature isn’t on it,” as if responsibility were a matter of paperwork rather than oversight. The question of conscience is replaced by the ritual of denial. When journalists ask, “Will you resign?” the answer rarely changes: “I will continue to serve my nation.” And thus, the chain of accountability breaks at its highest link.THE SOYLU EPISODEThe only instance in recent Turkish politics where a minister openly assumed political responsibility came in April 2020, when Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu offered his resignation after chaos erupted during a hastily announced COVID-19 lockdown.“I take full responsibility for this mistake,” he declared — a rare moment of moral clarity in Turkish public life. For a brief instant, the country seemed stunned; it was as if the spirit of the resigned Greek minister had momentarily drifted through Ankara. Yet the next day, the Presidency announced that “Mr. Soylu’s resignation has not been accepted.”As Soylu himself explained when he resigned, the decision had been made in line with the President’s instructions. And just like that, conscience yielded to protocol. What had begun as a moral gesture was transformed into an act requiring political authorization — as if responsibility itself had been nationalized. The episode inevitably left many wondering whether Soylu’s resignation had ever been anything more than a carefully staged performance.THE AUTHORITARIAN REFLEX: WHEN RESIGNATION IS FORBIDDENIn democratic systems, resignation is one of the few remaining acts of personal agency — a leader’s way of saying, “I answer to the public, not just to power.” In heavily centralized systems, however, even this act is absorbed by hierarchy.The acceptance or rejection of a resignation becomes a test of loyalty. When a resignation is refused, it sends a clear message: it is not your conscience that matters, but your obedience. In such regimes, errors are never admitted because errors imply fallibility, and fallibility threatens authority. The state cannot apologize because the state must always appear infallible.Thus, the refusal of resignation — the denial of responsibility — becomes the most silent yet telling sign of authoritarianism. It is the moment when a state loses not its control, but its capacity for shame.WHEN THE RAIL BREAKSCriminal responsibility belongs to the courts; political and moral accountability belongs to the conscience of governance. In one country, the state apologizes; in the other, it explains. In one, a minister’s departure rebuilds trust; in the other, his staying corrodes it. Trains may derail everywhere, systems may falter anywhere — but what matters is what happens next. The tracks are repaired, and dignity is preserved. When authorities refuse responsibility — or when one does, and the resignation is rejected — in that quiet denial or refusal, a nation’s moral infrastructure collapses far more deeply than its rails ever could. Even if a person has not directly committed a crime, they are expected to assume political responsibility if negligence, injustice, harm, or wrongdoing has occurred within their sphere of authority. Such a resignation is a political acknowledgement of failure and a step that opens the way for a proper investigation of subordinate staff. When the top official refuses to resign, it signals that they are protecting the faulty structure beneath them; in that case, the criminal process should evolve into a prosecution that includes them as well. Resignation means that the leader dissociates themselves from the wrongdoing and the wrongdoers. Mature democracies understand this distinction; others prefer to search for culprits rather than accept responsibility.Moral responsibility, on the other hand, is a duty recognized by society’s conscience, beyond law and politics. Political responsibility often brings moral responsibility with it. Moral responsibility also comes into play in developed democracies when consumers boycott products whose production involves child labor, forced labor, or animal cruelty.THE QUITE DIGNITY OF ACCOUNTABILITYIn Greece in 2023, two trains collided near Tempi, killing fifty-seven people. In the aftermath, Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis announced his resignation after returning from his visit to the site of the train accident at Tempi, adding in his statement that ""the pain cannot be worded sufficiently.""His resignation was not an admission of crime but an affirmation of honor. It is an act of purification — the acknowledgment that something went wrong under one’s watch, and that public trust must be restored not through excuses but through humility. When he resigned, the system remained standing precisely because someone had the decency to bow and leave.In his resignation statement, Karamanlis said, “I have just returned from the scene of the railway tragedy in Tempi. The pain is unspeakable.”“It is a fact that we received the Greek railway in a state that does not suit the 21st century. In these 3.5 years, we made every effort to improve this reality. Unfortunately, these efforts were not enough to prevent such an accident. And this is very heavy for all of us and for me personally.“When something so tragic happens, it is not possible to carry on as if it didn’t happen. I have been in politics for a few years, but I consider it a necessary element of our democracy that the citizens of our country trust the political system. This is called political responsibility.“For this reason, I am resigning from the position of Minister of Infrastructure and Transport. It is what I feel my duty to do as a minimal sign of respect to the memory of the people who left so unjustly and to take responsibility for the timeless mistakes of the Greek state and political system.“From the bottom of my heart, I once again express my pain and support to the families of the victims.”Greek Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned following the train crash tragedyIt was one of the clearest expressions of moral accountability in European politics. Karamanlis was not personally to blame, nor was he under legal pressure. Yet he understood that the system’s failure carried an ethical burden he could not ignore.

When authorities refuse responsibility — or when one does, and the resignation is rejected — in that quiet denial or refusal, a nation’s moral infrastructure collapses far more deeply than its rails ever could. “It is a fact that we received the Greek railway in a state that does not suit the 21st century. In these 3.5 years, we made every effort to improve this reality. Unfortunately, these efforts were not enough to prevent such an accident. And this is very heavy for all of us and for me personally.“When something so tragic happens, it is not possible to carry on as if it didn’t happen. I have been in politics for a few years, but I consider it a necessary element of our democracy that the citizens of our country trust the political system. This is called political responsibility.“For this reason, I am resigning from the position of Minister of Infrastructure and Transport. It is what I feel my duty to do as a minimal sign of respect to the memory of the people who left so unjustly and to take responsibility for the timeless mistakes of the Greek state and political system.“From the bottom of my heart, I once again express my pain and support to the families of the victims.”Greek Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned following the train crash tragedyIt was one of the clearest expressions of moral accountability in European politics. Karamanlis was not personally to blame, nor was he under legal pressure. Yet he understood that the system’s failure carried an ethical burden he could not ignore. His resignation was not an escape, but a declaration that leadership and morality cannot be separated. In Greece, his act was seen not as political weakness but as public maturity — proof that a state can still feel shame and turn it into dignity.THE POLITICS OF EVASIONIn Türkiye, the picture is almost the reverse. When a tragedy occurs, the reflex is predictable: “Those responsible will be punished.” The subtext is always the same: “But I am not among them.”After the 2018 Çorlu train massacre, the families of the victims called for broader accountability. Mısra Öz — whose husband and nine-year-old son died in the crash — became the most visible face of this pursuit of justice. She was later prosecuted on charges of insulting state officials and was fined 8,840 lira (about $1,250 at the time). Öz had described the court panel as “a panel that prefers to play the three monkeys.” The fine was later overturned by the Court of Cassation.The train disaster in Çorlu district of Tekirdağ, which claimed 24 lives and injured 341 peopleTransport Minister Cahit Turhan accepted neither political nor moral responsibility. Following an internal investigation, he stated that it had been concluded that Turkish State Railways or its personnel were “not responsible or at fault.” On the contrary, thirteen Turkish State Railways officials were put on trial for “causing death and injury by negligence.” Four were acquitted after a six-year-long trial, while others were sentenced to a total of 108 years in prison.In Türkiye, criminal responsibility trickles down the hierarchy, while political accountability evaporates before it reaches the top. Ministers often defend themselves by saying, “My signature isn’t on it,” as if responsibility were a matter of paperwork rather than oversight. The question of conscience is replaced by the ritual of denial. When journalists ask, “Will you resign?” the answer rarely changes: “I will continue to serve my nation.” And thus, the chain of accountability breaks at its highest link.THE SOYLU EPISODEThe only instance in recent Turkish politics where a minister openly assumed political responsibility came in April 2020, when Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu offered his resignation after chaos erupted during a hastily announced COVID-19 lockdown.“I take full responsibility for this mistake,” he declared — a rare moment of moral clarity in Turkish public life. For a brief instant, the country seemed stunned; it was as if the spirit of the resigned Greek minister had momentarily drifted through Ankara. Yet the next day, the Presidency announced that “Mr. Soylu’s resignation has not been accepted.”As Soylu himself explained when he resigned, the decision had been made in line with the President’s instructions. And just like that, conscience yielded to protocol. What had begun as a moral gesture was transformed into an act requiring political authorization — as if responsibility itself had been nationalized. The episode inevitably left many wondering whether Soylu’s resignation had ever been anything more than a carefully staged performance.THE AUTHORITARIAN REFLEX: WHEN RESIGNATION IS FORBIDDENIn democratic systems, resignation is one of the few remaining acts of personal agency — a leader’s way of saying, “I answer to the public, not just to power.” In heavily centralized systems, however, even this act is absorbed by hierarchy.The acceptance or rejection of a resignation becomes a test of loyalty. When a resignation is refused, it sends a clear message: it is not your conscience that matters, but your obedience. In such regimes, errors are never admitted because errors imply fallibility, and fallibility threatens authority. The state cannot apologize because the state must always appear infallible.Thus, the refusal of resignation — the denial of responsibility — becomes the most silent yet telling sign of authoritarianism. It is the moment when a state loses not its control, but its capacity for shame.WHEN THE RAIL BREAKSCriminal responsibility belongs to the courts; political and moral accountability belongs to the conscience of governance.

As Soylu himself explained when he resigned, the decision had been made in line with the President’s instructions. And just like that, conscience yielded to protocol. What had begun as a moral gesture was transformed into an act requiring political authorization — as if responsibility itself had been nationalized. The episode inevitably left many wondering whether Soylu’s resignation had ever been anything more than a carefully staged performance.THE AUTHORITARIAN REFLEX: WHEN RESIGNATION IS FORBIDDENIn democratic systems, resignation is one of the few remaining acts of personal agency — a leader’s way of saying, “I answer to the public, not just to power.” In heavily centralized systems, however, even this act is absorbed by hierarchy.The acceptance or rejection of a resignation becomes a test of loyalty. When a resignation is refused, it sends a clear message: it is not your conscience that matters, but your obedience. In such regimes, errors are never admitted because errors imply fallibility, and fallibility threatens authority. The state cannot apologize because the state must always appear infallible.Thus, the refusal of resignation — the denial of responsibility — becomes the most silent yet telling sign of authoritarianism.

Arsenal revive Champions League hopes with Real Madrid win,"Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images There was no disguising how much Renée Slegers needed this. After a flat derby draw and a bruising collapse in Munich, Arsenal entered their meeting with Real Madrid needing three points simply to keep their Champions League campaign alive. They got them through a second half that carried echoes of last season, and once again it was Alessia Russo who dragged the night in Arsenal’s favour. Arsenal’s problems have been obvious all month. Slegers admitted her side were in “a difficult period” after failing to break down Tottenham and falling eight points behind the top of the Women’s Super League. In Europe, surrendering a 2-0 lead at Bayern Munich left Arsenal on the brink. They could not afford another misstep. When Caroline Weir struck just before half-time, Arsenal looked on course for another costly night. They had controlled the ball without imposing themselves, a theme of their recent run, and were punished for their lack of incision. The anxiety around Meadow Park was familiar. But so was the response. Arsenal’s season turned on a second-half comeback against Madrid last year and the same pattern unfolded here. Back then, they overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit with a 3-0 win at the Emirates. This time the stakes were different, yet the rhythm was similar. Once again, Russo was the difference. After the break, Arsenal finally hit the pace the occasion demanded. Chloe Kelly’s delivery provided the equaliser, Russo steering a looping header into the far corner. Restored to her natural No 9 role after three matches spent deeper, her movement unsettled Madrid. Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images 13 minutes later, Beth Mead’s corner found Russo unmarked and she angled her header into the bottom right corner. Meadow Park shifted from relief to belief. Arsenal had the control they had lacked for weeks. Slegers recognised what it meant. “We really needed the three points to be able to at least go to the play-offs,” she said. “The points were more important than the performance today. We were 1-0 down at half-time but the way the players responded under pressure was such a high level. I’m really proud of the group.” Russo, who has made a habit of decisive European performances, reflected the mood. “It was a really important win tonight,” she said. “Tough conditions but our fans were amazing. They were with us through it all and it was really important that we won tonight and it was nice to score the goals as well.” She added: “We were really dominant in our second half performance, now we want to build on that going forward. Look, we can score all we want but if we’re not defensively solid, I don’t believe you win championships and you win tournaments. I think our backline and our back four were really solid tonight.” The backing of the crowd did not go unnoticed. “It was so nice,” Russo said. “Not an easy night to come out, it’s freezing and you’ve still got me here doing an interview. But it’s amazing to have their support. They’re so loud, they carry us through the tough moments. They’re really special.” Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images For Slegers, the performance was a return to something more recognisable. “In the first half, not so many chances created,” she said. “They get the set-piece, the free-kick. We set up a bad situation for ourselves where we gave away the free-kick and they scored from the second phase. Of course we’re not happy with that going into half-time, 1-0 down, but the players were really calm.” Arsenal’s plan for the second half was deliberate and direct. “We wanted to work with crosses today against Madrid,” Slegers said. “Alessia in the box is always so good. Not only in that final phase and the finishing, she scored two great goals for us today, but all the work that she does on the pitch.” Defensively, Arsenal were firmer than of late, limiting Madrid to scraps in open play. “You want to limit them to even less because I think they got out on us a couple of times in behind,” Slegers admitted. “Overall, you’re playing against a really good team. Their front four are really good players. I’m happy that from open play we didn’t concede a goal today.” The relief was palpable. “The players deserve it,” Slegers said. “It’s been a challenging block for us. We’re really happy that we finished it with a win. Every time we’ve had challenging times, they come back and they’ve done that today again. We’re really proud.” A win at home against FC Twente after the international break will likely secure a play-off place. Suddenly, the picture looks a little brighter.",2025-11-20 08:05:00,Yahoo!

"Disadvantaged neighborhoods face barriers to access cultural institutions, study finds","Less educated and lower income neighborhoods are consistently farther away from cultural institutions that can help advance one’s social mobility, according to a study co-authored by USC Price Professor Elizabeth Currid-Halkett. (Photo: iStock) Less educated and lower income neighborhoods are consistently farther away from cultural institutions – such as elite universities, museums, and theaters – that can help advance one’s social mobility, according to a new study from the USC Price School of Public Policy. What they researched: The study – published in the Journal of Economic Geography – is the first to quantify the geographic barriers that may reduce the number of lower-income and less educated households who consume the types of “cultural capital,” such as knowledge, skills and education, that enables greater social mobility. Master of Urban Planning USC’s MUP degree trains students to improve the quality of life for urban residents and their communities worldwide. What they found: Communities with high levels of education are systematically closer to all eight representative sources of cultural capital, compared to their counterpart communities, which was true for measurements of straight-line distances and expected travel times. Why it matters: “We’ve increasingly realized that our cultural capital can dictate future outcomes,” Currid-Halkett said. “If it’s one of the attributes that explains social mobility, then isn’t the simple policy solution to provide more access? Well, then you start to look at where cultural capital shows up in a place, and you realize it’s really physically and spatially out of reach for less educated and less well-off residents.” What can policymakers do? The study authors made several recommendations to close these access gaps, including: Go deeper: Currid-Halkett is the author of the book The Sum of Small Things: A Theory of the Aspirational Class, which uses the concept of cultural capital to explore how today’s elites deepen class divides.

Historic Knight-Tiger tilt for 2A state football title on deck tonight,"The Kendrick Tigers stand on the brink of extending a historic winning streak while the Logos Knights of Moscow will seek their program’s first-ever state title in an all-area Idaho Class 2A football playoff final set for 7 p.m. today at the P1FCU Kibbie Dome in Moscow. How we got here The favored and unbeaten Tigers (11-0) have played “lights out,” in the words of coach Ty Koepp, as they roared through their first two games of the state tournament by a combined score of 162-12. Most recently, they beat the fourth-seeded Grace Grizzlies 82-6 at the Dome last Friday in a game which saw the Tigers’ starters score every time they got the ball and build a 76-0 lead with a balanced passing and running offense before going to the bench in the third quarter. Koepp advises the public to expect more of the same in today’s final as his team seeks a fifth consecutive state title and second since moving up a size classification to 2A. “They know you’ve got to come out and play the game like (that) every week,” he said. “The boys are excited; they’re just ready to go out and play hard.” Meanwhile, to reach the title round for the first time since their program was founded six years ago, the third-seeded Knights (10-2) avenged a regular-season defeat with a 44-18 semifinal victory over second-seeded Kamiah. They thoroughly shut down the Kubs’ offense in the course of building a 44-0 lead during the first three quarters. “They have a history, and we don’t,” Logos coach Nick Holloway said of Kendrick. “We’re trying to ascend to the heights, as it were.” Logos is the only team to have beaten Kendrick in over four years — that coming in a 30-18 regular-season 2A Whitepine League upset last season before the Tigers struck back with a 52-26 victory in the state semifinals. Kendrick prevailed 48-24 in the teams’ league encounter this year, but not before trailing 16-14 at halftime in what was by far the most competitive contest of its 2025 campaign to date. Tigers on a tear For the young men of Kendrick, winning state titles has become second nature. The Tigers have finished their football postseason on top every year for almost as long as Logos has even had a team. At 20 years of age, former star Kendrick quarterback Koepp — who took the coaching reins this year after predecessor Zane Hobart accepted a job at Lewiston — remembers what it is like not to win State. He was on a lineup that lost in the semifinals his freshman year before leading Kendrick to titles in 2021, '22 and '23. In their 2024-25 school year, not only did the Tigers claim an almost unheard-of fourth consecutive football title and win out in their first year after moving up a size classification, but they performed another exceptionally rare feat by winning a triple crown: football, basketball and baseball state championships within a nine-month span. Many of the same core athletes led the way in all three campaigns, with names like Maddox Kirkland, Ralli Roetcisoender, Nathan Tweit and Cade Silflow recurring from roster to roster. All of this being the case, the advantages in big-game experience and confidence surely lie with the defending champions even more so than in a typical state final. Knights’ time to shine? Logos football started as a JV-only program in 2019, then debuted at the varsity level a year later with a 3-6 season. The Knights quickly climbed the ranks, reaching the 2A state semifinals the last two years before losing to eventual champions Butte County and Kendrick. Not only is Logos making its first ever appearance in a state football final, but it is doing so while fielding a mostly new group of varsity athletes, with nose guard Peter Story featuring as its lone returning starter from last year’s team while the likes of Baxter Covington and Joseph Sensing have spearheaded the offense. Holloway credits exceptional turnout (more than half the male student body of the school) and a culture of staying active year-round for keeping the Knights competitive even through major roster upheaval. “They’re staying in shape in the offseason if they aren’t playing a sport — but I think the biggest contributor is having parents, and especially dads, who are behind what we’re doing,” he said. “Part of a well-rounded life, and part of their Christian faith, is to push them physically. We’ve got boys who are doing a lot of stuff, and it really develops a good work ethic in them.” In addition to the outstanding buy-in from parents and student body, Holloway cites a strong coaching staff that adapts well to each year’s specific talent for the program’s continuity. Offensive coordinator John Michael Porras, O-line coach JC Christensen, special teams coach Ty Eisinger and assistants Joe Rigney, Derek Monjure, Darren Doane, George Landis and Jonathan Stromberg (a former UI football player) comprise the rest of the coaching lineup. This year’s Knights are a more run-heavy team than previous iterations led by standout passing quarterbacks Jack Driskill and Seamus Wilson, and have utilized that strength effectively. Holloway acknowledged that Kendrick is rightly considered the favorite, but said that the Knights could pull the upset if they avoid certain miscues and defensive lapses that cost them late in the teams’ last meeting and utilize their deep bench. “They’re the king of the mountain, and we want to take them down,” Holloway said. “We really do want to take them down. At the same time we have a lot of respect for them; the coaches there have always been class acts with us, and the players have been classy on the field. “They’ve got players on the team now that could be playing 6A, 5A, 4A, 3A here in Idaho.” Energy anticipated The location in their hometown of Moscow could be seen as working in favor of the Knights, who are known for their lively fan base. Holloway downplayed any such advantage, noting both that Kendrick’s own vibrant fan community travels well and that the conditions of the Dome are ideal for the Tigers’ more pass-heavy offense. “I expect the whole town of Kendrick to be up here; they’ll have a lot of fans as well,” he said. “Being a running team, I’d have wanted to play outside in the snow and the mud and rain. If I could order up snow and mud, I’d have done that, but we are playing in the Dome, so there you go.” The experienced Tigers have been to the Dome more than once in their careers, including last week, and they know what to expect. “You’ve got to play four quarters here, and that’s hard,” Kendrick’s Tanner Clemenhagen said after the Tigers’ win over Grace at the Dome last Friday. “All the boys say it was one of the loudest games they ever heard when it was Logos versus us (earlier this season), and in this place, it would be loud — but I love the energy.” Wendt may be contacted at (208) 848-2268, or cwendt@lmtribune.com.",2025-11-20 08:05:00,Dnews,positive,0.7773,25,Idaho_To_Maddox, Kendrick Tigers and Logos Knights meet in Idaho Class 2A football playoff final at 7 p.m. today .

Former aide pleads guilty in conspiracy to steal campaign funds from Xavier Becerra,"One of the accused conspirators in a California political corruption case involving the theft of campaign funds pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday in Sacramento. Sean McCluskie, the former chief of staff for former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud charge in connection with the theft of his longtime boss’ dormant campaign funds. McCluskie is at the center of what federal prosecutors argued was an enrichment scheme that also ensnared Dana Williamson, a former chief of staff to Gov. Gavin Newsom. McCluskie and a third co-conspirator, Sacramento lobbyist Greg Campbell, have signed plea agreements with federal prosecutors. | RELATED | Who are the people involved in the California political corruption case? According to an indictment, McCluskie approached Williamson, then a prominent political consultant, with a plan that could help him make more money. Williamson and Campbell are accused of helping him funnel funds from one of Becerra's dormant political campaign accounts in California. Campbell used his company as a conduit for the money, according to the indictment. The indictment says as part of the scheme, the money was transferred to at least three different companies, before payments were ultimately issued to McCluskie. The documents say the payments were disguised as work done by his wife, but she never worked for any of the companies. The indictment says when the scheme ended around September 2024, McCluskie had stolen about $225,000 of campaign funds for his own use. Part of his plea agreement requires McCluskie to pay back that money to Becerra's campaign. Court documents associated with McCluskie’s court appearance on Thursday were ordered sealed. Sentencing in McCluskie’s case is set for Feb. 26. McCluskie remained silent outside the courthouse after his hearing when asked questions by reporters. Here’s him walking out of court and staying silent as I peppered him with questions: Meanwhile, Williamson has pleaded not guilty to 23 counts in connection with the alleged campaign funds theft scheme and two other issues related to falsified business contracts having to do with a COVID-19-era loan, and for claiming luxury items as business expenses on her taxes.

2026 Las Vegas Raiders Draft Scouting: John Mateer,"Position: Quarterback Height: 6’1 Weight: 224 Stats: 2025 (9 games) – 64%, 2086 yards, 8 TD, 7 INT, 95 att, 424 yards, 7 TD Class/Age: RS Junior, 21 Team: Oklahoma I want to mention Mateer having 53 forced missed tackles in his 2024 season which was 4th in all of college football among every offensive player because it is fascinating. Mateer has an NFL caliber arm, and an above average one at that, he does a good job developing consistent touch and velocity on his pass attempts while also having the ability to complete pass attempts 45+ yards downfield. He shows the ability to put the ball in tight windows with good touch, exceptional anticipation and throws to make receivers open. Mateer generates his pass attempts out of a short quick release that allows him to throw out of multiple arm angles and generate turn on the ball. He’s strong in the pocket showing a good ability to step up and move around to avoid pressure while also utilize hitches and quick steps to make space for him to complete a pass. Matter shows the ability to work out of the pocket, keeping his eyes downfield and making a play while also having the knowledge to throw the ball away when necessary. Mateer is an exceptional runner with good footwork, strong burst and quickness along with true long speed at the position. He’s able to work as a scramble threat and a downfield designed running QB. Mateer shows toughness willing to take hits and isn’t afraid to complete passes through contact and pressure in the pocket. Notably, he came back from a wrist injury in 2 weeks after an estimated 6 week timeline though his play did fall off a touch. Mateer is young, he’s a little inexperienced at quarterback but has a knack for the position as well. There’s times Mateer can take an extra hitch or stare down defenders on certain routes which can lead to interceptions and plays on the ball. Additionally, he has a tendency at times to look off and look back quickly without giving the DB enough time to give up leverage. His footwork will require consistency and refinement along with the times Mateer makes a random off platform pass when not needed (though the pass attempts are generally highly successful). Mateer is tough but undersized for the position which could lead to him being a lower rated prospect than others. Mateer isn’t going to threaten a defense with his arm downfield fully but he does have the ability to create long passes though there’s usually some loft under them which could lead to a play on the ball by the backend DBs and make him a scheme specific quarterback. Mateer will need to learn to avoid contact in the NFL at times as he often fights for extra yards, which is a good trait but could cause injuries. Additionally, you would like to see him not hold onto the ball as often in the pocket and rely on his athletic ability to bail him out along with having some “im the guy” in his arm and causing an errant throw that isn’t safe with the football. Grade: 2.78 – Late 2nd Round Pro-Comp: Jaxson Dart Mateer is an athletic monster at quarterback, he’s a true threat to throw for 3000 yards in the NFL with another 850+ rushing yards. While he’ll never likely lead the NFL or be top 10 in passing yards he’s an effective quarterback who can be a threat to defenses with his legs and arm in the short and intermediate range. Mateer is smart and generates above average zip, velocity, and touch on pass attempts within 15 yards.

LaMalfa Votes to End Government Shutdown,"WASHINGTON D.C.—Congressman Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale) released the following statement after voting in favor of H.R. 5371, the Continuing Appropriations, Agriculture, Legislative Branch, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Extensions Act, 2026, to reopen the government after six weeks of closure. “After forty-three days, I was pleased to vote in favor of H.R. 5371 to end this unnecessary government shutdown,” said Rep. LaMalfa. “This shutdown was entirely avoidable. Senate Democrats refused to act on the House’s clean funding bill and instead chose to hold the government hostage for political leverage. Because of their political games, millions of people—including many in District 1—experienced a lapse in SNAP benefits, critical disaster payments and agricultural loans were stalled, prescribed burns and hazardous forest fuels projects were delayed, and air travel spun into chaos. I appreciate our Congressional Leadership for getting the government back to work where we should’ve been all along. I’m looking forward to refocusing on the priorities that have sat in limbo over the last six weeks and resuming work on the issues that matter most to the people I represent.” Background: H.R. 5371, the Continuing Appropriations, Agriculture, Legislative Branch, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Extensions Act, 2026, reopens the federal government and extends funding through January 30, 2026. The measure also includes three full-year appropriations bills covering Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Rural Development, and the Food and Drug Administration, and the Legislative Branch. H.R. 5371 ensures critical operations—such as veterans’ services, agricultural programs, SNAP benefits, and essential federal oversight—continue without interruption while Congress completes work on the remaining Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations bills through regular order. Approved Community Project Funding requests that benefit District 1 include: $22M for Beale Air Force Base to construct a new Mission Data Operations Center to support and enhance the base’s capabilities. $2.5M for Collins Pine Forest Health and Resiliency Partnership in Tehama County to reduce wildfire risk. $2M for the Durham Irrigation District 1.0 Million Gallon Water Storage Tank Project to provide the area with reliable, clean drinking water. $605,000 for the City of Willows to purchase a Type 1 Fire Engine to serve the local area. $256,150 for the Siskiyou Business Innovation and Community Resilience Center for structural upgrades and critical renovations. Other priorities in H.R. 5371: Waives the pay cap limitation for wildland fire personnel through January 30th. Provides an increase of $500,000 to the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) for the suppression of grasshoppers to prevent crop losses, an important issue in Modoc and Siskiyou counties. Includes a $250,000 funding increase for smoke exposure research, a larger priority for northern California winegrape growers. Includes $15M for the IR-4 program, which supports research into safe and effective specialty risk management tools to reduce pest and disease outbreaks. Extends the Farm Bill for one full calendar year, along with the Grain Standards Act full extension, to ensure continuity of critical farm safety net programs that help our farmers, ranchers, and dairy producers manage risk and grow the food we all eat. Closes the hemp loophole that has resulted in the proliferation of unregulated intoxicating, synthetic hemp products, including Delta-8 and hemp flower, being sold online and in gas stations across the country. Provides full funding of $107.4B for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and $8.2B to the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) beneficiary payments. Reimburses states for certain expenses and benefits incurred during the shutdown that would otherwise have been covered by Federal funding. Partly cloudy. Low 44F. Winds N at 5 to 10 mph..

Dolphins embrace postseason hopes,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- The Miami Dolphins are delusional. And that's by their own definition. They're entering their bye week at 4-7, five losses behind AFC East leader New England in the division race, 2 1/2 games behind Jacksonville for what would be the final wild-card spot in the conference, and as a 50-1 long shot just to make the playoffs, according to BetMGM Sportsbook. In other words, they're not exactly in a great spot. One would have to be, well, delusional, to think that playoff hopes are realistic. But that's exactly the word that Dolphins linebacker Bradley Chubb used a couple of weeks ago, and it has stuck. ""If I had a dime for every time I was called 'delusional' ... it's right down my alley,"" Dolphins Coach Mike McDaniel said. It's not like the reasons for at least some hope aren't there. They've won back-to-back games for the first time all season. The schedule isn't exactly daunting over the next few weeks. They've dealt with a slew of injuries, including Tyreek Hill's dislocated knee. They've heard boos from fans. They've seen top pass rusher Jaelan Phillips get traded away. They've seen banner planes circling the stadium calling for drastic change; one such move ended up happening when the team parted ways with General Manager Chris Grier. A lot has happened. Much of it has been bad. The Dolphins still believe anyway. ""We just stayed together in the hard times,"" Chubb said this week before the team scattered for a few bye-week days off. ""We made it -- what's the word I'm looking for? -- we made it a thing to get together, to make sure we stuck together, eat together, whatever we can do to bond. I feel like that's been the biggest thing, guys trusting in one another."" History says they could have packed it in without much in the way of repercussions. Teams that get off to the sort of starts that Miami did this season almost always wind up missing the playoffs, and the odds are still overwhelming that this Dolphins team will do the same. The Dolphins were 1-6. Only two teams in NFL history have started 1-6 or worse and made the playoffs, and the last time it happened was 1970. The Dolphins were 2-7. The only team that made the playoffs after such a start was Washington in 2020, a season when its 7-9 record was good enough to win the NFC East. The Dolphins are 4-7. Those playoff odds are a tiny bit better now, given than 10 teams that started 4-7 or worse have made the postseason and three of them (Washington 2020, Jacksonville 2022 and Tampa Bay 2023) have gotten there in the five seasons preceding this one. But here's where the hope comes into play. Running back De'Von Achane enters this week third in rushing yards and fourth in scrimmage yards across the NFL. Linebacker Jordyn Brooks leads the NFL in tackles. The defense has picked up considerably over the last four games. ""We just want to hold onto that, hold onto that and continue to get better,"" Brooks said. ""See where we as players can get better individually and see if we can't keep it rolling."" After beating Washington this past weekend in Madrid, Miami quarterback Tua Tagovailoa -- in a sentiment echoed by others -- said he doesn't think the bye week will disrupt how the Dolphins seem to have figured out what works best for them. ""I think a lot of the guys on the team would love to continue playing given the momentum that we have, the momentum that we've built collectively in all three phases, but it is what it is,"" Tagovailoa said. ""We're going to go through our bye week, but that's not without talking about how we can continue to stay on that momentum train following the next game week."" The Dolphins will almost certainly be the favorite when they return to game again on Nov. 30 at home against New Orleans. After that, Miami heads on the road to open December at the New York Jets -- another game in which the Dolphins should be favored. Win both of those, and that would mean the record is 6-7. It guarantees nothing and is hardly aspirational -- no team comes into a season hoping to be 6-7 after 13 games -- but it would surely mean that the delusions might not seem so delusional anymore. ""I'm just very impressed, but not surprised,"" McDaniel said. ""It matches a belief that I've had the entire time with these guys that they are made of the right material that it takes to succeed in this league. A lot more often than not, you have to succeed on the heels of failure. That's just the way that this league is. ""The opportunity that is a down moment in your season or a down period, that is a supreme opportunity to show people who you really are and I think our guys have responded in kind.""",2025-11-21 08:05:00,Nwaonline,negative,0.7034,0,Loss_After_Career," Miami Dolphins are 4-7, five losses behind AFC East leader New England in division race .

Tech CEO Says Last-Minute Salary Negotiations Cost Candidate 2 Job Offers: ‘Can’t Build A Career With Bargaining Skills’,"A recent hiring story shared by tech founder Gaurav Kheterpal, CEO of Vanshiv Technologies, has ignited fresh debate around work ethics and last-minute salary demands. According to Kheterpal, a candidate who was about to join his team reached out just days before the start date, requesting a salary match to an offer nearly Rs 2 lakh higher from another company. Kheterpal said his team stood firm, informing the candidate that he could either join at the originally agreed pay or have the offer withdrawn. The candidate chose the other company, but the situation took an unexpected turn when the founder of that company contacted Kheterpal. It turned out the candidate had shown them the initial offer letter and asked for an even higher salary. Frustrated by the repeated bargaining, both founders decided to withdraw their offers. The candidate then attempted to return to Kheterpal’s company, but the offer was no longer available. Candidate Asked For Higher Pay Just Before Joining Taking to X (Formerly Twitter), Gaurav Kheterpal wrote, “A candidate was supposed to join us on Monday. He emailed us yesterday asking us to match the offer of the other company, which was higher by almost 2 Lakhs. We responded to him immediately that we can’t do that, and if he’s not interested, we’ll withdraw our offer. If he wants to join based on our original offer, we’re looking forward to having him on board. He responded, ‘I will join the other company,’ and we withdrew our offer. Apparently, he played the same trick at the other company, showing our offer letter and asking them to bump it up."" “Coincidentally, I know the founder of that company, and since he showed our offer letter to them, they reached out to us. We told them, ‘We’re not hiring him. If they want, they can.’ They too got fed up with his constant negotiations and rescinded his offer. The candidate has now reached out to us to onboard him based on our original offer. Only if such candidates realised that they can always get a ‘job’ which pays them more, but they can’t build a ‘career’ with such bargaining skills,"" the founder added.

So are we workers. However hard we work, we will never be the owner, so stop this condescending tone. And yes, you did a cheap act by contacting another company. Only shows how small your enterprise is and how much extra time you have."" Another shared, “People calling this ‘fair negotiation’ are completely wrong here. What if a company gave you an offer and then, after a week, came back saying, ‘We have another candidate ready to join at 2 lakh less, so let us know if you’d like to match the revised salary and join us.’ Would you call that fair?"" “Offer letters are confidential. No two companies would call each other to compare a candidate’s offer; that’s a breach of hiring ethics,"" a comment read. An individual stated, “I dislike people signing on and then walking away. It’s unprofessional, but it’s one of those ‘samay samay ki baat hai’ type things. When it’s an employer’s market, they screw around with candidates in a zillion ways. And when it’s a candidate’s market, this is what it looks like. Over a longer horizon, it all evens out. For both sides."" Another mentioned, “People don’t realise that chasing a slightly higher offer can cost them long-term credibility. A career is built on trust and consistency, not constant last-minute negotiations."" Why Just Candidates Are Branded ‘Unprofessional’ Swipe Left For Next Video Meanwhile, one of them shared a story about their friend who faced a difficult situation after being selected by a popular startup. The company initially promised a salary of Rs 22 lakh per year, prompting him to confidently resign from his previous job. However, when the final offer arrived, the salary was unexpectedly reduced to Rs 19 lakh. Having already completed his notice period, he had no option but to return to his old job, and the HR team insisted that Rs 19 lakh was the best they could offer. The person shared this example to highlight the double standards in how companies and candidates are treated. When a company withdraws an offer, it’s often seen as a business decision. When a company reduces an agreed salary, it’s explained as a budget constraint.

UK drivers can dodge yellow box junction fines on 1 occasion,"There are numerous rules that many drivers might not be familiar with, from road signs to important checks to do in winter to stay safe. Now if you have a motoring test looming, how do you feel about a box junction? A box junction is criss-cross yellow lines painted on the road, designed to prevent cars from obstructing a route. The Highway Code stipulates you can face a fine if you're halted inside a box for too long, but sometimes it's unavoidable. Now, one expert has revealed the single circumstance when you can get away with ending up inside the grid in a post on TikTok. Annie, a theory test specialist, provided a clear explanation with a 'simple' demonstration video. She stated: ""Do you get confused with the rules of box junctions? They are really easy to understand, let me explain them to you. ""So if you were in this green car and you wanted to turn left, and the exit road was blocked and the road you're going into is blocked with cars, you wouldn't go would you, you'd wait here. ""If you were going straight ahead and there's a row of cars here, you wouldn't go and block the junction, you'd wait somewhere sensible. ""If you were going to turn right and your exit was blocked, the road you're going into is blocked, you wouldn't go, you'd wait somewhere sensible, it's the same in a box junction."" Annie then clarified if your exit road is blocked when the traffic lights turn green, you must stay behind the line. ""If you want to turn right, the exit road is blocked, you don't go you wait behind the line,"" she explained. However, the situation changes if there's an oncoming car. Annie elaborated: ""Now let's say the traffic light change to green. ""This car has gone and you've got this oncoming vehicle, your exit road is clear so you can go because all you're waiting for is this car to go past. ""You're not stuck, you're just waiting. This car will go past and you can go or the traffic lights will change and the cars will stop and you can go. So if your exit road is blocked don't go, if your exit road is clear you do go. ""Now when you're turning right, you sometimes have to wait for oncoming vehicles to go past, so the only time you wait in a box is when you're turning right and you're waiting for the oncoming vehicles to go past, does that now make sense?"" Since sharing her explanation, the post has received nearly 2,000 likes, with many praising Annie for her guidance.

Baseball returns to Japanese American detention camp after a historic ballfield is restored,"In the spring of 1942, 15-year-old Momo Nagano needed a way to fill her time. She was imprisoned at the Manzanar Relocation Center along with approximately 10,000 other people of Japanese ancestry. When she’d arrived with her mother and two brothers, she’d been horrified. The detention facility was located in the middle of the desert, about 225 miles northeast of Los Angeles. As I describe in my book “When Can We Go Back to America? Voices of Japanese American Incarceration during World War II,” barbed wire surrounded the perimeter and armed soldiers peered down from guard towers. The toilets and showers lacked partitions, and Nagano was forced to stand in long lines for hours in mess halls that served canned food. Her bed was a metal cot. She was directed to stuff straw into a bag for a makeshift mattress. She didn’t know whether she and her family would ever be able to return to their Los Angeles home. One day, the teenager decided to pick up a glove and play softball. Her son, Dan Kwong, told me in an interview that Nagano ended up playing catcher for The Gremlins, one of the camp’s many women’s softball teams. “In one game, a batter connected with the ball and then threw the bat, clocking my mom in the nose, breaking it,” he said. “But despite her injury, she still enjoyed playing, even though she didn’t think her team was very good.” Eighty years later, the descendants of prisoners – such as Nagano’s son, Kwong – are playing baseball again in Manzanar. Thanks to an effort spearheaded by Kwong, a baseball field on the site has been restored as a way to both celebrate the resiliency of so many prisoners and memorialize this dark period in U.S. history. After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. government wrongly assumed that Japanese-descended West Coast residents would be more loyal to Japan and presented an espionage risk. So on Feb. 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order that gave the U.S. Army the authority to forcibly remove all first-generation immigrants from Japan and their American-born descendants from their West Coast homes. In March 1942, U.S. soldiers began transporting the detainees to temporary detention sites under Army jurisdiction. The Manzanar site opened on March 21, 1942, and it eventually became one of 10 long-term detention centers, colloquially known as “the camps.” According to Duncan Ryȗken Williams, the director of The Irei Project, which has compiled the most comprehensive list of those detained, nearly 127,000 people of Japanese ancestry were incarcerated between 1942 and 1947, when the last camp closed. Two-thirds of them were American citizens. Most were imprisoned for the duration of the war, and all were held without hearings or charges leveled against them. Sixth-grade boys play softball during recess at the Manzanar Relocation Center on Feb. 10, 1943. Francis Leroy Stewart, courtesy of California State University Dominguez Hills Gerth Archives & Special Collections. Adjusting to their new grim reality, the detainees embraced the Japanese spirit of “gaman,” which means to endure hardship with dignity and resilience. They set up an education system and coordinated an array of activities. And they immediately organized baseball and softball games. Many Japanese American families had already developed a passion for the two sports. Horace Wilson, an educator from Maine, is credited with introducing baseball to Japan in the early 1870s. In 1872 the Yeddo Royal Japanese Troupe became the first Japanese people to play baseball on U.S. soil. When young Japanese men started immigrating to the U.S. in the late 19th century, they brought with them a love of America’s pastime. Kerry Yo Nakagawa, the director of the Nisei Baseball Research Project, has written about the vanguards of Japanese American baseball. At a time when players of color were excluded from Major League Baseball, talented Japanese American ballplayers such as Kenichi Zenimura formed teams that barnstormed the country. They even played alongside Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in an exhibition game in Fresno, Calif., on Oct. 29, 1927. Lou Gehrig, second from left, and Babe Ruth, third from right, pose with Japanese American ballplayers at an exhibition game. Kenichi Zenimura is third from left. Frank Kamiyama, courtesy of the family of Taizo Toshiyuki and the Nisei Baseball Research Project “Every pre-war Japanese American community had a baseball team and they brought their love of baseball with them to the assembly centers and their camps,” Nakagawa explained to me. Though Zenimura was forced to leave his Fresno home and go to a camp in Gila River, Arizona, he soon had a baseball diamond and a 32-team league up and running. At Manzanar, baseball was easily the most popular sport. According to Dave Goto, the Manzanar National Historic Site arborist, the camp had 10 baseball and softball diamonds on the grounds and more than 120 teams divided into 12 leagues. The camp newspaper, the Manzanar Free Press, provided detailed game recaps, and thousands turned out to watch the games at Manzanar’s “A” Field. “Watching baseball played at a semi-pro level was entertainment and also gave them a sense of normalcy and community,” Nakagawa said. The ManzaKnights were one of the 100-plus teams formed at the Manzanar camp. (Courtesy of the Maruki Family/Manzanar Historic Site.) But for those who felt their loyalty to the U.S. was unfairly questioned, baseball was also a powerful way to express their identity as Americans, especially for the U.S.-born children of Japanese immigrants. Takeo Suo, who was incarcerated at Manazarer, recalled, “Putting on a baseball uniform was like wearing the American flag.” Or, as Nakagawa put it, “What could be more American than playing the all-American pastime?” After the war was over and the camps closed, those who’d been imprisoned had to focus on rebuilding their lives. Many were unable to return to their prewar hometowns. For those who ended up back on the West Coast, baseball continued to play an important role. As Japanese American journalist and sports historian Chris Komai explained in a program at the Japanese American National Museum, “Baseball was a way for them to reestablish their communities while they dealt with antagonism and discrimination. Through the games they stayed connected with their friends and relatives who were now scattered.” Postwar community baseball gave rise to the Southern California Nisei Athletic Union Baseball Leagues and other leagues that still operate. Kwong began playing for the Nisei Athletic Union in 1971 and does so to this day. Nagano instilled in her son a commitment not only to baseball but also to social justice. A performance artist, Kwong stages a one-man play, “Return of the Samurai Centerfielder,” to shed light on this episode in history through the lens of playing baseball at Manzanar. Two years ago, he set out to restore the main Manzanar ball field and to bring baseball back to the site as a tribute to his late mother and other Manzanar detainees. Working with Goto, the site arborist, volunteer construction supervisor Chris Siddons, Manzanar archaeologist Jeff Burton and other Manzanar site staff, Kwong and his team have restored the field almost exactly as it was. They carefully scrutinized archival photos, some taken by famed landscape photographer Ansel Adams and others snapped by studio photographer Toyo Miyatake, who’d been imprisoned at Manzanar. Miyatake’s photos were provided by his grandson, Alan Miyatake. Organizers used archival materials – such as this 1943 Ansel Adams photograph of a baseball game at the Manzanar camp – to restore the field. (Ansel Adams/Library of Congress) From November 2023 to October 2024, volunteers cleared sagebrush, dug post holes and poured concrete, enduring intense heat, strong winds and relentless dust. On Oct. 26, 2024, baseball returned to Manzanar after more than 80 years before an invitation-only audience. In the inaugural game, Kwong’s Li’l Tokio Giants beat the Lodi JACL Templars. In the game that followed, players donned custom 1940s-style uniforms and used vintage baseball equipment lent by History For Hire prop house. Many of the players were descendants of Japanese Americans who’d been incarcerated at Manzanar and other camps. That day, Kwong was emotional as he said, “Mom would have gotten such a kick out of this.” Kwong’s team has completed an announcer’s booth in time for this year’s grand opening, a doubleheader open to the public. The games were originally scheduled for Oct. 18, 2025, but have been postponed due to the U.S. government shutdown. The new announcer’s booth under construction at the restored Manzanar ball field. Dan Kwong, CC BY-SA For Kwong, staging a historical reenactment of how detainees played ball behind barbed wire pays tribute to their resilience, connects camp survivors and descendants with their past, and allows them to share their story with the American public. He hopes the games can become an annual event, a recurring celebration. His motto: “In this place of sadness, injustice, and pain, we will do something joyous, righteous, and healing. We will play baseball.” Susan H.

The scent mirrors the campaign completely: it’s grown-up smelling but still playful and light and the floral notes feel modern and fresh.”—LAUREN BALSAMO, BEAUTY DIRECTOR Why we love it: Of everything in beauty editor Beth Gillette's (hi, me) overflowing fragrance collection, Thé Noir is the one she spritzes on the most. It's also the scent she tells everyone to try at least once, since it has a subdued scent that appeals to a lot of noses. A combo of fig and bergamot add a brightness to the top of the scent, but it's softened by woodsy notes, smokey tobacco, and musk. Cosmo editor's review: ""I go feral for fig notes in a perfume, so I'm not shocked that this spicy, black-tea fragrance is one of my top favorites from Le Labo. It's fresh and crisp, thanks to the bergamot and fig, but has a smooth, warm finish from musk and cedar. And ooooh, the tobacco note gives it a deep, smokier finish. I wear this when I wanna be wrapped up in a cozy cashmere blanket (or smell like I'm at the Edition—IYKYK).""—BETH GILLETTE, BEAUTY EDITOR Why we love it: Powdery perfumes tend to feel dated. Dusty, some might say. But Power Self is powdery in a clean, just-out-of-the-shower way. It's a different brand of sexy—one that's fresh and smooth. It mixes a bunch of floral notes with ambroxan and musk for a soapy finish. Cosmo editor's review: “This is simply epitome of a clean and fresh scent. When I spritz this on, I just feel like the most confident version of myself (hence the name). It's also slightly juicy and sweet, while still being genderless and not overly feminine. When I go on long trips and can only pack one scent, I always choose this one.”—JASMINE HYMAN, ASSISTANT BEAUTY EDITOR Why we love it: A gourmand perfume doesn't have to truly smell like something you could find in a bakery. Actually, the best ones to the Cosmo team don't. Which is why we're so obsessed with this layerable scent from Dedcool. It's undeniably sweet, but in a creamy, soft, delectable way that doesn't veer too cake-y. Cosmo editor's review: ""This is actually one of my most complimented perfumes. It gives me that Rihanna effect—everyone I cross paths with can't get enough of my scent.In fact, the first day I wore it, a cab driver immediately asked for the link so he could buy it for his sister.""—SAMANTHA OLSON, ASSISTANT NEWS EDITOR Why we love it: If you're familiar with Merit's understated makeup products, then you won't be surprised by this minimal scent. Although it's packed with floral notes and juicy pear and bergamot, it smells surprisingly clean. Herbaceous notes (aldehydes, orris, and musk) ground the fragrance for a refined overall profile. Cosmo editor review: ""You know when you finally find the perfect (but slightly expensive) white T shirt and you’re like: “holy shit this is worth every dollar—I’ll wear this all the time and a million different ways?” That’s Retrospect. It’s indulgent, but good for everyday and the clean, skin-like scent easy to wear, whether you’re a perfume novice or full-on nose.""—LAUREN BALSAMO, BEAUTY DIRECTOR Another Cosmo editor's review: ""I typically hate floral perfumes. Just look at this list—all of my #1 faves are firmly outside of the floral category. But Merit Retrospect is just different. It doesn't smell old or dated; instead, it's chic. I liken it to what I thought I'd smell like as a magazine editor when I dreamed of this job in the early '00s. Sure, the jasmine notes smell flowery, but without the usual powderiness.""—BG Why we love it: Of all the iconic perfumes we've sniffed, this tops our list for its overall likeability and noticeable scent. It's not a bad thing to smell like everyone else, so long as it's as good as this. To us, it's a fruity and delicate scent that smells nostalgic. READ COSMO'S FULL REVIEW. Cosmo editor's review: “At first spritz, it’s fresh and a little fruity without being cloying. Hours later, it settles into a warm, sensual vanilla with slight traces of floral. I’m pretty picky about vanilla perfumes (they can oftentimes veer too salty and skin-like for me), but here, the vanilla blends perfectly with the citruses and florals. I know some people may associate Chanel with older, powdery scents—like Chanel No. 5—but Mademoiselle feels ageless.”—JH Why we love it: Jazz Club didn't put the Maison Margiela Replica fragrance line on the map, per se, but it stands alone as one of their most iconic perfumes. It's packed with all the things you'd expect in a chic jazz club: rum, tobacco, yummy vanilla, spicy pink pepper, warm vetiver, and a jolt of citrus just floating in your drink. Cosmo editor review: “I wore this perfume almost exclusively from 2020 to 2022, and it reminds me of those treasured nights out we got during the pandemic. This makes sense, considering the whole speakeasy vibe of the scent. It’s forbidden and deep—kinda how it felt to finally go get a drink at a bar after we all got vaccinated.”—BETH GILLETTE, BEAUTY EDITOR Why we love it: Sexy perfumes are inherently subjective. What one person finds enticing, another's gonna think is repulsive. But Carolina Herrera Good Girl is probably as close as it comes to getting objectively sexy. But our team sniffed it next to this flanker, Good Girl Blush, and preferred the softer take of the juice inside this pink bottle. It's still sweet, but with a beautiful powderiness that makes this more delicate and smooth. Cosmo editor's review: “Even though it’s a best-seller, the original Good Girl is way too much for me. But this Blush version? Much more wearable in my opinion. The warm, floral notes feel fresh and approachable and the stiletto-shaped bottle is absolutely iconic.”—LB Why we love it: I wish this is what my laundry came out smelling like. Soft, lightly floral, with a hint of musk that'd make all my clothes feel lived in. Our team prefers smooth scents that aren't too strong—we do, in fact, all sit right next to each other all week—and Mojave Ghost is one we will happily sniff throughout the office. Cosmo editor's review: ""If you’re looking to splurge on a signature scent and don’t know where to start, do yourself a favor and try spritzing yourself in this vibrant and long-lasting scent from Byredo. The fragrance is the perf combo of woody and floral—making it ideal for any occasion,"" Hyman adds. ""Whether it’s date night or a day in the office, I promise this perfume will bring in alllll the compliments.”—JH Why we love it: Famed perfumer Francis Kurkdjian (the brains behind Baccarat Rouge 540, btw) made this perfume, and it smells like something he'd do, tbh. It has all the usual suspects of a Dior perfume, but just intensified. And it smells like pure wealth to us. All of the notes are full-bodied and bold, even though you might not picture a jasmine-focused scent as such. Cosmo editor review: ""Upon first sniff, this became my favorite Dior perfume ever. The bottle is dripped in gold, and that's exactly how I smell whenever I wear it. The notes—jasmine, violet, orange blossom, lily of the valley, and rose—all seem so simple, but together, it makes a really decadent, juicy floral perfume. It's saccharine and thick, giving it extra longevity and projection.""—BG Why we love it: This was the biggest surprise that crossed our desks. 27 87, a new fragrance line creating niche scents, describes this as a ""green, faintly bitter"" scent. And although we don't disagree, it came off extremely fresh and clean to us. We couldn't stop smelling it, wondering what all the notes inside were since they're so unique and blended. (The answer was shocking when we found out there's absinthe in there.) Cosmo editor's review: “I would never gift perfume because it’s so personal, but this is a safe bet. It’s hard to describe the scent honestly, but I’ll tell you how it makes me feel: instantly warm and cozy but kinda sexy and clean. Like I just got out of the shower and wrapped myself in a cashmere robe.”—LB Beth Gillette is the beauty editor at Cosmopolitan, where she covers skincare, makeup, hair, nails, and more across digital and print.

Democrat demands release of 'shocking' Trump-Saudi call from 2019 after Khashoggi's death,"U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman meet in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. REUTERS/Brian Snyder WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Democratic lawmaker who served on Donald Trump’s National Security Council in his first term urged the White House on Friday to release a transcript of Trump’s 2019 call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s killing. ""The Khashoggi family and the American people deserve to know what was in that call... the receipts will raise serious questions,"" Representative Eugene Vindman told a news conference with Khashoggi's widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi. In 2019, Vindman worked on the National Security Council where his job included reviewing confidential telephone calls. ""In my opinion, that call was shocking,"" Vindman, a retired Army officer, said. Vindman declined to release details about the call because it was classified. But he said it involved a quid pro quo, implying that Trump had offered a favor in return for something. Asked for comment, White House communications director Steven Cheung said in an email: ""Vindman is a bitter back-bencher who nobody takes seriously. He is a serial liar."" Trump gave bin Salman a lavish welcome at the White House on Tuesday and defended him over the killing of Khashoggi by Saudi agents, which U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded the crown prince approved. Trump said on Tuesday that bin Salman knew nothing about the October 2018 killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi leadership. Vindman represents Virginia, Khashoggi's home when he was killed at a Saudi consulate in Turkey. Dozens of congressional Democrats joined him this week in signing a letter demanding the White House release the call transcript. Vindman did not specify the date of the call. According to media reports, Trump and the Saudi leader spoke on June 21, 2019. News coverage said they discussed U.S. tensions with Iran and oil prices. In November 2018, Trump said bin Salman may have known about Khashoggi's killing. But, the president said, the U.S. would remain a ""steadfast partner"" to the kingdom and not ""foolishly cancel"" Saudi contracts to buy U.S. military equipment. Vindman said he was concerned by two calls while at the NSC, one with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that led to Trump's first impeachment and the call with the Saudi ruler. Vindman's twin brother, Alexander Vindman, also worked on the security council and blew the whistle on the Zelenskiy call that led to Trump's first impeachment. In that call, Trump suggested that Zelenskiy investigate Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

Grizzly attack on B.C. elementary class is latest in series of encounters,"A Grizzly bear searches for food as he fishes in Khutze Inlet near Princess Royal Island, B.C., Thursday, Sept, 19, 2013. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward A grizzly bear attack on a group of elementary school students in Bella Coola, B.C., on Thursday is the latest in a number of recent encounters with the animals in British Columbia this year. Several people have been badly injured and at least one person has died in separate attacks across the province. Here is a list of attacks in B.C. this year: July 4: A man is flown to hospital after being bitten and scratched by a grizzly in a remote location west of Fort Nelson. Conservation officers say there are no plans to hunt the animal, which had two cubs. July 26: Two grizzly bears attack a couple riding electric bikes in Cranbrook, B.C.

AST Space Mobile Set to Launch First BlueBird 6 Satellite on 15th Dec 2025,"Satellite operator AST SpaceMobile, which is working with Joint Venture (SatCo) partner Vodafone to launch a space-based 4G and 5G mobile (mobile broadband) service to connect with everyday Smartphones on the ground, has announced that their first commercial BlueBird 6 spacecraft will launch on 15th December from the Satish Dhawan Space Center (India). Just to recap. Over the past few yearsâ€™ AST SpaceMobile has conducted several trials of the new platform, including via their prototype 1.5-ton BlueWalker 3 satellite (here) that orbits at an altitude of a little over 500km and features a huge 693-square-foot (64.4-square-meter) phased array antenna (here). The satellite was specifically designed for sending and receiving mobile signals between the space-based platform and regular mobile handsets. The platform was originally developed with support from Vodafone and thus nobody was surprised to see the pair signing a long-term commercial agreement at the end of 2024 (here), which will run until at least 2034. This will support ASTâ€™s efforts toward launching a total of 100 similar satellites (BlueBirds) over the next few years (future models will be larger and more capable). Advertisement BlueBird 6 will be the first of AST SpaceMobileâ€™s next-generation satellites, which features the largest commercial phased array in low Earth orbit at nearly 2,400 square feet. This represents a 3.5 times increase in size over BlueBirds 1-5 and supports 10 times the data capacity. Admittedly, this is also something that may be giving both radio and observational astronomers a few sleepless nights, as such things risk disrupting their research work. Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman and CEO of AST SpaceMobile, said: “Our next-generation satellites will soon enable ubiquitous cellular broadband coverage direct to everyday smartphones from space. As an American company, we are proud to demonstrate U.S. leadership in space innovation while pioneering the next era of global connectivity.” The company added that they’re now “accelerating production” with 40 satellites on track to be completed by early 2026. The company expects five orbital launches by the end of Q1 2026, with launches occurring every one to two months on average, to reach 45â€“60 satellites launched by the end of 2026 and support continuous coverage across the United States and select markets. The first commercial services are still expected to launch in 2026, although it’s currently too early to say precisely how much related mobile roaming / add-on plans will cost in the UK, USA and other countries. But the new SatCo will also be going up against a similar Direct to Cell (DtC) service from Starlink (SpaceX). A number of other satellite networks are also looking to introduce similar functionality in the near future. Members of the public will be able to watch a live broadcast on the launch day on AST SpaceMobile’s YouTube channel. Advertisement Your email address will not be published.

Optical illusion shows black and white image in colour – but only on 1 occasion,"An optical illusion has left viewers absolutely stunned as it tricks their minds into perceiving a black and white image in vivid colour - but only if you carry out one crucial step. Posting the illusion, Dean Jackson, recognised on social media as @beatonthebeeb, displayed a black and white picture of a horse amid sunflowers and cobblestones. He maintains the trick only works for those who concentrate on the horse's eye throughout his one-minute demonstration, explaining how you'll witness the image transform from monochrome to full colour thanks to ""retinal fatigue"". Throughout the footage, he overlays the picture to display ""psychedelic colours"" - such as making the sunflowers blue - which have been deliberately incorporated to ""fatigue some of the receptors in your retina"". Dean continued: ""When I remove them [the superimposed colours] only the ones that are needed to colour the picture should be stimulated."" From that point, he proceeds to count down to the clip's conclusion before it loops back to the beginning. Responding to the footage, one amazed viewer remarked: ""For a split second it was so much colourful than I thought."" Another person commented: ""Wild. When I looked to the side at the flowers, it immediately went black and white. I'd shift my focus back to the eye and the colours came back! Incredible!"" A third viewer observed: ""I definitely wasn't expecting it to be so vivid."" One additional person noted: ""I saw so much colour I got jump scared and blinked."" Another user remarked: ""It absolutely worked but as soon as I blinked it went back to being black and white but didn't expect the colours to be that vibrant. Really good job."" While a final commenter said: ""That's so cool. when I look away from the eye it's black and white again, but if I look back into the eye the colour came back."" Optical illusions do not only trick the eye but they deceive how the brain interprets visual information. A statement on How Stuff Works reads: ""Our perception of optical illusions is controlled by our brains. ""For example, the brain can easily flip between two different views of an object to turn something that's two-dimensional on a piece of paper into an object that we perceive as being 3D. ""But how? It's complicated. The 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded, in part, to David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel for their discoveries in how the brain interprets the coded communications sent to it from the eyes. ""They learned that there is a stepwise process in how the brain analyses what the eye sees. ""Each nerve cell or neuron in the brain is responsible for a specific detail in the pattern of the retinal image. ""But even with Hubel and Wiesel's discoveries and our knowledge of the different parts of the brain that deal with colour, form, motion and texture, scientists still don't really have a sense for how all the messages come together to produce our overall perception of an object.""",2025-11-22 08:04:00,Dailystar Co Uk,negative,0.4785,22,Mikaev_So_And," Dean Jackson, recognised on social media as @beatonthebeeb, created the illusion .

Preparing to study abroad requires knowing what might go wrong during and after the trip,"22/11/2025 Share: Share Story NEW YORK, Nov 22, (AP): After spending two college semesters in northern Thailand, Sarah Jongsma found herself back home in the rural Nevada town where she grew up, surrounded by everything familiar yet feeling strangely out of place. ""It caught me off guard,” she said. ""I didn't know what was going on.” Only later, after a summer studying in India and while preparing to go to France for another semester abroad, did Jongsma understand what she had been feeling: reverse culture shock. The 22-year-old's experience shows that studying abroad can be challenging in unexpected ways. Experts say that’s why students need to study up on not only safety precautions and cultural differences, but also the emotional shifts that may come with leaving home - and returning to it. Planning for low points and potential disappointments, experts say, can help students focus on making the most of a trip that is exciting, challenging and life-changing. ""The value and purpose of studying abroad is to learn about the rest of the world as well as learn about yourself. In fact, it is the juxtaposition of having your assumptions tested that you can gain from studying abroad and helps you understand yourself even better,” said Bill Bull, vice president of risk management for the Council on International Educational Exchange, which facilitates high school, college and faculty study-abroad programs. Here are some tips that experts and students recommend for anyone heading off to learn in a foreign country: Before you travel Along with having an up-to-date passport and a visa, if their host country requires one, students need to be aware of potential risks and cultural expectations based on their ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation and religion. Many countries do not recognize same-sex unions, so experts suggest being careful of open interactions with a partner of the same sex. Women may face cultural expectations around dress or hair, or find it hard to obtain birth control or feminine hygiene products they didn't think to bring with them. ""Make plans for what you will do when things go wrong, because things can go wrong and things will go wrong,” said Bull, who recommends connecting with students who studied abroad, as well as their parents, for advice they wished they’d had. ""It doesn’t mean it has to be the end of your experience. It just means that you need to be ready to manage it.” Some study-abroad programs offer basic health coverage, but students should consider medical evacuation insurance and check whether any of their regular prescribed medications are illegal abroad. The U.S. Department of State also recommends enrolling in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, a free safety and security alert service for U.S. citizens. Advance research also is important for students still thinking about whether to apply for a study-abroad program. Financial and academic planning are equally important, as they are among the biggest barriers for students seeking to study abroad, said Phoebe Stears-Macauley, a Germany and Spain program advisor for the University Studies Abroad Consortium, which offers study-abroad programs for university students. ""Meet with your academic advisors, talk through the classes you will take and how those will transfer back, and meet with your financial aid office,” she said. While a lot of the preparation and precautions are about practical needs, experts and students say it's just as much about setting realistic expectations. When Jongsma left for the Thai city of Chiang Mai in 2023, it was her first time traveling internationally and being away from her parents. ""When you're getting ready to leave, you get really focused on your own personal goals and how you’re going to meet them,” she said. ""I don’t think you realize that when you get there, you'll miss your community a lot.” Homesickness may feel even sharper around holidays like Thanksgiving, especially for students who have not spent them away from family before. Jongsma suggests bringing small reminders of home with you and keeping a journal. She also packed a small portable printer for her summer studies in Bengaluru, India, in case she wanted to print out pictures of family and friends. While abroad Once students arrive at their destination, experts suggest slowing down and observing their surroundings. A common regret Stears-Macauley said she hears from returning students, especially those who studied in Europe, is that they spent every weekend traveling and not getting to know their host city. Bull advises students to think about why they are studying abroad in the first place and what they hope to get from the experience. Choosing to be present in the moment instead of constantly taking photos can make the time far more meaningful and yield cultural clues that help you fit in, he said. ""Anyone can go be a tourist,” Bull said. ""You want to notice what’s going on around you. You want to look at what people are wearing and what they’re not wearing. You want to see, do people stop at the red lights or do they cross anyway?"" Programs can last anywhere from a few weeks to more than a year, and students may face mental health challenges such as loneliness, depression, or language-related anxiety. Many programs offer on-site support, but experts say students should have a plan in place before those symptoms occur. For Dominic Motter, who spent a semester in London in 2023, familiar routines helped when homesickness struck. Like Jongsma, Motter's trip abroad was his first time away from family and friends for an extended period of time, and he was surprised when confronted with the feeling of homesickness. ""I’d never known that feeling before,” he said. An avid runner, Motter would jog in the park whenever he felt overwhelmed, a simple ritual from back home that helped him feel more grounded. He also found comfort in decorating his room, both with items from home and new souvenirs from his travels. At the end of the day, he said it helped him feel like he was ""coming home.” ""Instead of it feeling like a temporary dorm room or hotel room,"" he said, it put him in the mindset that ""this is now my new home.” Upon return Experts say many students returning home are going through a transition and may struggle with reverse culture shock without realizing it. ""You’ve had this transformative experience. You’ve changed and grown so much, and you come back to the place where you were before, and it’s all different because you’re so different,” Stears-Macauley said. She suggests joining local international clubs or alumni associations from the foreign school you attended to find support. Students can also prepare by answering the following questions, Bull said: How will you contextualize your experience? What aspects are most important to share? Which details are suitable for brief conversations, and which are better saved for deeper conversations with people who want to understand what made the experience meaningful? For Jongsma, it helped to create new experiences in a familiar place - even something as simple as checking out a new museum, she said. Motter, who spent his first few weeks wishing he were back in London, said it helped to talk with the friends he’d made there because they actually understood what he was feeling. As he put it: ""It’ll eventually feel like home again.""

Dear Abby: Single son’s attempts to keep parents close seem to be failing,"DEAR ABBY: I am 40 and single, with no children and no girlfriend. For many years, it has become increasingly difficult to get my parents to come to my home for dinner. They live only 45 minutes away. Both are retired and healthy. As anyone who knows me can attest, my home is always clean, smells great and I love to cook. Abby, it’s a miracle and an act of God when they finally agree to a date and time to visit. I invite them for dinner at least three times a week (because they decline the first or second time), and it’s months before they actually accept. It appears they just don’t have the desire and it’s hurtful. I have spoken to them about this, but it has gone nowhere. Two weeks ago, they finally agreed to come after a month or two. I was happy and excited, only to have them cancel midday. They seem to have no issue picking up one or both of my nieces once or twice a week, going to yoga, attending concerts or festivities, coming into the city twice a week, taking trips, etc. It feels like it’s expected of me to go to their place and, if I refuse, it’s always, “Oh, why?” I have been the black sheep for 25 years, and I wonder if I were married and had kids, would Mom and Dad come over as they do with my brother and sister-in-law? What is your advice? -- HOME ALONE IN NEW YORK DEAR HOME ALONE: If your parents are keeping up the travel schedule you have described, they are living full, busy lives. It may make more sense (in their view) for you to come to them. I detect a smidge of sibling rivalry in your letter. Because you can’t force other adults to change their behavior, it might make sense for you to change your attitude about the family dynamic if that’s possible. DEAR ABBY: I’m 19. My father’s mother has never been a grandmother figure in my life. No healthy relationship was ever formed. My dad says it was her fault, but she has implied that the fault lies with my mother. Dad’s mother accepts close to zero responsibility for the situation. I recently, by accident, referred to her by her first name, and my aunt (Dad’s sister) thought it was disrespectful. How can I politely make her understand that I wasn’t being disrespectful because there is NO RELATIONSHIP? I don’t think anyone sees this from my point of view. There’s an overwhelming consensus that I need to forgive and forget because she is technically my grandmother. I don’t share this feeling. Any thoughts? -- TECHNICALLY THE GRANDDAUGHTER DEAR GRANDDAUGHTER: You do not have to forgive and forget a grandmother who never tried to have a relationship with you. However, in order to keep peace in the family, you DO have to treat the woman with respect. A way to do that would be to use her honorific and refer to her as “Grandma.” Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Alison Hammond says 'no one should have to' as homeless mum opens up about tough Christmas,"Television presenter Alison Hammond, 50, has expressed her distress after learning about the harsh realities faced by homeless families living in temporary accommodation during the festive period. The star has joined forces with housing charity Shelter for their latest winter appeal, meeting Alicia, a 39 year old single mother currently residing in temporary accommodation with her six year old son, Aeon. Visibly moved to tears during their conversation, Alison told the Mirror: ""I couldn't believe what Alicia was telling me - it really got me."" Read more: Family home blasted with revolver She's a single mom the same way that I am so I really felt connected to her in that way and could feel the love she has for her son. No one should have to live how Alicia and Aeon are living currently. They're in temporary accommodation but they've been there for over 5 years now – that doesn't feel very temporary to me. ""Alicia is so strong and positive despite what she's been through and is still going through, and I just think she's amazing to be honest with you. I came away feeling inspired by her, but heartbroken to know thousands of families are in similar situations to them and will be spending Christmas homeless in damp, mouldy and unsafe temporary accommodation. ""Both of them have been struggling with their breathing lately, and Aeon's even been in hospital. She's laying two types of mouse traps because the infestation's got that bad, and on top of that she's sorting all the legal papers out... This is Alicia's Christmas to-do list. Can you imagine? No family should have to spend Christmas like this."", reports the Mirror. During an emotional face-to-face discussion for the campaign, Alison meets fellow mother Alicia, who discloses that she and her young son Aeon have experienced homelessness for almost six years - effectively his entire childhood. She explains how they've been relocated from one temporary residence to another, continuously fighting mould, dampness, and the instability of never knowing their next destination. Alison becomes visibly emotional and appears devastated as Alicia outlines her festive preparations, which involve purchasing additional mouse traps, following up on property repairs, and addressing wall mould, whilst simultaneously attempting to create a memorable Christmas for her child. The documentary arrives during a period when homelessness has reached unprecedented levels, with 172,420 children presently homeless in temporary accommodation across England - the largest figure since data collection commenced 21 years ago. Alicia, 39, is a lone parent currently experiencing homelessness and residing in temporary accommodation in London alongside her six year old son, Aeon. Aeon has experienced housing instability throughout his life. When Alicia initially became homeless, she explains she ""went straight into survival mode."" She explained: ""You just think, I need to find some kind of stability. I felt really alone and didn't want to be a burden to anyone. The first temporary accommodation I lived in was awful; there was damp everywhere, you could smell it, and there were bedbugs - I had to throw away all my mattresses. My mental health really suffered, and I felt so isolated, like it was just me and my son against the world. Now, in my current accommodation, there's mould and mice, and I don't feel safe. My asthma has gotten worse, my son's breathing has gotten worse, and there are moments when he stops breathing at night. I feel like I'm getting bounced around, and you start to feel forgotten."" When circumstances became too overwhelming to cope with on her own, Alicia contacted Shelter for assistance, connecting with a Helpline adviser who clarified her legal entitlements and supported her through the process of finding safer, more appropriate temporary housing. Alison further commented: ""Alicia was saying that she feels forgotten, and that her and Aeon are lost in the system and I'm not surprised she's feeling like that to be honest with you because it's been so long and they haven't been given any update on when they might be getting a home. When I was younger, my mum was given a social home and it was a really nice house to grow up in. That was a real lifeline for my mum at the time and it meant safety and security for me, my brother and sister growing up. I just wish that was the case for Alicia and Aeon, and for all of the other families who are stuck in temporary accommodation with no end in sight."" Record-high private rents and a severe lack of affordable social homes are pushing more families to the edge, depriving them of the basic necessity of a safe and stable home. Shelter's emergency helpline, online advice, and frontline services offer support to families facing homelessness. Sarah Elliott, Chief Executive Officer at Shelter, stated: ""Every day we hear from families in temporary accommodation who are terrified of waiting out the winter in appalling conditions, watching their breath hang in the air as damp and mould climbs the walls. Their experience is only worsened by bitter isolation, as many are moved miles away from their extended families, schools, and communities. ""At Shelter, we're doing everything possible to help parents fight for a better home for their children. No family should face homelessness alone this Christmas. Donate today and you can help connect parents to someone who will provide support now, and in the tough times ahead.""",2025-11-22 08:04:00,Birmingham Live,negative,0.507,-1,Outlier," Alison Hammond, 50, joined forces with Shelter for their latest winter appeal .

Dahmen misses cut at RSM Classic; will lose full PGA Tour card,"ST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. — Joel Dahmen, who narrowly kept his PGA Tour card last year at Sea Island, missed the cut Friday at The RSM Classic and will lose his full card for next year with the PGA reducing exempt cards to the top 100 instead of the top 125. The Clarkston native had a 2-under 68 in Round 2 and finished his tournament at 5 under. He had three birdies and one bogey on the day. Dahmen was at No. 117 in the FedEx Cup fall standings entering this week’s tournament — a mark that would’ve been good enough to keep his full PGA Tour card under the old format, but not with the reduction to the top 100 instead of 125. Last year, Dahmen had a heroic ending to his PGA season when he survived the bubble at the 2024 RSM Classic after entering the tournament in 124th place in the FedEx Cup fall standings. Dahmen saved his best for last with a 6-under 64 in the final round to finish tied for 35th at the event. Despite missing the cut a year later, it wasn’t all bad news for the Dahmen family in November. Joel and Lona Dahmen welcomed their second son, Dawson, to the family earlier this month. The Dahmens’ first son, Riggs, was born in January 2023. “I’ve got a 5-day old baby at home. I’m worried about that more than anything else,” Dahmen said recently. “If I’m not playing 25 weeks next year, then I get to hang out with a couple of amazing kids and my wife so there’s no real downside to it, just less golf.” How the rest of the field fared Andrew Novak took advantage of more benign weather Friday and the absence of the pressure facing so many others in the PGA Tour’s season finale. He had a 7-under 65 on the Plantation Course at Sea Island to take a one-shot lead into the weekend. Novak has gone three months without competition dating to the Tour Championship, the culmination of a breakthrough year. His wife gave birth to their first child two weeks ago. And then he went 61-65 to lead over Stanford alums Michael Thorbjornsen and Patrick Rodgers. But the real focus was far down the leaderboard at the cut line, so critical in the final event with players having to be among the top 100 in the FedEx Cup to keep full status for next year. Beau Hossler is at No. 103 and making the cut was his only hope. He hit a tough chip to set up birdie on the par-5 eighth at the Plantation, and then got up-and-down from a bunker on his final hole at No. 9 for a 67 to make the cut on the number. His work is not done, but at least he has a chance. The conditions have been so calm that the cut fell at 7-under 135. “Kind of tough, honestly, this week with it just going to be an absolute shootout — no wind, greens are very receptive, virtually no rough. So just knowing that it’s more or less just going to be a wedge and putting contest,” Hossler said. Among those who missed the cut were former British Open champion Brian Harman and Sahith Theegala. Also missing the cut was Takumi Kanaya, which could leave him wistful more about last week. He had a 4-foot par putt with a raging wind affecting him in Bermuda. Had he made it, his tie for second would have moved to No. 83 in the FedEx Cup. He missed and moved up only to No. 99, and now he has to hope no one passes him on the weekend. Novak was oblivious to all of this. He shot a 61 on Seaside in the opening round and followed that with a 65 to reach 16-under 126. His only lament was losing a chance to create some separation by making bogeys on two of the last three holes. Even so, his place on the PGA Tour is set for next year. And having reached the Tour Championship, he’s also in all the majors and $20 million signature events. All around him were players trying to keep their cards. “That’s such an advantage this week,” Novak said. “I had a baby two weeks ago, I’m just here getting out of the house and happy to be here and other guys are fighting for their job. I’ve got a little bit less riding on it. I definitely want to win. It’s a local tournament so there is extra motivation for me to play well here for that. “But some guys have their entire years riding on this week.” Thorbjornsen had a 63 at Seaside and Rodgers had a 62 at Plantation. One shot behind were Sami Valimaki and Greyson Sigg, each with a 62 — Valimaki at Season, Sigg at Plantation. Johnny Keefer, the Korn Ferry Tour player of the year who received a sponsor exemption, had a 64 at Seaside and was three shots behind. A finish in the top 5 might be enough for Keefer — who is No. 50 in the world — to secure a Masters invitation through the world ranking.",2025-11-22 08:04:00,The Lewiston Tribune Online,negative,0.5628,82,Dellavedova_Novak_Blanchfield," Joel Dahmen will lose his full PGA Tour card for next year with the PGA reducing exempt cards to the top 100 instead of the top 125 .

Indian Railways Crosses 1 Billion Tonne Freight Loading In FY26 To Date,"According to the statement, these measures aim to increase bulk handling capacity, reduce transit time, and lower logistics costs, directly benefiting both industry players and end consumers while driving greater efficiency across the supply chain. Trending Photos New Delhi: Indian Railways' freight performance continues to strengthen India's economic backbone, with cumulative loading this year crossing the 1-billion-tonne mark -- reaching 1020 million tonnes (MT) -- to date, the Ministry of Railways said on Saturday. This milestone reflects broad-based support from key sectors. Coal remained the largest contributor at 505 MT, followed by iron ore (115 MT), cement (92 MT), container traffic (59 MT), pig iron &amp; finished steel (47 MT), fertilisers (42 MT), mineral oil (32 MT), foodgrains (30 MT), raw materials for steel plants (approx. 20 MT), and balance-other-goods (74 MT), as of November 19. Daily loading continues to hold strong at around 4.4 MT, higher than 4.2 MT last year, demonstrating improved operational efficiency and sustained demand, the ministry informed. Freight loading between April to October further underscores this positive trajectory, touching 935.1 MT in 2025, compared to 906.9 MT during the same period last year, marking a healthy year-on-year growth. Add Zee News as a Preferred Source ""This sustained momentum, combined with improved daily loading rates, demonstrates Railways' capacity to support India's industrial expansion and infrastructure development,"" the ministry said in a statement. Recognising the critical role of cement in India's infrastructure growth, Railways has taken significant steps to optimise this segment's logistics capabilities. The recent rollout of comprehensive reforms, including the Policy for Bulk Cement Terminals and rationalised rates for bulk cement movement in containers, represents a strategic initiative to modernise cement transportation. According to the statement, these measures aim to increase bulk handling capacity, reduce transit time, and lower logistics costs, directly benefiting both industry players and end consumers while driving greater efficiency across the supply chain. Such targeted interventions catalyse sectoral transformation. Shifting bulk goods movement to rail yields multiple benefits that extend beyond mere commercial metrics. It reduces carbon footprints, decongests highways, and provides industries, including MSMEs, access to greener logistics solutions. These developments reinforce India's commitment to sustainable growth, aligning freight operations with the nation's journey towards Net Zero Carbon Emission targets and positioning Railways as a catalyst for both economic and environmental progress, the Ministry noted.

There are moments in life that carve themselves so deeply into one’s memory that they alter the shape of time. Some nights refuse to fade, no matter how many dawns arrive after them. For me, the night of the Nowgam Police Station blast is one such night — a night that split my life into a before and an after. It took away not just a cousin, but the person I knew as my elder brother, my confidant, my closest companion: Inspector Asrar Ahmad Shah. This tribute is not just an obituary for a fallen officer. It is a remembrance of a life lived with integrity, humility and service. It is an attempt to capture, in mere words, the magnitude of a loss that continues to echo through our home, our extended family, and the uniformed fraternity he served with distinction. A bond beyond blood Asrar and I were cousins by relation, but brothers by heart and upbringing. We grew up together in Drugmulla, sharing the same childhood lanes, festivals, meals, mischiefs and quarrels. Over the years, that early camaraderie matured into something deeper — a bond strengthened by trust, shared experiences, and the unspoken understanding that we could turn to each other in moments of uncertainty. Our relationship grew particularly close in recent years. Life, responsibilities and career had taken us into different worlds, but somehow we kept finding our way back to each other. Asrar had a quiet habit of confiding in me. He would call at odd hours, discussing things that weighed on him, talking freely about work pressures, observations, and the difficult situations that his job in the police often placed him in. I was, in some strange but cherished way, both his sounding board and his anchor. A small but unforgettable moment came recently when I received my renewed passport. I called him to share the news, expecting a quick congratulatory remark. Instead, he insisted — rather joyfully — that I had to host a small celebration. “Gani & Sons ch party denni !” (Throw a party at Gani & Sons!) And so we did. Our entire family gathered for a casual, cheerful evening, full of laughter and warm conversations. None of us knew that night that we were creating a final memory — a moment that would soon become a precious relic of a time before tragedy arrived. The officer behind the uniform Inspector Asrar Ahmad Shah did not wear his uniform for admiration. He wore it for responsibility. Posted at the State Investigation Agency (SIA) Headquarters, Humhama, he was known for his sincerity, precision and silent dedication. He was the kind of officer who earned respect not through authority, but through character. Whenever I visited him at SIA, he introduced me to his seniors with a mixture of affection and humour: “Yeh Adnan 100 bemariyon ka ilaaj hai.” (Adnan is the cure for a hundred illnesses.) His colleagues would smile, but behind the joke was the truth — he trusted me, relied on our bond, and valued our connection. Officers who worked with him describe him using words that in today’s policing environment are rare: humble, balanced, professional, soft-spoken, reliable. His approach to work was not marked by bravado or display; he quietly completed tasks that demanded both discipline and discretion. His calm temperament made him an anchor even in high-pressure situations. The night everything changed On the night of the incident, around 11 pm, I stepped outside and heard a loud explosion in the distance. Kashmir, unfortunately, is no stranger to such sounds, yet that night, something about the blast unsettled me. I brushed it off, not knowing that life had already shifted beneath my feet. Five minutes later, a Twitter notification appeared on my phone. Journalist Ahmad Ali Fayaz had posted about a blast in Nowgam. A sense of dread washed over me. My instinct sent me straight to my phone. I called Asrar Bhai. The first call showed “busy.” The second — switched off. An inexplicable fear tightened around my chest. I immediately called his wife, Shahida, whom we affectionately call Dia. “Has Asrar reached home?” I asked. “No… not yet,” she replied softly. By then, I was already rushing towards Nowgam. Something inside me kept repeating a truth I did not want to accept: something has gone terribly wrong. On the way, I phoned my cousin Zaheer in Kupwara. My voice trembled as I said, “Leave immediately. Come to Srinagar. And don’t tell anyone anything.” I then tried calling my father multiple times. When he finally returned the call, I was crying uncontrollably. He panicked, thinking I had met with an accident. “No, Abba… not me,” I said, fighting my breath. Then came the words that broke both of us: “Asrar Bhai is no more…” My father’s silence on the phone cut deeper than any sound. Another cousin, Arif Rasool, who works for a multinational company in Srinagar, called me, asking, “Where are you? Tell me where to come.” Everyone was moving, calling, searching — yet the truth was racing ahead of all of us. I kept driving between Nowgam Police Station and Budshah Flats, where Asrar lived. My mind was in a storm — one part rushing to the station to find him, another part rushing to his home to somehow shield his wife from immediate heartbreak. I told her only that he was injured, sparing her the unbearable truth for the moment because the children were asleep. His father — our Dadijaan — reached the Police Control Room (PCR) soon after. I held his hand and repeated the only thing I could: “We haven’t found him yet, but we heard he might be injured.” It was a sentence made of hope, fear and denial. We lived that way till 8 in the morning — suspended between the faint hope that he might still be alive and the crushing fear that he was gone. At 8 am, I finally went to Budshah Flats again. This time, I sat with his father and gently told him what I had known in my heart since midnight: “Dadijaan… it is possible we have lost Asrar.” That moment broke him — and broke all of us in ways words cannot fully capture. A confirmation no family deserves The requirement for DNA sampling at that stage confirmed what none of us wanted to believe. Nothing prepares a family for that kind of news — not in Kashmir, not anywhere in the world. After that, everything turned into a blur — of grief, of silence, of formalities, of prayers, and of an aching emptiness that began settling into our home. What remains vivid, however, are the extraordinary gestures of compassion shown in the hours that followed. The police force stands with us Senior officers of the Jammu & Kashmir Police visited our home in Drugmulla soon after the tragedy. Their presence was not ceremonial; it was human, empathetic and deeply felt. DGP Nalin Prabhat, in particular, said something to me that has stayed etched in my memory: “It has been a year since I took charge, and I did not know him personally. But what I have heard about Inspector Asrar from different officers is mind-blowing.” Coming from the highest-ranking officer in the police hierarchy, this was not merely a condolence — it was an acknowledgement of Asrar’s character, professionalism and silent contributions. It affirmed something I already knew: he was respected not just by those close to him, but across the ranks. A life of service, a legacy of integrity Inspector Asrar Ahmad Shah was many things: A devoted police officer. A loving husband. A caring father. A dutiful son. A steadfast friend. And for me — a brother. His life was anchored in qualities that seem almost old-fashioned today: sincerity, humility, discipline and an unwavering sense of responsibility. He approached his work with quiet dignity and his family with tender devotion. He never boasted of his achievements. In fact, he rarely spoke about himself at all. His integrity did not need a spotlight; it revealed itself through actions—in the way he handled difficult assignments, supported his colleagues, or patiently navigated complex situations. His death is not merely a personal loss for our family. It is a loss for the police force and for the society he served. Officers like him are not easily found—men who wear the uniform not for power, but for purpose; not for recognition, but for responsibility. The final goodbye On the day of his funeral, I was overwhelmed by a strange, painful realisation: God had chosen me to accompany him from the first moment of the tragedy to the last moment at the graveyard. I was the one who waited for him that night, expecting him to return from duty. I was the one who received his body. I was the one who walked with him to his final resting place. I was the one who lowered him gently into the grave, handing him back to the Almighty. It was the heaviest honour of my life—one that will stay with me forever. Gone too soon, remembered forever “Asrar Bhai Gone Too Soon” is not just a headline. It is the truth of our lives now. He left us quietly, abruptly, painfully—but he left behind a legacy that will continue to guide us. His children will grow up knowing their father was a man of honour. His wife will forever carry the strength he admired in her. His parents will remember him with pride. His colleagues will recall him as a rare officer who embodied integrity without noise. And I—I will remember him as the boy I grew up with, the man who trusted me with every thought, and the brother whose absence has carved a silence in my days. May Allah grant him the highest place in Jannah. May He give patience and strength to his family, his friends and everyone whose life he touched. Ameen. Views expressed above are the author's own.

Insecurity: Kefas Shuts Down Boarding Schools In Taraba,"Taraba State Governor, Agbu Kefas, has ordered all secondary schools both public and private to immediately send their boarding students home following heightened security threats across the country. The directive was issued in a statement signed by the State Commissioner for Education, Dr. Augustina Godwin. She stated that the rising wave of insecurity has made boarding students vulnerable to targeted attacks by bandits, citing the recent abductions of schoolgirls in Kebbi and Niger states as worrying indicators. READ ALSO: According to Dr. Godwin, Kefas has now directed that all secondary schools in the state operate strictly as day schools until security conditions improve. School principals and private school owners have been instructed to commence immediate deboarding of students.

Nigeria school attacks: 215 students kidnapped from Catholic school amid outrage over violence against Christians,"Police in Nigeria’s north-central Niger State reported that a group of armed bandits invaded a private Catholic school abducting hundreds of schoolchildren early on Friday, amid widespread outrage over violence against Christians in the West African nation. Despite some students managing to get to safety during the attack, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) said 215 students and 12 teachers were abducted in the raid. Parents have been arriving at the school to pick their children up, ahead of the school shutting down, CAN’s Niger State chapter chairman Most. Rev. Bulus Dauwa Yohanna said. Yohanna, who visited the school and met parents of the abducted children, said the association was working with the government and security agencies to bring the children back safely, according to his spokesman. Christian Association of Nigeria The abduction in Niger, which borders Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, follows a similar attack on a church by gunmen in neighboring Kwara State earlier in the week. During the church attack, at least two people were killed, and several worshippers, including the pastor, were abducted. In addition, this week, armed men kidnapped 25 female students when they stormed a government girls’ boarding school in northwestern Kebbi State. Tragically, the school’s vice principal was shot and killed during this attack. The Niger State government condemned the latest attack on St. Mary’s School, stating that “the exact number of abducted pupils is yet to be confirmed.” The Niger State police command issued a statement Friday indicating that security forces have deployed to the area and are “combing the forests” in an effort to rescue the abducted students. Nigeria is currently facing a concerning wave of attacks by armed groups that target vulnerable civilian populations and orchestrate mass abductions for ransom. The country is also plagued by religiously motivated attacks and other violent conflicts stemming from communal and ethnic tensions, as well as disputes between farmers and herders over limited access to land and water resources. US President Donald Trump has frequently expressed outrage over disputed allegations of a “mass slaughter” of Christians by Islamist insurgents in Nigeria and has threatened military action to protect this religious group. Earlier this month, Trump designated Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the US International Religious Freedom Act, suggesting that his administration has determined Nigeria has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.” The recent string of attacks coincides with the arrival of a Nigerian delegation in Washington for discussions with US government officials. A Pentagon official confirmed a meeting that took place on Thursday between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Nigeria’s National Security Adviser, Mallam Nuhu Ribadu. Additionally, the Nigerian delegation is scheduled to meet Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau on Friday, according to a State Department spokesperson.",2025-11-22 08:03:49,Egyptindependent,negative,0.628,26,Belongs_Preserved_Resigned, Police in Nigeria's north-central Niger State report that armed bandits invaded a private Catholic school abducting hundreds of schoolchildren early on Friday .

East Valley overcomes Lynden to reach Class 2A semifinals for first time since 2004,"East Valley’s Cody Gasseling, right, celebrates after running for a first down late in the fourth quarter to end the game against Lynden Saturday, Nov. 22, 2025, in Yakima, Wash. Call it a perk of a truly dominating season, but No. 3 East Valley trailed only fleetingly during an undefeated run to its Saturday Class 2A state quarterfinal. With 10 of its 11 wins by 23 points or more, it was fair to wonder how the Red Devils would meet the moment when they matched up with a fellow state championship contender. The second of two long, morale-draining scoring drives gave No. 6 Lynden a touchdown lead with 31 seconds left in the first half and provided EV with that very inflection point. Finally challenged. What would be the response? The Red Devils answered emphatically. And, most critically, quickly. Senior quarterback Jaxon Berg needed only three plays to orchestrate a scoring drive, connecting with Cody Gasseling for a 31-yard score to spark a 27-24 come-from-behind victory at West Valley's Clasen Field as EV continued to generate chunk plays on offense and slow a methodical, pounding Lynden rushing attack in the second half. ""We had a lot of things that didn't go our way, and we haven't had that necessarily this season,"" EV coach Eric Berg said. ""For that to happen tonight, and for these kids to come through and do what they did today, that was pretty amazing."" An errant extra-point snap kept Lynden ahead at intermission, and the Lions added to their advantage with a 39-yard field goal after the Red Devils were unable score on four tries from inside the 2 on their first possession of the new half. East Valley’s Cody Gasseling scores a touchdown against Lynden in a 2A state quarterfinal game Saturday, Nov. 22, 2025, in Yakima, Wash. But again EV (12-0) responded promptly. Gasseling, taking on a larger role in the run game with starting running back Braden Albrecht limited due to injury, ripped off a 40-yard run. And after a rare incompletion, Berg hit Greyson Stevens on a screen pass and the Montana State commit darted 27 yards for East Valley's first lead of the game. Stevens also set up EV's first score with a long punt return and snagged five of Berg's nine completions on 14 attempts. The 6-foot-2, 230-pound Gasseling, who's listed as a tight end, again proved to be a more-than-capable fill-in for Albrecht, rushing for 126 yards on 16 carries a week after rumbling for 133 and a pair of scores. ""He's a beast,"" Jaxon Berg said. ""He's getting so much better at reading holes, putting his shoulder down and running through people."" He found the end zone twice on the ground again Saturday, capping an all-run, 11-play, 66-yard drive with a two-yard score to put EV up 27-17 with less than eight minutes left in the fourth quarter. ""Three to four yards is fine for us every play,"" Gasseling said, alluding to the methodical nature of the drive. ""Credit to our offensive line. We just ate."" Lynden, which has played in the last six quarterfinals and won 10 state titles since 1980, quickly moved to claw back in the game. Quarterback Lukas Lalji connected with Samm Puello Arango for a 60-yard score, the duo's second touchdown of the day, to pull within three. East Valley’s Zeliah Wade sacks Lynden’s Lukas Lalji in a 2A state quarterfinal game Saturday, Nov. 22, 2025, in Yakima, Wash. Lalji and Co. had a shot to retake the lead after the Lions forced a three-and-out. But backed up to the 4-yard-line by an excellent Stevens punt and pressured by CWAC defensive MVP Zeliah Wade, the speedy QB who rushed for 169 yards and a first-quarter touchdown was unable to move the chains. All that stood between East Valley and its first semifinal trip since 2004 was a first down, and Gasseling appeared to pick it up with a third-down run, but a penalty for aiding the runner moved the Red Devils back to third-and-6. A four-yard Gasseling gain and Lynden's last timeout set up a fourth-and-2 for the ballgame. Eric Berg again turned to Gasseling, who was marked down right at the line to gain, necessitating a measurement by the chain gang. East Valley’s Greyson Stevens stiff-arms Lynden’s Lawsen DeBoer on his way to a touchdown in a 2A state quarterfinal game Saturday, Nov. 22, 2025, in Yakima, Wash. ""The whole game flashed before my eyes,"" said Albrecht, a captain who gritted his way to 12 carries for 24 yards and key tackles on defense while clearly playing at less than full strength. ""I was fully ready to jump up and down, and I was fully ready to run back out there on defense and give it everything I had for that last minute."" The chains stretched, and EV was awarded a first down. By an inch. Or maybe a millimeter. The margin matters little to a program enjoying a generational season fueled by some of the Valley's most productive players. Berg's two TD passes were his 89th and 90th of his high school career, the fourth-most in Valley history, while Stevens is one of four players in Valley history with more than 3,500 receiving yards. They'll get a chance to add to their historic tallies and reach the school's third state title game with a semifinal matchup Nov. 29 at No. 2 Tumwater, which beat No. 7 Franklin Pierce 27-6 in its quarterfinal. ""It means everything to me,"" Albrecht said while holding back tears. ""To be able to go out and play with my brothers one more week, I don't care if it's only one more week. I'm putting my life out on the line, that's my mindset. Leave everything out there.""

22-year-old suspect arrested after fatal shooting at Hanks Drive apartment complex,"A 22-year-old Baton Rouge man was arrested for allegedly shooting a man at the La Playa Place apartment complex on Hanks Drive this Thursday. Darrel Thomas, 20, was booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish jail on a count each of second-degree murder, illegal carrying of weapons and possession of more than 14 grams of marijuana. East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's deputies were originally called to the La Playa Place complex shortly before 9 p.m. on Thursday after a ShotSpotter device reported possible gunshots in the area. Upon arrival, deputies located a man suffering from multiple gunshot wounds on the sidewalk inside the complex. EMS treated the man, who succumbed to his injuries and died. Deputies found multiple firearm casings near the victim's body, as well as other spent casings near the front doors of two nearby apartment units. The casings were of assorted calibers. A white Honda Civic, which was parked near these units, also appeared to be struck by gunshots. CCTV footage from the apartment showed the Civic was parked outside of the apartment complex for around 15 minutes. The footage also showed multiple unidentified people discharging firearms near the Civic and the apartment units' front doors. Homicide detectives with EBRSO returned to the complex with a search warrant for those units on Friday morning, according to an affidavit for Thomas's arrest. Inside, they located Thomas and another man with the same last name, Matalius Thomas, 21, in a back bedroom. Five firearms were located in the same bedroom, three of which were Glock handguns. Over 20 grams of marijuana were also seized from the same room. The two men were arrested on counts of illegal carrying of weapons and possession of marijuana. Later, detectives interviewed witnesses who identified Darrell Thomas as being a suspect in the homicide. Darrell Thomas was allegedly armed with a Glock handgun and seen firing on the victim from near his unit's front door. The witness said Darrell Thomas went inside the unit after the shooting. While witnesses said Darrell Thomas didn't live at La Playa Place, police records show his address as being at the complex. Witness statements were consistent with CCTV footage of the shooting, the arrest warrant said. Firearms collected inside the apartment unit are currently being analyzed at the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab alongside the spent cartridges from the shooting. The victim in this shooting has yet to be identified by the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office.

(AP Photo/Anis Mili) People take part in a protest against Tunisian president Kais Saied’s rule and demanding the release of political prisoners in Tunis, Tunisia, Saturday, Nov. 22, 2025. (AP Photo/Anis Mili) TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Tunisians took to the streets of downtown Tunis on Saturday over what they described as President Kais Saied ’s increasingly authoritarian rule and demanding the release of all jailed political prisoners. The rally, held under the banner “Against Injustice,” brought together families of political detainees and activists from different ideological backgrounds. The demonstration drew more than 1,000 protesters, some dressed in black and chanting anti-regime slogans, including “The people want to overthrow the regime,” “What a great country! Oppression and tyranny!” and “No fear no terror, the street belongs to the people.” The protest came as part of a broader surge in protests nationwide over political and economic turmoil under Saied’s rule. On Thursday, Tunisian journalists protested against the widening crackdown on the freedom of the press and the temporary suspension of several prominent civil society organizations. Protesters also called out Saied’s interference in the judiciary and accused him of using the police to target political opponents. Ayoub Amara, one of the organizers, told reporters on Saturday that the protest aimed to highlight the plight of those held in Tunisian prisons for their political opinions. He said it also touched on other broader grievances, including environmental protests convulsing the phosphate-producing city of Gabes and arbitrary arrests under anti-terrorism laws. “All the progress of the past 14 years has been overturned,” Amara said. “ Tunisia is big enough for all Tunisians, and no single person can rule it according to his whims.” Monia Brahim, the wife of jailed opposition figure Abdelhamid Jlassi, said she joined the march because she believes “many Tunisians are facing deep injustice.” “I came to defend my rights as a citizen,” she told The Associated Press. “Political prisoners know for a fact that they are in prison to pay the price for their principles, their constitutional right for civil and political activism, and are being held hostage by the regime established today in Tunisia.” Among those detained, some are currently on hunger strike including constitutional law professor Jawher Ben Mbarek who has been striking for over 20 days. Several rights groups have raised increasing alarm over the growing scale of repression in Tunisia. Human Rights Watch has said that over 50 people, including politicians, lawyers, journalists and activists, have been subjected to arbitrary arrest or prosecution since late 2022, for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly or political activity. The rights group also warned that broad anti-terrorism and cybercrime laws were being utilized to criminalize dissent and tame all forms of free speech. Saied, who suspended parliament and consolidated all branches of power in July 2021, said his actions were necessary to root out corruption, eliminate “traitors” and restore state institutions.",2025-11-22 20:06:59,Apnews,neutral,0.6851,-1,Outlier," Tunisians took to the streets of downtown Tunis on Saturday over what they described as President Kais Saied ’s increasingly authoritarian rule .

Dear Abby: I yelled at daughter’s bum boyfriend 6 years ago and he’s still mad about it,"DEAR ABBY: My daughter is asking me to apologize to her boyfriend, “Harry,” for yelling at him when I was helping them move six years ago. (I had traveled 250 miles to help.) The day of the move, Harry didn’t take the day off work, so he wasn’t there to help. (They had a second-floor unit with no elevator.) When he finally did show up, he proceeded to slow-walk taking out the recycling stuff. At the new place, Harry helped somewhat, but when the food was delivered, rather than continue to help, he decided to sit down and eat while the other two helpers and I continued moving stuff in. (This was 10 hours into the move.) That’s when I lost it. I yelled at him for not helping more. All he had done in his relationship with my daughter was go to work, come home and play video games. He didn’t help around the house or show any interest in helping with their son. Over the last few years, Harry has changed somewhat in helping with his son, but my daughter now feels stuck in the middle and wants me to apologize to him for yelling. I have made no disparaging remarks about him since. I even liked some of his posts on Facebook. I have gotten over it, but it seems Harry hasn’t. I told my daughter he needs professional help. The last time I visited, he stayed in a hotel for the weekend. My son says it should be an apology going both ways and should come from Harry first. What do you think? -- FAMILY DILEMMA IN CANADA DEAR FAMILY DILEMMA: Face it. Your daughter’s boyfriend is an overgrown child. Count your blessings that she isn’t married to him.

Strictly Come Dancing fans have same complaint as La Voix withdraws from show 'Pointless!',"Strictly Come Dancing fans have been left with the same question after it was announced La Voix has withdrawn from the competition. During Saturday (November 22) night's show, the remaining contestants took to the dance floor at the iconic Blackpool Tower Ballroom. Before things kicked off for Blackpool Week, presenter Tess Daly informed viewers that the drag queen – real name Chris Dennis – would not be returning to the competition after sustaining a foot injury. She said: ""We can confirm she has very sadly had to withdraw from the competition,"" before revealing there would be no elimination this weekend. But this has left fans wondering why Sunday night's show is still airing now that there is no dance-off. Taking to social media with their queries, one wrote: ""So what’s the point of Sunday’s show when everything can be done tonight #Strictly?""

An additional fan raged: ""They’ve announced nobody will be going home this week, yet they’ve said they’ll be speaking to La Voix in tomorrow’s results show. What results exactly? How about saving some license fee money and just not having a show rather than spaffing cash on an hour of filler?"" Someone else agreed: ""No one’s leaving Strictly this week.

Former finalists Danny Mac, Jay McGuiness, Ashley Roberts and Layton Williams will return to the dancefloor for a group routine at Blackpool, each revisiting one of their most famous Strictly moments. Tess and Claudia Winkleman will also receive an update from La Voix and her professional partner Aljaž Škorjanec following their departure. The TV star was granted a bye to next weekend after sustaining a foot injury, but was later informed that she would no longer be able to continue in the competition. In a statement, the 45-year-old said: ""With the guidance of the medical team and a heavy, heavy heart I have to officially withdraw from Strictly Come Dancing. What upsets me most is feeling like I’ve let my wonderful partner, Aljaž Škorjanec, down.""

NFL’s heaviest quarterback won Super Bowl ring and reached 560lbs before tragic death aged 38,"Jared Lorenzen will go down as a University of Kentucky great. The towering quarterback was a formidable presence at 6 ft 4in and 285lbs. His size and the fact he threw left-handed earned him the Hefty Lefty moniker as the NFL's heaviest ever quarterback. As a high school senior at Highlands in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, he racked up passing 3,393 yards, 45 touchdowns and six interceptions, adding 904 yards and 15 scores on the ground in a 15-0 season. It saw him land an offer from the University of Kentucky and the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award. Per ESPN, Unitas attended the presentation and told the youngster: ""You're awfully big to be a quarterback. I don't think you're going to amount to much of anything being that big."" Despite turmoil at head coach, by the time he left in 2007 Lorenzen held Wildcats records in total offense, passing yards, and passing touchdowns. ""He had such a quick release and such a strong arm, it was obvious to me,"" said Hal Mumme, who recruited him. ""Everything you could measure a quarterback by, he had. ""You just had to get past the fact that he looked like an offensive lineman."" For a man of his size, Lorenzen was blessed with a remarkable skill set. ""His stardom would've been colossal if social media existed when he played in college,"" fellow Kentucky quarterback Shane Boyd said. ""When you look at his stature and what he could do on the field, it was amazing to watch. It would've even been that much bigger now."" ""He was doing things a lot like Patrick Mahomes is doing now,"" added Mumme. ""In a lot of ways, I think Jared broke the ground for a lot of big guys who wanted to be quarterback. Cam Newton and others like that."" Lorenzen signed with the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent and by the 2006 season had won the job as Eli Manning's backup -- converting a QB sneak on third-and-one in his only play of the campaign. In the 2007 season, Lorenzen took over from the injured Manning in a game against the Dallas Cowboys to complete his first pass and watched the Giants stun the undefeated New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. After a brief spell with the Indianapolis Colts, where he tipped the scales at 303lbs, the passer played indoor football in the AF2, Ultimate Indoor Football League (UIFL), and Continental Indoor Football League from 2009, but his weight was a consistent issue. Lorenzen spoke to ESPN in 2014 and 2018 after an ankle injury that ended his playing career led to him hitting around 560lbs and receiving a warning from his doctor about his health. ""At first it was like, once I come back from this, once I can run again and feel better about my ankle, I gotta do something,"" he revealed. ""And then it was, man, it's cold now, and I can't really do much on it. I can walk, but it's like whoop, it inflates right away. But it's a double-edged sword. ""Yeah, it inflates because I probably have more weight on it than I should, and I need to lose the weight. Well, in order to lose the weight, I have to be able to work out. Which is, you know, what you're constantly fighting."" Ranking the top 10...... Quarterbacks of all-time - Can anyone better Tom Brady? Wide receivers of all-time - Does Randy Moss or Jerry Rice come out on top? Running backs of all-time - Stacking Jim Brown, Barry Sanders, Walter Payton, Emmitt Smith and more Tight ends of all-time - How does Travis Kelce compare? Lorenzen had two daughters with his high school sweetheart Tamara, but they divorced in 2013 after 18 years together. ""We're best friends. She's awesome,"" Jared says. ""But being divorced, that got me where it's just chomp-chomp-chomp-chomp. Who do I have to live for? Chomp-chomp-chomp."" He was determined not to give up and in 2017 he launched The Jared Lorenzen Project where he wrote about his battle with obesity. By 2018, he had lost over 100lbs. ""It turns out if you put your body through hell for about 15 years, it doesn't want to fight back,"" he told For the Win. ""I still have these dreams I can do what I used to and it's not necessarily true. I put my body through a little bit too much too fast and had to recover from it."" Tragically, the kind-hearted QB passed away a year later from an acute infection Dad Joe discussed his son's passing with Bleacher Report in 2019. ""I don't think he had any idea he was as sick as he was,"" he said. ""Everything was such a gradual progression. I knew what kind of pain he was in, but I don't think he had any idea that things were dire. As a parent, you lose sleep over that. ""For the rest of my life, I will have to wish I would've done something more."" Lorenzen brought a lot joy to the world before his death. ""I miss him so much,"" added his dad. ""But I couldn't be any prouder of who he was. ""I'm proud of his athletic accomplishments, but I'm prouder of the person he was. For wanting people to be happy.""

Asking Eric: I’m dreading family holiday parties this year as they’re bound to be filled with political complaining,"Dear Eric: With the holidays approaching, I’m facing a dilemma. Politically, I guess I’m a Libertarian because I am somewhere in the middle, not far left or right. That’s one reason I don’t like discussing politics, as most people who do are at one of the extremes. The other reason is it’s almost always a very negative narrative against the other side, rather than what they believe is positive about their own side. My dilemma is about Christmas. I’m from a very small family and have only a few cousins left. I’m invited each year to a cousin’s home for a lovely dinner party. I’m considering not going (i.e. staying home alone) this year because they are very liberal and very vocal about it. If I don’t chime right in with the Trump-bashing, which will be over the top this year, they accuse me of being a Trump supporter. (I have never voted for him.) I just don’t like the tone it sets at a festive time of year, and I choose not to participate. We’re getting older and it may be the last time I see some of them, but the political rants just squash the spirit of the season. I feel I can’t say anything because it’s their home and their party. How do you suggest I navigate this? – No Grinches Dear No Grinches: While it’s true that it’s their home, as a guest and as a family member, you can ask for what you need in order to feel comfortable and welcome. Start with a phone call. Tell them you value them and want to spend time with them, but that you find that the political debate wears on you and detracts from the holiday. Don’t get into the who-said-what of it all. For the moment, let’s leave voting records out of it. This is a conversation about how to have a conversation. Ask them if they’d consider focusing on family, connectivity and celebration this year. Now, some families connect and celebrate by debating. And maybe everyone in your family is like this, save for you. It’s still possible to modulate.

Cougs drop road matchup to No. 21 James Madison,"Much like Bill Murray’s character from “Groundhog Day,” the Washington State Cougars seem to be stuck in a loop. The last four WSU losses have each felt the same — a blown fourth-quarter lead, a few too many penalties and costly quarterback mistakes. Two uncharacteristic explosive plays allowed by the WSU defense and a stale second-half offense led the Cougars to a 24-20 loss to No. 21 James Madison on Saturday in Harrisonburg, Va. “We played well enough to win this game, we just didn’t,” WSU coach Jimmy Rogers said. “As I told the guys in the locker room, ‘One opportunity left to make this season, and be bowl eligible and have an opportunity to play with each other one more time,’ and I think that’s important.” The Cougars dropped to 5-6 overall and will next host Oregon State on Saturday in Pullman. The Beavers beat WSU 10-7 on Nov. 1 in Corvallis. Another stale second half Asked about WSU’s three-point second half compared to 17 points scored in the first, Cougar quarterback Zevi Eckhaus wanted to make one thing clear in his postgame news conference. “How many drives did we have in the second half?” Eckhaus said. “Three drives in the second half, one of which we started at the (WSU) 7-yard line. It doesn’t mean we can’t score, but it makes it a lot harder.” WSU punted on that first drive, scored a field goal to go up 20-17 on its second possession of the second half, then came up short on one final drive. JMU dominated the time of possession with nearly 35 minutes of offense. While the Dukes were scoreless on their second-half opening series, the drive drained almost 10 minutes off the clock. With a 17-10 halftime lead, the Cougars seemed to keep their offense conservative in an effort to drain the clock. That plan worked in a 20-3 win at Colorado State on Sept. 27 when the offense scored just three points in the second half, but JMU proved too good to let WSU get away with that. The Cougars opted to run the ball 16 times over their three second-half drives. It netted 35 yards. Facing fourth-and-5 at his own 45, Eckhaus’ pass bounced off of wide receiver Jeremiah Noga’s helmet and the Dukes got the ball back and got the final first down they needed to kneel out the clock and improve to 10-1. “Obviously, I would love to score 20 points in the first (half) and 20 points in the second. It just hasn’t been that way for us this season,” Rogers said. “Some of that is due to playcalling, some of that is due to lack of execution, some of that is due to penalties. So, we need to continue to get better. There’s nobody who feels like the blame is on them as much as I do and we need to be hungry to finish out the season.” Francl’s big day WSU linebacker Caleb Francl stuffed the Dukes on a fourth-and-1 attempt at the WSU 7 to halt a nearly 10-minute second-half opening drive. The senior linebacker also intercepted JMU quarterback Alonza Barnett III’s first pass of the day to set up WSU’s 3-0 first-quarter lead. Francl said that the Cougs had been working on getting a jump on balls in the air by reading the QB’s eyes and anticipating opportunities. The senior said he jumped on the first pass out of Barnett’s hands sooner than he may have earlier in the year. Francl made eight total tackles, five solo, and picked off a pass in an all-around excellent day for the South Dakota State transfer. Fellow SDSU transfers Matt Durrance and Tucker Large made eight and seven tackles, respectively, on a day in which the defense forced five consecutive stops and prevented points on six of JMU’s first seven drives of the game. Despite the overall stout defensive performance and the Cougars’ emphasis and ledger of limiting explosive plays, JMU scored two touchdowns off chunk plays. The Dukes cashed in on a 68-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter and a 58-yard rushing touchdown in the fourth to take a 24-20 lead with 6:24 left. Up-and-down QB play The Dukes’ defense lifted up their offense when junior cornerback Justin Eaglin jumped an errant Eckhaus pass intended for senior wide receiver Josh Meredith and returned it 37 yards for a touchdown and a 10-3 Dukes lead early in the second quarter. Eckhaus led the Cougars on two touchdown drives to cap the first half, finding Tony Freeman on a 48-yard pass to make it 10-10. On their next drive, Eckhaus dodged defenders on his way to a 4-yard rushing touchdown to complete a 10-play, 67-yard series that spanned nearly five minutes. The Cougars gained just 20 more yards after falling behind with 6:24 left in the fourth quarter. Eckhaus completed 19-of-31 passes for 171 yards with one passing touchdown, one rushing touchdown and an interception. “There were some plays in there that he made that were really special plays,” Rogers said of Eckhaus. “Obviously, I know he’s gonna want the turnover back and a couple throws that he’s gonna want back, but that comes with playing quarterback.” Eckhaus has thrown two touchdowns and five interceptions combined during WSU’s last three losses, all on the road: 22-20 to No. 18 Virginia, 10-7 to Oregon State and the four-point loss to James Madison. WSU fell one game below .500 and needs to beat Oregon State in its regular-season finale in order to secure a bowl game. “It’s not my last game as a Coug if we win,” Eckhaus said. “(If) we do our job, we give ourselves another opportunity to play and I think that a lot of guys deserve that opportunity.” No. 21 James Madison 24, Washington State 20 First Quarter WSU — FG Stevens 29, 8:06.

"US President claims Chicago crowd called to ‘bring in Trump’ after riot with 8 shot, 1 killed","US President Donald Trump on Saturday claimed that Chicago residents were calling to “bring in Trump” after a wave of violence in the city. His comments followed a Friday night riot in the Chicago Loop, where at least eight teenagers were shot, one fatally, and several police officers were attacked. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote that there had been “massive crime and rioting in the Chicago Loop area” and said that “multiple Police Officers [were] attacked and badly injured.” He stated that “300 people” were involved in rioting and that “6 victims” had been shot, with “one critical and one DEAD.” He criticised Governor Pritzker and Chicago’s mayor, alleging they were refusing federal assistance, and added that “the people are chanting, BRING IN TRUMP!!!” The disturbance erupted after a Christmas tree lighting ceremony near State and Randolph streets at around 10 pm on Friday, according to Fox 32 Chicago. Alderman Brian Hopkins of the city’s 2nd Ward said approximately 300 juveniles were involved, using mace and stun guns against officers. He confirmed that at least one officer was hospitalised. Among those shot were six children aged 13, 14, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Less than an hour later, a 14-year-old boy was shot and later died in hospital, while an 18-year-old man was also wounded. The unrest came only days after a separate incident in which a man with a lengthy criminal record was accused of setting a woman on fire aboard a Chicago train. Lawrence Reed, 50, is charged with committing a terrorist attack or other violence against a mass transportation system. Officials said he “had no business being on the streets.” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson described the train assault as an “isolated incident.” Records indicate Reed has been arrested at least a dozen times since 2017, with charges including felony aggravated arson and multiple battery offenses. Despite prosecutors seeking to keep him in custody, a judge released him with an ankle monitor.

"Carney looks to Mandela, trade pacts to help navigate 'this moment of rupture'","Prime Minister Mark Carney is welcomed by Paul Mashatile, Deputy President of South Africa, as he arrives to the G20 in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Saturday, Nov. 22, 2025. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick JOHANNESBURG - Prime Minister Mark Carney evoked the legacy of Nelson Mandela in praising efforts by fellow leaders to collaborate amid global volatility, as Canada sought more trade partners and promoted multilateralism at the G20 summit in Johannesburg. “At a time when too many countries are retreating into geopolitical blocs or the battlegrounds of protectionism, Canada believes that the G20 must remain a bridge,” Carney told reporters Sunday. He cited the legacy of former South African president Nelson Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison for his opposition to the apartheid system of racial segregation. Carney quoted Mandela as saying a societal renaissance required confronting problems that go beyond any one country. “His words spoke to a moment of rebirth in South Africa, and today they can guide how we lead the way forward, from this moment of rupture,” Carney said. He was speaking after most leaders of the G20 agreed to a joint declaration that touched on climate change and gender equality, despite U.S. President Donald Trump staging an American boycott of the Johannesburg summit. Carney saluted countries for releasing a joint document, noting it stems from “a very broad process that takes an entire year” and not just the final summit. He noted the governments who signed on represent three-quarters of global population, and two-thirds of the world’s economic output. “I look at it more from who shows up, who engages, who does the work,” Carney said. He said the American absence was “a reminder that the centre of gravity in the global economy is shifting,” with economic and political power being diffused toward multiple countries, including the Global South. “Our task is to ensure that Canada doesn’t only endure this shift, but that we prosper under it,” he said. At a formal bilateral discussion Sunday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he and Carney agreed to revamp negotiations for a trade deal, which have stopped and started since 2010. Carney told reporters a comprehensive deal would have a lot more benefit than the talks toward a sectoral agreement that Canada suspended in 2023 after the assassination of a Sikh activist near Vancouver. The prime minister also co-launched a partnership Saturday with India and Australia on emerging technologies. That same day, he was part of talks between the European Union and a Pacific Rim trade bloc called the CPTPP, which could boost trade between countries trying to escape coercive practices such as American tariffs and Chinese import bans. On Sunday, Carney announced that Ottawa and South Africa agreed to launch discussions for an investment-protection pact, aimed at getting companies in both countries to work together more on clean energy and the responsible sourcing of critical minerals. He also announced that FinDev Canada would open an office in Cape Town next year to advance the agency’s work supporting private sector-led projects in emerging countries. That might help South Africa with the large infrastructure projects it has been developing so far with the help of countries like China. The news came days after South Africa’s envoy in Ottawa told The Canadian Press his country was angling toward a “wine for gas” deal that would have his country sell higher-quality wines in Canada while importing liquefied natural gas. At the summit, Carney also spoke with Angolan President João Lourenço in his capacity as chair of the African Union, about “a possibility that we could work something out” in partnering with the continental free-trade area that is taking shape, but he said he didn’t want to “overplay” the idea. “Our new government is working for Canada, to move from reliance to resilience by building a broad and dense web of new partnerships, and creating new economic opportunities that will make Canada stronger both at home and abroad,” Carney said. But Carney’s visit comes amid mounting concerns over Canada’s engagement with Africa, where he spent roughly 48 hours in a visit to South Africa and no other country on the continent. On Friday, Canadian officials in Johannesburg announced Ottawa would for the first time ever cut back its support for the Global Fund, a major health organization that tackles infectious diseases like tuberculosis and HIV. That follows a cut to foreign aid in this year’s budget, which the government insists is meant to align Ottawa with spending that took place before the COVID-19 pandemic. In March, the Liberals released an Africa strategy that seeks to go beyond viewing the continent as an aid recipient, by preparing Canadian companies to profit from Africa’s young population and booming economies. But the Trudeau Liberals released the strategy after years of delays and just days before calling an election. Ottawa allocated no new funds to the strategy, while it set aside $2.3 billion for the 2022 Indo-Pacific strategy. Canada’s special envoy for Africa, Ben Marc Diendéré, told the Senate on Oct. 30 that the strategy is hindered not just by the lack of clear funding, but because he has “had to fight to get people to say the word ‘Africa’” with the department. When asked about those comments Sunday, Carney said Africa is part of Canada’s diversification push. “Is it the first thing we worked on in terms of priorities? No,” he said. “That’s because we have a responsibility to have that highest return. Canada remains engaged with Africa.” Carney said Canada needed to focus first on deepening the strong ties Ottawa already has with economies such as Mexico, the U.K. and in Europe “to move them to the next level.” What followed was progress with high-growth Asian markets where Canada could secure “immediate results,” such as the newly signed Indonesia trade deal. “It’s still a priority; it’s one of the big continents,” he said in French. Carney also held an informal discussion Sunday with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and was part of a Saturday meeting of European and Japanese counterparts who urged Washington to revise its initial peace proposal for Ukraine, which echoed much of Russia’s demands. The South African hosts highly restricted access to bilateral meetings on both days of the summit, blocking Canadian media from attending all of the engagements Carney held at the summit site.

Peak Trump?,"Only the very brave or the very foolish would predict the political demise of Donald Trump. This is a US president who, over the course of his five-decade career, has escaped multiple brushes with bankruptcy, survived two impeachments in his first term, faced 91 criminal charges and been convicted on 34 of them, survived two assassination attempts, lost an election in 2020, yet was still able to return to office this year more powerful than ever. Even so, it is reasonable to ask whether, in light of recent events, we may have passed peak Trump. Of course, assuming Trump cannot find a way to circumvent the US Constitution and stand for a third term, it was always inevitable that he would see his powers wane in his final two years after next November’s midterm elections. But the heavy defeats suffered by the Republican Party in elections across America this month suggest he may be prematurely approaching lame duck status. Not only did it lose in places as different as New York, Virginia and Georgia, but the scale of defeat was much greater than polls had predicted. Investors are now betting that there is a 71 percent chance that the Republicans lose the House next year, according to Polymarket. The irony is that what turned voters against Trump was the very thing that had helped propel him back to the White House: the high cost of living. Voters blame the president for the rising cost of groceries, even as Trump claims they are falling. Some 76 percent of voters view the economy negatively, according to a poll for Fox News last week. That’s worse than the 70 percent who said the same at the end of former President Biden’s term. The same poll found that 58 percent of voters now disapprove of how Trump is doing his job, compared to 41 percent who approve. Only once has he scored lower, in October 2017 in his first term. Equally ominous for Trump are the growing splits in his MAGA movement. Last week, he was forced to back down after months of trying to block the release of the Epstein files when Republican members of Congress refused to drop their support for a bill that would force the Department of Justice to release all the information it holds on the convicted paedophile. Previously, he had called Marjorie Taylor Greene, until now one of his earliest and most loyal supporters, a “traitor” for leading the effort in Congress. The split within the Republican movement goes beyond Epstein. MAGA supporters accuse the president of spending too much time on foreign affairs rather than domestic issues. They regard his interventions in Iran, Gaza and now Venezuela as contrary to America First principles. They accuse the administration of being too welcoming to foreign labor. At the same time, traditional conservatives are outraged by the willingness of far-right MAGA influencers such as talk-show host Tucker Carlson to embrace antisemitic provocateurs such as Nick Fuentes. Meanwhile, there are other signs that Trump’s grip on all the institutional levers of power may be slipping. The Senate earlier this month voted to repeal punitive tariffs on Brazil and Canada, a sign that Trump’s enthusiasm for tariffs is not shared by all Republicans. Republicans in Indiana refused to obey Trump’s demand to gerrymander constituency boundaries to improve the party’s chances of retaining control of the House of Representatives next year. At the same time, the Supreme Court cast doubt on the legality of Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, raising the prospect that his signature policy could be ruled unconstitutional. Trump could be in even greater trouble if the AI bubble in the stock market were to burst or deeper problems were to emerge in the vast and opaque private credit market. This risk appears less imminent in the wake of last week’s strong earnings from chipmaker Nvidia and better-than-expected employment data. But with spending on AI data centers now accounting for nearly all US growth and valuations at dotcom bubble levels, investors are rightly nervous. Given the scale of American savings invested in the stock market, a dotcom-style crash could wipe two percentage points off GDP, the International Monetary Fund has warned. The good news for Europe and the rest of the world is that a weakened Trump may be more cautious about doing anything that might undermine the US and global economy ahead of next year’s midterm elections. That may lead him to restrain his more impulsive instincts. He has already backed down over his trade war with China and last week agreed an outline trade deal with Switzerland. Other deals with countries previously in his firing line may follow. One sign that Trump recognizes his vulnerability is that he last week canceled tariffs on 200 agricultural items, an implicit admission that tariffs do push up inflation and are paid by Americans. On the other hand, even a lame duck Trump can still inflict considerable damage over the next three years. There seems little chance that he will abandon his transactional approach to foreign policy, bullying friend and foe to accept one-sided deals. What’s more, Trump is sure to go to extreme lengths to ensure the Republicans win next year’s elections, using his powers of pardon to shield those engaged in criminality, as he did with those convicted of the January 6 riots. Even if we have passed peak Trump, we are unlikely to have passed peak danger.

"Who Is Ali Tabatabai, Hezbollah Deputy Chief That Israel Killed In Beirut Strike?","Israel carried out one of its most aggressive strikes inside Beirut in years, killing Hezbollah’s deputy chief and top military commander, Ali Tabatabai. The operation, conducted deep inside the Lebanese capital, was the first major Israeli strike since the November 2024 ceasefire and the first time the Israeli Air Force targeted a senior Hezbollah figure since the ceasefire. It was the fifth Israeli strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs since a ceasefire agreed in November 2024 after a year of conflict, and comes a week before Pope Leo XIV is scheduled to visit Lebanon. In the past, Israel had regularly targeted mid-level Hezbollah operatives in southern Lebanon, especially those accused of attempting to rebuild rocket-launch sites or infiltrate the border region. Ali Tabatabai was born to an Iranian father and a Lebanese mother. According to Haaretz, he was not among Hezbollah’s founders but belonged to its “second generation"". He was deployed in Syria and Yemen to support allied forces in both conflict zones. Israel’s military said Tabatabai joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and went on to hold several senior roles, including in the Radwan Force, the group’s elite combat unit. The US State Department designated him a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in 2016 and announced a $5 million bounty for information on him. According to the department, Tabatabai oversaw Hezbollah’s Radwan Force operations in Syria and Yemen. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said he was responsible for strengthening the group’s military capabilities and overseeing its rearmament. During last year’s war, Tabatabai headed Hezbollah’s operations division and rose further in rank as several senior commanders were killed, the Israeli military added.

Sunbury continues on,"Club Sunbury continued its good form with another strong performance in the Bowls Victoria weekend pennant, division 1, section 1 competition on Saturday. Sunbury was on the road against Deer Park 2 and was up to the challenge as it came away with an 86 (16)-73 (2) win. Sunbury’s David Glennon said they were pretty happy with that result. “It was a good win against one of the stronger sides that are up there,” he said. “They were just behind us in third spot. If they had won they would have leap frogged us. “There’s now a bit of a buffer between us and them.” Mark Armstrong’s rink was the standout on the day winning 27-13, while Lee Wesley’s rink won 26-15. Marc Bullows’ rink snuck home 21-20, while Desmond Cann Jnr’s rink was the only one to go down, losing 25-12. “To get 16 points at Deer Park is very good,” Glennon said. “Not many teams will get that many points playing at Deer Park. “It’s a hard place to go and get the win.” Glennon said Armstrong was one of the standouts for the side, while Lauchlin Davies had a good day in Bullows’ rink. With a few players missing, including Sophie Kurzman who is representing Victoria, there were a few different faces out there for Sunbury. Glennon said despite that they still had a fairly stable side. “We had two or three different changes,” he said. “That happens and we were still able to get the win in what I thought would be a really tough game.” Sunbury remains in second place and is 14 points behind runaway leaders Whittlesea, which are undefeated after five rounds. Sunbury’s second side in division 2 came away with a draw against Keilor to move into the top four. The club’s two division sides also got wins on weekend and are on top of the ladder. “It’s been a really good season for the club so far,” Glennon said. The top side will this Saturday face Yarraville Footscray 2. The Bulldogs sit in fifth spot, just outside the top four. Glennon said it would be another good test for the side. Meanwhile in the Ballarat Highlands Bowls Region’s Highlands division 1 competition, Kyneton and Kyneton Golf continued their good form. Golf got the win against Lancefield, 63 (14)-47 (2).

Top Ecommerce Stocks Worth Watching – November 23rd,"Posted by Michael Walen on Nov 23rd, 2025 Walmart, GameStop, GigaCloud Technology, Pattern Group, and WM Technology are the five Ecommerce stocks to watch today, according to MarketBeat’s stock screener tool.

"Arkansas football notebook: KJ Jackson's performance, punt placement, point differential","AUSTIN, Texas — Redshirt freshman KJ Jackson earned praise from interim coach Bobby Petrino, a longtime quarterback guru, and his teammates for his relief role in Saturday’s 52-37 loss at No. 17 Texas. Jackson played his most meaningful snaps as a Razorback after starter Taylen Green came out with apparent tightness in his hamstrings early in the third quarter. Even after Green was cleared to return, Petrino opted to stick with the left-hander, who directed a field goal drive in his first series then a pair of touchdown drives in the final 11 minutes after Texas built a 52-23 lead. Petrino was asked what most impressed him about Jackson’s performance, which included 16-of-29 passing for 206 yards and a touchdown. “Number one, he was really executing the offense, doing what you want him to do,” Petrino said. “(He) made good decisions. I thought he threw the ball pretty well, pretty accurate, mixed it around. “When he came in, he got all the tight ends, running back, (the) receivers (involved). … Usually when you’re doing that, you understand the defense, and you take what they give you, and you’re not trying to force anything.” MORE FROM WHOLEHOGSPORTS | 4 takeaways from Arkansas football's loss at Texas in Week 13 Jackson broke a couple of tackles on a 12-yard touchdown run with 7:46 remaining to cap a 75-yard sequence, then found Jaden Platt for an 8-yard touchdown pass to complete a 92-yard drive. Jackson was in on four possessions that resulted in 271 yards over 42 plays and 17 points. The only non-scoring drive came on a strip-sack that Texas linebacker Liona Lefau scooped for a 52-yard touchdown. “I was happy with the way he played, except for the turnover, obviously, but one heck of a run for a touchdown,” Petrino said. Senior tailback Mike Washington said the 6-4, 225-pounder from Montgomery, Ala., entered with confidence and played with confidence throughout his stint. He also discussed Green’s response. “He spoke to KJ, obviously, letting him know, like, he’s going to be good,” Washington said. “(That) he’s going to do good out there. He kept his head up.” Top scores Despite being seven games below .500 at 2-9, the Razorbacks are still outscoring their opponents 378-375 on the season. The point disparity is reflective of the Razorbacks dominating their first two opponents — Alabama A&M and Arkansas State — by a combined 108-21 count, followed by a nine-game losing skein that featured six one-score losses. Opponents have outscored Arkansas 354-270 during the current nine-game losing streak. Taaffe truck Washington’s 22-yard touchdown run in the second quarter not only included a good burst to swing around the left edge but also a big-time broken tackle. Texas safety Michael Taaffe, a preseason All-American and finalist for the Burlsworth Trophy, was in position to stop Washington around the 10-yard line but the 228-pound back lowered his shoulder, dumped Taaffe and finished the run to the end zone. ABC announcer Joe Tessitore and analyst Jesse Palmer both used the term “trucked” to describe the collision. “It felt good,” Washington said. “It felt real good. It gave me like a boost of adrenaline.” Washington surpassed the 1,000-yard mark for the second on the big gain and is now at 1,020 yards. Wraparound Texas pulled off a 10-point swing to straddle halftime that allowed it to turn a one-point lead into an 11-point advantage early in the third quarter. After a 21-yard Devin Bale punt that was judged to have gone out of bounds at the Arkansas 35 with 50 seconds left in the second quarter, the Longhorns moved only 9 yards — still enough for Mason Shipley to boot a 44-yard field goal on the final play of the half. The Longhorns received the opening kick in the third quarter and launched a quick, five-play touchdown drive sparked by back-to-back Arch Manning passes of 30 yards to Emmett Mosley V and 35 yards to tight end Jack Endries to take a 31-20 lead. “I thought the field goal at the end of the first half was really important, knowing we were going to get the ball to start the second half,” Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said. “Really, that was, those 10 points to end the first half and start the second half. I thought were huge.” 50-plus FGs Freshman kicker Scott Starzyk’s 51-yard field goal to open the scoring was his second of 50-plus yards this season for Arkansas, joining his career-best 53-yarder in the season opener. The Razorbacks have now gone four consecutive seasons with multiple made 50-yard field goals. Cam Little did it with a pair in 2022 and four in 2023, then Matthew Shipley, the brother of current Texas kicker Mason Shipley, made two in 2024. Starzyk made a career-high three field goals against the Longhorns while Mason Shipley converted a 44-yarder at the halftime buzzer on his only try. Short punt Arkansas’ Devin Bale averaged 41 yards on his two punts, but they were wildly different: a 61-yarder and a 21-yard shank that veered out of bounds but hugged the sideline and bounced only about a yard out of bounds around the Texas 40. Officials ruled it crossed the sideline in the air at the Arkansas 35, leading to a Texas field goal to end the first half. “I think it went out of bounds on that angle and it wasn’t a good situation,” Petrino said. “So when I looked up and saw it, I was glad [the official] stopped where he did stop.” Stat chat Arkansas will enter the season finale ranked No. 11 in total offense with 473.8 yards per game and No. 124 in total defense, allowing 432.3 yards per game. As of Saturday night, the Razorbacks were 1 of 9 teams in the nation that averaged more than 30 points per game (34.4) and also allowed more than 30 per game (34.1). They rank No. 23 in scoring offense and No. 124 in scoring defense. Arkansas is No. 20 in rushing (203.8), No. 27 in passing (270.0) and No. 44 in passing efficiency. The Hogs are No. 101 in rush defense (173.5), No. 121 in passing yards allowed (258.7) and No. 123 in pass efficiency defense. In other strong statistical areas, Arkansas is No. 15 in third-down percentage (48.8%), No. 19 in red-zone scoring (91.3%) and No. 12 in net punting (52.5). In other weak statistical areas, the Razorbacks are No. 128 in turnover margin (-1.09), No. 122 in third-down defense (45.0%), No. 129 in fourth-down defense (71.4%), No. 101 in penalties per game (7.0) and No. 102 in penalty yards per game (62.1).

"After Monterey Park shooting, these Trojans helped a shattered city heal","Thomas Wong (left) and Paul Lee joined fellow city officials to organize community events that bring people together after the 2023 mass shooting. (Photo: Lance Ignon) On the night of Jan. 21, 2023, a 72-year-old man armed with an illegal semi-automatic pistol walked into a dance studio in Monterey Park and killed 11 people. Another nine were seriously wounded. It remains the deadliest mass shooting in Los Angeles County history. Nearly three years later, two graduates of the USC Price School of Public Policy are working to heal the community’s collective trauma. They’ve joined with their fellow city officials and non-profit organizations to hold community events to bring people together. Access to mental health services has increased, including the provision of counseling at community events. And they’re collaborating with other cities and agencies to help them try to prevent mass shootings. “We’ve been working with non-profit groups, like Chinatown Service Center and others, to provide opportunities for people who want to be able to process these things or to seek help to be able to do so,” said Thomas Wong, a member of the Monterey Park City Council who graduated from the USC Price School in 2013 with a Master of Public Administration (MPA). On a recent sunny Saturday morning, technicians were setting up a sound system on the edge of a grassy park next to the Monterey Park City Hall. By the evening, DJs would be playing House music and other genres of electronic dance music for nearby residents. The event, the Electric Park Festival, is designed to build community. It’s one of several similar initiatives led by Paul Lee (MPA, 2019), the volunteer Chair of the Monterey Park Parks and Recreation Commission. The festival drew 500 people when it launched in March 2023. About 4,500 showed up to this year’s installment. While the festival was all about music and fun the first couple of years – and still is – it’s now also part of the human gravity that is pulling the community back together. “I’ve been … super encouraged by the fact that people have been wanting to show up … to support the community and support each other,” Wong said. “In our time of need and one of the darkest moments … (the) community has been coming together, really shown a lot of resilience.” But the memory of that night can never be papered over. “It was rough,” Lee said, recalling the night of the shooting. “I remember it was around 11:30 at night when messages started coming in my group chat, ‘Hey, Paul, … There’s something happening in Monterey Park.’ And I was like, ‘No way this is true.’ The way I cope with things, I just had to go there myself. So, I went out there (to the scene of the shooting) and … I remember thinking, ‘This can’t be happening.’ It really hurt.” Master of Public Administration Online Advance your career and the institutions you serve with our exceptional MPA online. After his killing spree in Monterey Park, a city of 61,000 people about nine miles east of downtown Los Angeles, the gunman drove to nearby Alhambra but was disarmed before fleeing in his car. He shot and killed himself the next day as police closed in. “I think a lot of us were just in a state of shock that something like that could happen and it would happen here,” Wong said. “It’s like, there’s no playbook. No one’s prepared for this.” It came as such a shock in part because Monterey Park was – and is – a safe community, with an overall crime rate lower than the state and national averages. “You always read about it and it’s like, ‘Oh, it’s somewhere else.’ And yeah, it’s a horrible thing, but it’s not here,” Wong said. “You don’t expect it to happen here in your backyard.” More than 65% of Monterey Park’s residents are Asian. The community is lush with Asian restaurants and other businesses. But Wong and Lee noted that many Asians are reluctant to seek mental health services. “There’s still a stigma,” Lee said. Which is why community events have played an outsized role in healing the community. “Having people around you who make you feel like you belong, that sense of community, means a lot. It allows you to rely on others when tragedy strikes, but also to share your wins along the way,” Lee said. “That really goes a long way.” Stay informed with our newsletter!

Practicing gratitude can have profound health benefits,"It’s a Thanksgiving tradition in many U.S. families, but you might be surprised to learn that the simple exercise can have dramatic benefits. For those who can resist diving into the turkey and mashed potatoes for a few minutes to share their thanks first, evidence indicates that gratitude can boost health and well-being. “Benefits associated with gratitude include better sleep, more exercise, reduced symptoms of physical pain, lower levels of inflammation, lower blood pressure and a host of other things we associate with better health,” said alumnus Glenn Fox. An expert in the science of gratitude at USC Marshall School of Business, Fox is head of program design, strategy and outreach at the USC Performance Science Institute. Fox earned his Ph.D. in neuroscience while working at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ Brain and Creativity Institute. “The limits to gratitude’s health benefits are really in how much you pay attention to feeling and practicing gratitude,” he said. You might get a warm glow from expressing gratitude once a year at Thanksgiving. To truly derive long-lasting benefits, though, experts say you should make it a part of your daily or weekly routine. Scientific evidence from gratitude research backs up a few typical approaches, including saying thanks to people who don’t expect it and writing down a few things each day that make you grateful. “It’s very similar to working out, in that the more you practice, the better you get,” Fox said. “The more you practice, the easier it is to feel grateful when you need it.” Fox first started researching gratitude as a doctoral student at USC Dornsife. Some people scoffed at his interest in the emotion, which had received little attention from researchers. But he pressed forward with what would become the first study of how gratitude manifests in the brain. He found links between gratitude and brain structures also tied to social bonding, reward and stress relief. Other studies have bolstered his findings, revealing connections between the tendency to feel grateful and a chemical called oxytocin that promotes social ties. Research on gratitude has also found associations with other health benefits, including general well-being, better sleep, more generosity and less depression. Fox said it makes sense that gratitude is beneficial from an evolutionary perspective. “Gratitude is such a key function of our social lives and our evolution as a species,” he said. “People who did not develop gratitude or grateful relationships with others, it’s very unlikely they would have survived in a social context.” So what are some proven techniques to becoming a more grateful person? Fox said gratitude research has shown that some of the most effective approaches include maintaining a gratitude journal, penning personal thank-you notes and regularly expressing gratitude to others in person. Fox suggested experimenting to find the method that works best. Stick with something for a few weeks and note any improvements in how you feel. For him, spending a few minutes each day before winding down for bed is the most effective approach. He might write in his gratitude journal, practice guided meditation, call someone to express thanks or write a note to a friend. “It helps create a buffer and helps me sleep a little better,” he said. “It’s not that you’ll never have a restless night again or you won’t feel stressed. The whole point is that, for that time, you’ve spared yourself a little bit of the anxiety of the day.” As for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, Fox said there’s no wrong way to practice gratitude. Going around the table to share thanks, writing positive messages to others or simply taking the time to connect with friends and family are all good ways to get started. “What other holiday is built on recognizing things we are grateful for?” he said. “I just don’t think you can go wrong.”",2025-11-24 08:05:00,University Of Southern California,positive,0.8277,47,Simwa_Better_Flag," Evidence indicates that gratitude can boost health and well-being .

Arkansas football looking to end season on positive note following Texas defeat,"AUSTIN, Texas — The Arkansas football team (2-9, 0-7 SEC) had a bit more time to process a 52-37 loss to No. 17 Texas on Saturday compared to weeks past. For starters, Arkansas didn’t hold a fourth-quarter lead like in its most recent losses to Auburn on Oct. 25, Mississippi State on Nov. 1 and LSU on Nov. 15. The Longhorns (8-3, 5-2) led 45-23 to begin the fourth quarter. Texas defensive end Colin Simmons and linebacker Liona Lefau teamed up for a strip-sack fumble and 52-yard touchdown on the recovery with 11:30 to play. The blindside hit on Arkansas backup quarterback KJ Jackson left no doubt in a ninth straight loss, despite two late touchdowns by the redshirt freshman. Arkansas’ attention now turns to an ongoing coaching search, which is reportedly nearing its end, and a home finale Nov. 29 against No. 22 Missouri at Reynolds Razorback Stadium. “There’s not a lot left, you know,” Arkansas interim coach Bobby Petrino said. “The message is, we’ve got 30-some kids that will walk on senior day and they’ve got one left. They’ve put a whole bunch of investment into this game of football for their entire life. Let’s do it better next week — for one more week — and go out there and compete as hard as you possibly can.” The loss was no different from the ones to other ranked SEC teams, such as No. 20 Tennessee on Oct. 11 and No. 3 Texas A&M on Oct. 18. The Razorbacks’ offense and defense never synergized. Arkansas produced points on its first four drives to cut Texas’ lead to 21-20 with 7:24 left in the second quarter. The last two ended in touchdowns. Then, the Razorbacks’ warmed-up offense vanished with back-to-back three-and-outs, while their defense forced two Texas punts. “The third down got us,” Petrino said. The Razorbacks got the ball back on their 39 with 6:46 left in the second quarter. They stood 14 yards closer to the end zone than when they reached it a minute prior, during an 11-play, 75-yard touchdown drive which ate 5:02 off the clock. Arkansas quarterback Taylen Green threw an incompletion to Raylen Sharpe on third-and-5 from the Arkansas 44, which started a streak of three straight for Green, who finished 10 for 20. “The throw was high and then (Sharpe) said that he looked back and the sun was there,” Petrino said. “It’s unfortunate because we got the play we wanted. We got the matchup we wanted. I thought we had a first down and we just don’t execute it. That’s kind of the story of the year, where we have things there. And all of a sudden we don’t execute them or make mistakes.” The Hogs have been defined by a failure to finish in 2025. That includes tackling, such as linebacker Xavian Sorey Jr. getting an arm around Texas quarterback Arch Manning and being shrugged off. MORE FROM WHOLEHOGSPORTS | Notable stats, PFF grades from Arkansas football's Week 13 loss at Texas The botched sack happened near the first half’s two-minute timeout on second-and-6 at the Arkansas 39. It didn’t affect the score as the Longhorns punted, but the whiff didn’t make Manning, who totaled six touchdowns, any more uncomfortable during a career day. Saturday’s game in Fayetteville will be a chance for Arkansas to make up for fourth-quarter leads it has yielded. The Razorbacks started the fourth quarter at Missouri with a 14-10 lead in last year’s regular-season finale, but the Tigers snatched a 28-21 win. “Just keeping the team together for this last week and making sure no one checks out,” redshirt senior defensive tackle Cam Ball said. “We still have one game. Anything can happen. At this point — not even at this point — we’re playing for pride. We want to send the seniors out the right way. We have a lot of seniors in that locker room who deserve to go out with a bang.” Arkansas ended 2024 on a higher note with a 39-26 win against Texas Tech in the Liberty Bowl. It won’t have that chance in 2025 amid a 2-9 season. Petrino could see a few Razorbacks wavering on the sideline at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium. “For the first time, I felt like there were a couple of guys on the team that’s attitude wasn’t where it needed to be,” he said. “That’s not what we are. Not what we want. Got a whole bunch of guys in the room that have one more game left. I asked them if they would make sure that we finish practicing correctly and get ready to play … work as hard as we can to get a win at home.” Ball, one of six team captains, didn’t need convincing to take on the responsibility. “It’d mean the world to me,” he said of beating Missouri. “I’ll treat it like my Super Bowl.” Support journalism that covers the topics that matter most to you.

Warrant: argument led to Waffle House shooting,"Brown According to an arrest warrant, a shooting at a Cookeville Waffle House last week allegedly occurred during an argument between the suspect and two others. Derrick J. Brown, 40, was arrested Nov. 18 and charged with two counts of aggravated assault and possession of a weapon by a felon. The arrest report by Cookeville Police Department Det. Cary Matheney said that witness statements detailed that an argument began when the two alleged victims exited the South Willow Avenue restaurant with a group of friends while Brown was talking on his phone. ""As the group of friends passed (Brown), they overheard a numeric term being spoken,"" Matheney said. ""Them victim made a comment about the numeric term and the verbal confrontation started when the suspect took offense."" Matheney said video surveillance at the Waffle House allegedly showed Brown and the two individuals ""exchanging words"" in the parking lot. At one point, he said Brown allegedly produced a handgun from the waist of his pants and pointed it at the victims. ""Both individuals backed away and the suspect put the gun back into his waistband,"" Matheney said. ""The group was witnessed in a verbal dispute when the suspect again drew his pistol, pointed it at both and discharged one round into the victim's chest."" The report said the shooting victim was transported to Cookeville Regional Medical Center before being transferred to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in critical condition. Matheney said following the shooting, Brown fled on foot. According to a CPD press release on Nov. 18, the shooting took place just after midnight and police began a search for Brown. He was eventually arrested at approximately 10:44 a.m. the same day. He was booked into the Putnam County Jail on a $525,000 bond.

"Trump’s rhetoric may have escalated insecurity in Nigeria, Omojuwa tells US senator","He added that he did not share the notion that Nigerian Christians feel reassured by Trump’s offer of protection from “persecution”. Omojuwa offered his perspective while posing a question to Kevin Cramer, US senator, at the three-day Halifax International Security Forum in Canada. Omojuwa is a member of the Halifax Forum board. Before the influencer’s comments, Cramer said Christians in Nigeria today are probably feeling “pretty good” about Trump’s position. Trump had threatened to send US troops “guns-a-blazing” into Nigeria, a country he called “disgraced”, to wipe out the “Islamist terrorists” he said were killing Christians. In a clip of his response to Cramer shared on X on Monday, Omojuwa said he offered a different view because he speaks as a Christian living in Nigeria. “I do not feel good about Donald Trump. He called Nigeria a disgraced country. Frankly speaking, that’s not so bad, because he used to call us a shit hole country. So it’s a kind of improvement,” Omojuwa said. He followed by asking if powerful nations could offer assistance more respectfully, and without doing so in a way that leaves others worse off. “For instance, America went to Libya. Libya has a causative effect on the terrorism challenges Nigeria and the Sahel are facing. I don’t want to talk about the other places America went to. Let’s just take it to Nigeria,” he added. “Since Donald Trump said what he said for Nigerian Christians, Christians have been abducted in the church in the north-west of Nigeria. “Muslim students have been abducted. I do not speak to the causation but there’s a correlation from the point Donald Trump spoke about Nigeria’s challenges and the escalation of terrorism. “So decency apart, there are rules of engagement, there’s a rules based global order. Is there a way to speak about Nigeria, first of all, in a respectful, decent way, not even just as president of America, but as a human being?” Omojuwa also pointed to the failed arms deal between the US and Nigeria as playing a role in the weakened fight against terrorism. “Is there a way to decently help Nigeria without making things worse and without disrespecting Nigerian Christians and Muslims?” he asked. The US senator replied in the affirmative. “The right words help. A more delicate way of saying something is obviously better than a more brutal way,” Cramer said. “A lot of people will say the right thing and do the wrong thing. Other people will maybe say the wrong thing and mean to do the right thing. Is there a better way to say? Certainly.” However, the senator said he believed that foreign aid assistance would be more effective in stemming terrorism, noting that he had publicly disagreed with Trump multiple times on the aid cuts. “I think, globally speaking, aid to friends, and would-be friends, and possible friends is a bargain compared to munitions,” he said. Cramer also posited that assistance would need to suit local contexts.",2025-11-24 20:08:00,Nigeria News,neutral,0.6204,41,Concern_Decades_Security," Omojuwa offered his perspective while posing a question to Kevin Cramer, US senator, at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada .

"US judge tosses cases against ex-FBI chief Comey, New York AG James","FILE PHOTO: Former FBI Director James Comey testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 8, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/File Photo WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A federal judge on Monday dismissed criminal charges against two perceived adversaries of President Donald Trump, FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling the U.S. attorney he hand picked to prosecute them was unlawfully appointed. The ruling throws out two cases Trump had publicly called for as he pressured Justice Department leaders to move against high-profile figures who had criticized him and led investigations into his conduct. Lindsey Halligan, a former personal lawyer to Trump, was named interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in September to take over both investigations despite having no previous prosecutorial experience. The findings by U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie came after both Comey and James accused the Trump Justice Department of violating the U.S. Constitution's Appointments Clause and federal law by appointing Halligan in September. 'NO LEGAL AUTHORITY' Currie found that Halligan ""had no legal authority"" to bring indictments against either Comey or James. But Currie dismissed the cases ""without prejudice,"" giving the Justice Department an opportunity to seek new indictments with a different prosecutor at the helm. ""All actions flowing from Ms. Halligan’s defective appointment,"" Currie wrote, were ""unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside."" After the decision, Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters the Justice Department would ""be taking all available legal action, including an immediate appeal to hold Letitia James and James Comey accountable for their unlawful conduct."" Bondi said that because Halligan was made a special U.S. attorney, she can continue to prosecute cases. ""She can fight in court just like she was and we believe we will be successful on appeal,"" Bondi said. James and Comey separately said they were grateful for the ruling. James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, said she would ""continue to challenge any further politically motivated charges through every lawful means available.” In an Instagram video, Comey said the case against him ""was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence and a reflection of what the Department of Justice has become under Donald Trump."" It is unclear if prosecutors could seek to bring a new case against Comey over the same conduct. The five-year statute of limitations on the charges expired on September 30, and Comey's lawyers have already indicated in court filings that they do not believe prosecutors have more time to refile the charges. Both Comey and James have been longtime targets of Trump's ire. Comey as FBI director oversaw an investigation into alleged ties between Trump's 2016 election campaign and the Russian government and later called Trump unfit for office. James, an elected Democrat, successfully sued Trump and his family real estate company for fraud. Trump ordered Bondi to install Halligan to the post after her predecessor Erik Siebert declined to pursue charges against Comey or James, citing a lack of credible evidence in both cases. HALLIGAN MOVED SWIFTLY Shortly after her appointment, Halligan alone secured indictments against Comey and James after other career prosecutors in the office refused to participate. Comey pleaded not guilty to charges of making false statements and obstructing Congress after he was accusedof lying about authorizing leaks to the news media. James pleaded not guilty to charges of bank fraud and lying to a financial institution for allegedly misleading on mortgage documents to secure more favorable loan terms. Attorneys for Comey and James argued that Halligan's appointment violated a federal law they said limits the appointment of an interim U.S. attorney to one 120-day stint. Repeated interim appointments would bypass the U.S. Senate confirmation process and let a prosecutor serve indefinitely, they said. Siebert previously had been appointed by Bondi for 120 days and was then re-appointed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, since the Senate had not yet confirmed him in the role. Lawyers for the Justice Department argued the law allows the attorney general to make multiple interim appointmentsof U.S. Attorneys. Still, Bondi sought to shore up the cases by separately installing Halligan as a special attorney assigned to both prosecutions. In that same document, she also said she ratified the indictments. Currie found that Bondi's attempts to retroactively secure the cases were invalid. Currie, who is based in South Carolina and was appointedby former Democratic President Bill Clinton, was assigned to rule on Halligan's appointment because federal judges in Virginia had played a role in appointingher predecessor. The challenge to Halligan's appointment was one of several efforts lawyers for Comey and James have made to have the cases against them thrown out before trials. Both also argued that the cases are ""vindictive"" prosecutions motivated by Trump's animosity. Halligan has come under intense scrutiny by courts, particularly over her handling of the Comey case. A federal magistrate judge found she may have made significantlegal errors in presenting evidence and instructing the grand jury that indicted Comey. The trial judge repeatedly questioned whether the full grand jury had seen the final version of the Comey indictment. (Reporting by Andrew Goudsward and Sarah N.

Netflix’s ‘The Herd’ sparks controversy over portrayal of Fulani herders,"A new Nollywood crime thriller ‘The Herd‘ has ignited a fierce online debate, with critics accusing it of unfairly stereotyping Fulani herders as terrorists. The film, directed by Daniel Etim-Effiong, recently became available on Netflix. Its plot follows a couple whose wedding day in south-west Nigeria turns into a nightmare when their celebratory convoy is ambushed by gunmen disguised as cattle herders. The story quickly shifts from a joyous celebration to a brutal fight for survival. However, the movie’s central conflict has drawn significant criticism on the social media platform X. Prominent voices, including former presidential aide Bashir Ahmad, have condemned the film for what they call “a dangerous profiling of an ethnic group”. In a lengthy post, Ahmad argued that the scene depicting the attack “paints a picture that is dangerously inaccurate”. He expressed concern that the stereotyping fuels suspicion and violence against innocent Fulani people and could create an international stigma against the entire community. Ahmad concluded by calling on the Nigerian Film Corporation, led by Ali Nuhu, to investigate the film.

A.J. Brown talks about the reasons for the loss to the Cowboys and 'winks' at Jalen Hurts,"The Eagles' wide receiver spoke a lot and a little at the same time in a postgame interview following Sunday's loss in Dallas Although the Philadelphia Eagles remain atop the NFC East standings and among the top teams in the NFL, last Sunday's loss to the Cowboys gave the team and coaching staff plenty to reflect on. One of them was wide receiver A.J. Brown, who, in his comments and opinions, seemed to point to Jalen Hurts as one of those responsible for the result. The reigning Super Bowl champions were leading 21-0, which angered many fans and others for squandering such a comfortable advantage. But above all, it raised questions about what's going wrong: is it Nick Sirianni as head coach, is it Hurts as quarterback, the offensive and defensive coordinators, or a combination of both? NBC Philadelphia reporter Ashlyn Sullivan shared Brown's message on X: ""A.J. Brown pointed to the Cowboys' second-half defensive adjustments to explain why the Eagles struggled on offense, along with self-inflicted injuries. He pointed to himself making a false start and said he needed to get on the same page."" Brown emphasized Dallas' defensive changes, saying Philadelphia never responded. Although he briefly acknowledged a false start of his own and said he needed to ""get on the same page,"" his tone suggested the real problem stemmed from the offense's inability to respond-a criticism aimed squarely at Jalen Hurts. He didn't mention Hurts by name directly, but the message was crystal clear. Following the loss to Dallas at AT&T Stadium, the Philadelphia Eagles' star quarterback spoke to the media. ""There are a lot of situations where it's showing up, and we've been able to overcome it and force ourselves to win,"" said Hurts. ""Tonight, we didn't. We played a very tough first half, and in the second half, we were nowhere near our level. We have a lot to learn, and we have a short week to react,"" he stated. We have a lot to learn, and we have a short week to react After taking a 21-0 lead, the Eagles fell to 8-3 with their 24-21 loss to the Cowboys on Sunday in Arlington, Texas. Hurts completed 13 of 17 passes for 157 yards with a touchdown in the Eagles' first three series, then 3 of 9 passes for 26 yards in the next five series, and then 11 of 13 passes for 106 yards in the final three series.",2025-11-24 20:07:58,Marca Claro,neutral,0.5315,0,Loss_After_Career," Philadelphia Eagles' wide receiver A.J.

Suddenly, it became much easier to get information on where in the world the site’s users are actually posting from, theoretically helping to illuminate inauthentic behavior, including attempted foreign influence. “It is clear that information operations and coordinated inauthentic behavior will not cease.” As the tool started to reveal accounts’ information, the effect was like watching the Scooby Doo kids pull one disguise after another from the villain off the week. Improbably lonely and outgoing female American GI with an AI-generated profile picture? Apparently based in Vietnam. Horrified southern conservative female voters with surprising opinions about India-Pakistan relations? Based somewhere in South Asia. Scottish independence accounts? Weirdly, many appear to be based in Iran. Hilarious and alarming though it all was, it is just the latest indication of one of the site’s oldest problems. The tool, officially unveiled on November 22 by X’s head of product Nikita Bier, is extremely simple to use: when you click the date in a user’s profile showing when they signed up for the site, you’re taken to an “About This Account” page, which provides a country for where a user is based, and a section that reads “connected via,” which can show if the account signed on via Twitter’s website or via a mobile application downloaded from a specific country’s app store. There are undoubtedly still bugs—this is Twitter, after all—with the location indicator seemingly not accounting for users who connect using VPNs. After users complaints, late on Sunday Bier promised a speedy update to bring accuracy up to, he wrote, “nearly 99.99%.” As the New York Times noted, the tool quickly illuminated how many MAGA supporting accounts are not actually based in the U.S., including one user called “MAGA Nation X” with nearly 400,000 followers, whose location data showed it is based in a non-EU Eastern European country. The Times found similar accounts based in Russia, Nigeria, and India. While the novel tool certainly created a splash—and highlighted many men interacting with obviously fake accounts pretending to be lonely, attractive, extremely chipper young women—X has struggled for years with issues of coordinated inauthentic behavior. In 2018, for instance, before Musk’s takeover of the company, then-Twitter released a report on what the company called “potential information operations” on the site, meaning “foreign interference in political conversations.” The report noted how the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin-backed troll farm, made use of the site, and uncovered “another attempted influence campaign… potentially located within Iran.” The 2o18 report was paired with the company’s release of a 10 million tweet dataset of posts it thought were associated with coordinated influence campaigns. “It is clear that information operations and coordinated inauthentic behavior will not cease,” the company wrote. “These types of tactics have been around for far longer than Twitter has existed—they will adapt and change as the geopolitical terrain evolves worldwide and as new technologies emerge.” “One of the major problems with social media is how easy it is to create fake personas with real influence, whether it be bots (fully automated spam) or sockpuppet accounts (where someone pretends to be something they’re not),” warns Joan Donovan, a disinformation researcher who co-directs the Critical Internet Studies Institute and co-authored the book Meme Wars. “Engagement hacking has long been a strategy of media manipulators, who make money off of operating a combination of tactics that leverage platform vulnerabilities.” Since 2018, X and other social media companies have drastically rolled back content moderation, creating a perfect environment for this already-existing problem to thrive. Under Musk, the company stopped trying to police Covid misinformation, dissolved its Trust and Safety Council, and, along with Meta and Amazon, laid waste to teams who monitored and helped take down disinformation and hate speech. X also dismantled the company’s blue badge verification system and replaced it with a version where anyone who pays to post can get a blue checkmark, making it significantly less useful as an identifier of authenticity. X’s remaining Civic Integrity policy puts much more onus on its users, inviting them to put Community Notes on inaccurate posts about elections, ballot measures, and the like. While the revelations on X have been politically embarrassing for many accounts and the follower networks around them, Donovan says they could be a financial problem for the site. “Every social media company has known for a long-time that allowing for greater transparency on location of accounts will shift how users interact with the account and perceive the motives of the account holder,” she says. When Facebook took steps to reveal similar data in 2020, Donovan says “advertisers began to realize that they were paying premium prices for low quality engagement.” The companies “have long sought to hide flaws in their design to avoid provoking advertisers.” In that way, X’s new location tool, Donovan says, is “devastating.”",2025-11-24 20:07:58,Mother Jones,positive,0.8717,26,Belongs_Preserved_Resigned," X social media platform rolled out a new “location indicator” tool last week .

TUESDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK: Can the WSU offense finish the season strong?,"COMMENTARY Through WSU’s last three losses, including its 24-20 fall to now-No. 20 James Madison on Saturday, the Cougars have scored six total points in the second half and lost by a combined nine points. Wazzu’s second-half sorrows have been systemic, with the Cougars scoring just over one-third of their total points (85-of-227) in the second half of all 11 of their games. WSU offensive coordinator Danny Freund worked with Rogers for one year at South Dakota State. The 2024 Jackrabbits ran a run-heavy offense that enjoyed the services of current Iowa quarterback Mark Gronowski. Those Jackrabbits scored 550 total points, a top-five mark in the FCS. So, why has the staff not been able to replicate that same success at WSU, similar to how the WSU defense has emerged as one of the nation’s most underrated units? Yes, for Freund, this is his first taste of the FBS level and the Cougars’ schedule has been ridiculously difficult. Eight of the Cougars’ 11 opponents are bowl eligible and four of their opponents are currently ranked in the AP Top 25 poll. That is all true for WSU defensive coordinator Jesse Bobbit, too. Bobbit has the advantage of bringing 10 defenders, including six starters, with him from South Dakota State. Aside from his running back room, of which there are three SDSU transfers, Freund’s personnel has been almost entirely new to him, with an offensive line largely recruited by the last two coaching staffs and a quarterback in Zevi Eckhaus, with 11 interceptions to his name. Beyond personnel, the Cougars have exhibited somewhat stale playcalling in the second half — an opinion shared by WSU head coach Jimmy Rogers. “At times, we’ve gotten away from things inside of games that we’ve had success,” Rogers said. “On Saturday, we went into half at 226 total yards. We are having success running the football. We were having success in the air; we just kind of got stagnant, and they did a good job of stopping some of the things that we had done early on in the game. And nobody’s more frustrated than (Freund), as far as the lack of production that we’ve had in the second half of games. And we just need to continue to stay aggressive and trust in our players, and not just expect things to happen.” The Cougars got just three offensive drives in the second half, of which they garnered three points. Thanks to a nearly nine-minute opening-half drive from James Madison, it had been almost an hour since Eckhaus and the Cougar offense had stepped onto the field. Trailing WSU by seven points at halftime, the Dukes emerged from intermission with some offensive firepower. Through 10 running plays and four passes, the Dukes drove 68 yards before WSU linebacker Caleb Francl extinguished a flaming drive on fourth-and-1 from the WSU 7 with a tackle that permitted no gain. The Cougar defense had once again done its job. Now, with 6:43 left, the WSU offense faced a difficult task. Gain yards. Starting from the 7-yard line, making any sort of significant gain would at least take the pressure of a potential JMU short field off the table. With their backs 7 yards from the end zone, the Cougars opted to run the ball four straight times. The first two carries from running back Kirby Vorhees up the middle gained zero and one yard, respectively. The third carry garnered 10 yards and a first down. WSU netted a loss of 2 yards over the next three plays — a run, a pass and a run — and punted. JMU whipped out a 68-yard touchdown pass on the very first play of its next possession to tie the game 17-17. WSU ran the ball on seven of its next nine plays to retake the lead, but another explosive play from JMU, this one a 58-yard touchdown run from Wayne Knight, gave the Dukes a lead they would not relinquish at 24-20. WSU gained just 20 more yards in the final 6:43 of play. WSU persisted on running the football in an attempt to ice the game, even when it was garnering not even a yard on a consistent basis. JMU had adjusted to WSU’s attack and the Cougars did not present much else to throw JMU off its scent. On WSU’s final drive, down four, JMU knew that the Cougars had to pass as the clock wound down, so they effectively prevented any hope of a productive drive. Rogers said he wants to see the offense have answers for the second-half adjustments that defenses make against them. “So having answers and creating answers — that part, I wish we (would have) done a better job of, and I put that just on me as much as anything else,” Rogers said. When millions of dollars is at stake, sometimes tough — even brash — decisions are made personnel-wise when on-field performance falls short. Freund has not demonstrated an ability to be aggressive enough in his playcalling, leaving Rogers to say that the Cougs will be more aggressive in his media statements week after week. For this inconsistency between Rogers’ words and the offenses’ actions, Freund may not be WSU’s OC next year. While the Cougars have not been able to build an offense — from the offensive line to the passcatchers to the QB himself — that necessarily suits the vision that Rogers and Freund have for their offense, the defense, with handpicked personnel establishing a clear unit vision, has achieved great things this year. The Cougar offense that finished recent home victories over Toledo and Louisiana Tech with long touchdown drives is perfectly capable of showing up on Saturday to beat Oregon State. However, it is worth noting that Rogers said senior center Brock Dieu is “doubtful” to play. Wazzu has not been able to weather injuries to its offensive line that well. If the offense can finish the season strong against Oregon State and play well in a potential bowl game, Freund may return with another offseason to recruit and build the unit that he wants with personnel he can trust.

William Garza,"Birth: 1953 Death: 2025 Bill Garza was a good guy. Not only a good guy, a great guy. As in, “My buddy Garz (as he was referred to by many a childhood friend) will be there. He’s a good guy, you’ll like him.” And the other says, “Oh you know Garz!? He’s a great guy!” Yes, Bill Garza was of that rarified air, that upper crust that gets elevated from good guy to great guy in conversation. There are a select few members of this hall of fame and Garz was certainly one of them. Born and raised in the Sunset district of San Francisco, CA, he attended St. Gabriel’s grammar school (’67) and Sacred Heart (’71). At Sacred Heart he found a love for baseball, specifically pitching. He used to say pitching a baseball game was the closest thing you could get to being a matador. From his teenage years until his mid-thirties, he threw thousands of pitches to catcher’s gloves that rarely moved. Many of those pitches were thrown to his buddy Mike Fegan who preceded him to that final game in the sky. Bill loved nothing more than being with his children. Although Bill is one of the few people in the history of basketball to be kicked out of a game — by his own coach — he managed to teach good sportsmanship when he coached his kids in baseball and basketball. A dedicated Dad, Bill took his kids to baseball games (of course), many trips to Tahoe and Santa Cruz, and to see weird movies. He taught his kids to be “Bill Early” to the movies. That is, 30 minutes before showtime. Whether going for a walk, seeing a new movie, an A’s game, a Shark’s game, or trying a new restaurant, it didn’t matter. Nothing made him happier than spending the day with his kids. All he ever wanted from his kids was for them to be happy. He showed that with his unwavering, unconditional support. If his kids were with him, he was a happy man. Though his love of baseball may be attributed to his father Hugh, his pleasant, southern disposition and love for a chat he got from his mother Betty. Both traits served him well during his time with FedEx. A proud employee and driver for FedEx for over 40 years, thanks to Betty, he never shied away from a conversation and connection. At FedEx, he had many opportunities to connect with others earning Bill something more important than the many awards he received, lifelong friendships. Bill couldn’t help making friends wherever he went, and had more lifelong friends than the average person has acquaintances. He was always ready with a story to tell about his many escapades with his friends. Bill was always planning that next dinner, that next trip to Mexico, the next fantasy baseball or football draft. Bill could talk to his friends for hours, whether on the phone at home, on a walk along the Benicia waterfront, or on a roadtrip to see AA baseball, he was always happy around these people he loved. There are too many to name, but Ed, Larry, Dave, Buck, Bruce, Paul, Glenn and Moose were amongst his closest friends. Bill was fortunate enough to marry the love of his life, Peggie, later in life, and his love and generosity knew no bounds as he took in all of Peg’s grandkids as his own. Easily becoming their favorite of the grown-ups, always receiving the first acknowledgment and hugs as “Grandpa Bill”. He is survived by these many great admirers and loved ones including his children Maddie, Paul and Noelle, his wife Peggie, his sisters Judy and Lynn, and nieces and nephews Christina, Alisha, Michael, Vanessa, Jesse, and Malachi. Though no one is perfect (he was a Dodger fan), Bill was as close as you can get. His love, his generosity, his laugh, his smile, will forever be honored and cherished in our hearts. We hope he’s enjoying well-earned rest and relaxation: watching the derby and sipping a Mint Julep with his mom, or a game of catch with his dad. Until we take the field together again, we will continue the game in his honor. Services will be held in his honor on December 6th, 2025, at the United Irish Cultural Center of San Francisco from 11 am to 3 pm. Afterwards, feel free to gather at the Twin Peaks Tavern in his honor.

What age should I tell my kids Santa isn't real - and how to explain it gently,"Christmas is fast approaching, and while kids around the world are excitedly writing their letters to Santa and counting down the sleeps until the big day, others may be showing signs that their belief in Father Christmas is beginning to wane. But how do you broach the topic with your children, and when should you be honest about Santa? As a mum to a very perceptive five-year-old who already surprises me with endless questions about how Father Christmas gets around the world in one night, this is a topic I've been thinking about already, and I don't always know how to answer on the spot. To help, I reached out to Lesley Lasker, a Parent Education Specialist and founder and clinical director of Lasker & Associates, a Therapy Collective, to share all the details on what age to tell children that Santa isn't real, and how to explain it to them gently without ruining the magic of Christmas. The age at which children begin to question Santa can vary a lot, for many reasons, as Lesley explains: ""Children all reach the developmental milestone of deciphering between reality and fantasy at different ages depending on their maturity, sibling order and social circumstances. Typically, the shift happens between seven to ten years of age. Some children may not want to lose the magic (or presents), so they choose to believe longer intentionally."" There may be a few signs that your child is ready to learn the truth about Santa, including asking lots of questions about his magic. ""It is important for parents to watch for signs that their child is developmentally ready to hear the truth and reality of Santa. Other children in the family or schoolmates may say things that cause your child to question what they know about Santa,"" Lesley says. ""You will know that your child is ready for the conversation when you begin to hear questions repeatedly and with genuine curiosity. They may ask how Santa and the reindeer are able to fly, how Santa gets down the chimney or is able to reach homes around the world in just one night. This is likely the time to have the conversation. We want our children to know that we will always tell them the truth. This builds a foundation of trust."" You may have already recognised that it's time for 'the talk', but how exactly should you go about explaining the truth to your child? These are the five tips to consider, according to the parenting specialist. Children will all react differently, and Lesley says it's important to ""validate and normalise"" their feelings. ""Some children will experience sadness over learning the truth about Santa. It is important to validate and normalise those feelings. You can say, 'Lots of kids feel this exact way when they learn that Santa isn't real. It is ok to feel sad learning that something you have believed in for so long is not real'. Let your child know that you are okay with their feelings and they can come to you with all feelings, all the time,"" she says. You may be worried that telling your child the truth about Santa will put an end to the magic and excitement of Christmas, but it doesn't have to be this way. Thinking about new ways to include them in the celebrations and traditions can help ease the transition, according to the parenting specialist. ""There are many ways to let your child know that they can still be a part of the Christmas magic as a bigger child. They are now in on the secret and can keep the magic alive for the younger children in their lives. Enlist their ideas of special ways to bring Santa's joy to kids who still believe in Santa,"" Lesley says. ""Assign your child the task of placing the gifts from Santa in the special place where Santa left their gifts. Include your child in the traditional ways that you portrayed Santa for them while they believed. Let your child be creative and involved in creating the magic of Santa for others. This will help your child launch into the next developmental phase with confidence and a sense of belonging. It helps them feel big and grown up while still keeping ties to the holiday that they love so much.""",2025-11-25 08:05:00,Hellomagazine,neutral,0.4995,-1,Outlier," The age at which children begin to question Santa can vary a lot, for many reasons .

"Ukraine makes significant changes to US ‘peace plan’, sources say","Ukrainian head of presidential administration Andriy Yermak, left, and US Secretary of state Marco Rubio, right, talk to the press as their consultations continue at the US Permanent Mission in Geneva, Switzerland on Sunday. Picture: Martial Trezzini/Keystone via AP Ukraine has significantly amended the US “peace plan” to end the conflict, removing some of Russia’s maximalist demands, people familiar with the negotiations said, as European leaders warned on Monday that no deal could be reached quickly. Volodymyr Zelenskyy may meet Donald Trump in the White House later this week, sources indicated, amid a flurry of calls between Kyiv and Washington. Ukraine is pressing for Europe to be involved in the talks. The original 28-point US-Russian plan was drawn up last month by Kirill Dmitriev, Vladimir Putin’s special envoy, and Trump’s representative Steve Witkoff. It calls on Ukraine to withdraw from cities it controls in the eastern Donbas region, limit the size of its army, and not join Nato. During negotiations on Sunday in Switzerland – led by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak – the plan was substantially revised. It now includes only 19 points. Kyiv and its European partners say the existing frontline has to be the starting point for territorial discussions. They say there can be no recognition of land seized by Russia militarily, and that Kyiv should make its own decisions on whether to join the EU and Nato – something the Kremlin wants to veto or impose conditions on. Ukraine’s first deputy foreign minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, told the Financial Times such issues had been “placed in brackets” for Trump and Zelenskyy to decide upon later. Read MoreRussia launches deadly attacks on Kyiv despite holding peace talks with US On Monday, Mr Zelenskyy said: “As of now, after Geneva, there are fewer points, no longer 28, and many correct elements have been incorporated into this framework,” adding that sensitive issues were to be discussed with Mr Trump. Rubio hailed Sunday’s talks as “very, very positive”. Writing on Truth Social on Monday, Mr Trump, who days earlier had accused Ukraine’s leadership of having “zero gratitude”, also struck a positive tone. “Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!” he wrote. Ukraine’s delegation briefed Mr Zelenskyy about the talks on Monday after returning to Kyiv from Geneva. They described the latest version of the plan as more realistic. Separately, Mr Zelenskyy spoke to the US vice-president, JD Vance, and urged him to involve European countries in the process. Mr Vance reportedly agreed. But in the clearest sign yet, the original 28-point plan – widely seen as favourable to Moscow – still falls short of several key Kremlin demands, Mr Putin’s top foreign policy aide on Monday said Moscow would seek to “rework” parts of it. “We were given some sort of draft … which will require further reworking,” said Yuri Ushakov, adding that “many provisions” of the plan appeared acceptable to Russia, but others would “require the most detailed discussions and review between the parties”. Underscoring the Kremlin’s hardline stance, Mr Ushakov said Moscow would reject a European counter-proposal from the weekend, which, according to a copy seen by Reuters, changes the meaning and significance of key points concerning Nato membership and territory. “The European plan, at first glance … is completely unconstructive and does not work for us,” he said. As negotiators scrambled to revise a framework, Ukraine and Russia counted casualties on Tuesday morning after trading deadly overnight strikes. Russia’s acting governor of Rostov region said at least three people were killed by Ukrainian strikes. Authorities in Kyiv said at least one person was killed and seven were wounded in the capital, after a barrage of missiles and drones targeted the country’s energy sector. The UK and EU were blindsided last week when the original plan was leaked to US media. The army secretary, Dan Driscoll – Mr Vance’s friend and university classmate – was sent to Kyiv with a military delegation to brief Mr Zelenskyy on its contents. Since then, European governments have sought to revise the document, which appears to have originally been written in Russian. EU leaders attending an EU-Africa summit in Angola welcomed a degree of progress, but said far more work remained to be done and insisted Europe must be fully involved, and Russia must be present if talks were to advance substantively. The European Council president, António Costa, praised “a new momentum”, saying after talks on the sidelines of the summit that while issues remained, “the direction is positive”. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, also called the “refined peace framework” agreed in Switzerland “a solid basis for moving forward”, but added: “Work remains to be done.” Ms Von der Leyen said the core principles the EU would always insist on were that “Ukraine’s territory and sovereignty must be respected – only Ukraine, as a sovereign country, can make decisions regarding its armed forces”. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said both Europe and Russia must be fully involved. “The next step must be: Russia must come to the table,” Mr Merz said, while Europeans must be able to give their consent to “issues that affect European interests and sovereignty”. Talks would be a “long-lasting process”, and Mr Merz said he did not expect a breakthrough this week. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said the talks were delicate because “nobody wants to put off the Americans and President Trump from having the US on our side in this process”. Mr Tusk also stressed that any peace settlement needed to “strengthen, not weaken, our security” and must not “favour the aggressor”. Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said Russia “must be forced to the negotiating table” to see “aggression … never pays”. Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, said there was more work to do, but progress was being made. A group of countries supporting Ukraine – the coalition of the willing – would discuss the issue in a video call on Tuesday, he said. The chairs of the parliamentary foreign affairs committees of 20 European countries, including France, Ireland, Poland, Spain and the UK, issued a rare joint statement saying just and lasting peace would not be achieved by “yielding to the aggressor” but must be “grounded in international law and fully respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty”. On Monday, the White House pushed back against criticism, including from within the Republican Party, that Mr Trump is favouring Russia. “The idea that the US is not engaging with both sides equally in this war to bring it to an end is a complete and total fallacy,” the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters. Mr Zelenskyy is at his most vulnerable since the start of the war, after a corruption scandal led to two of his ministers being dismissed, while Russia makes battlefield gains. -The Guardian Read MoreRussia launches deadly attacks on Kyiv despite holding peace talks with US Get full digital access for €3 a month.

TUESDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK: Coach Ford’s challenge: Keep Idaho’s core and fix the cracks,"COMMENTARY The Idaho Vandals’ 2025 season is officially over. Now we move over to the transfer portal, staff changes and recruiting in the offseason. Coming off a 4-8 season, it may be a little more difficult for Idaho coach Thomas Ford Jr. to snag the exact top transfers he wanted. Lots of players want to join squads they know will contend. Let’s take a look at some of the changes that might happen. I expect the Vandals to move on to a different offensive coordinator. On Saturday, Matt Linehan was on the sideline instead of the booth and was without a play sheet in hand. After the game, I asked Ford straight up: Who was calling the plays? “That’s really not a question that I feel comfortable talking about, really,” Ford said. “I mean, we have an offensive coordinator, and that’s all I’ll say.” He mentioned earlier in the presser that Linehan did a great job of “coaching the quarterbacks.” Defensive line coach Tevita Finau announced that he was moving on from the Vandals. Probably expect a few more changes in the coaching staff. There are a few top prospects on the Vandals that could be on the move, including junior linebacker Dylan Layne, true freshman cornerback Caleb Ricks, sophomore defensive end Matyus McLain and a number of others. Redshirt freshman gadget quarterback Rocco Koch already announced he is leaving the Idaho program and so did sophomore wide receiver Davis Fry. Keep in mind, the changes that haven’t already been announced are all speculation. I have no sources saying that these changes are going to happen; it’s all speculation on my part. Ford said he had a firm message for certain guys who may be teetering on a change of scenery. “I think the message is clear for these guys,” Ford said. “‘Hey, we were so close with so many of you guys that were inexperienced. You don’t have that problem in Year 2.’ A lot of these guys are first-year, even guys that were like older players, third-(and) fourth-year players were first-year starters. And so my message to those guys is, ‘Hey, let’s band together and show the world what we’re really about. If we stay together as a group and we continue to build on what we’ve really accomplished this season, the sky’s the limit for this program.’” He said most of the group gets the message. Building something with guys who have experience now, which they didn’t have at the start of the season, will be crucial. “And I don’t think you can get the same overall athletic experience you can in a lot of other places that you can here,” Ford said. “I know that these guys truly love being around each other. So my hope and my message to those guys is (to) stay together. You love these guys, and if we stay together, we can be pretty special.” Ford said after the game that the Vandals have 18 high school players committed and 16 of those are three-star players. He said in terms of stars, it could be one of the best recruiting classes in the history of the program. After those guys officially sign their national letter of intent to play for Idaho, the work moves on to transfer players. Ford said compared to last year, signing transfers will be much easier because they need about 10 players instead of 30 like last year. “So we’ve got some needs there, but the difference between this year’s transfer recruiting and last year is very different,” Ford said. “We needed like 30 guys last year and this year with a much smaller number, I think we can be very selective and get the right guys that we really need to improve the program.” This is what Ford said the program needs: a tight end, a couple of running backs, a couple of defensive ends, a safety, a cornerback and a wide receiver or two. Losing both Elisha Cummings and Nate Thomas to graduation, it makes sense that the team needs to get a few more running backs in the portal. With Ford being a former running back himself and running backs coach for a while, Idaho would be an attractive spot for some of those backs. Wide receiver was a weak spot for the Vandals for most of the season. The need to grab a few more playmakers on the outside is huge. Just for depth, the other spots will need to be filled. Mixing in a new D-End with Donovan Parham graduating and a possible McLain departure would be crucial. The same thing goes for cornerback; Deuce Blenman and Zakhari Spears are graduating and depth will be important to the Vandals next season. After the loss to Idaho State on Saturday, Ford told the players in the locker room that he aims to grind in the offseason. “What I said to them is, ‘You’re not going to see a coach in America that’s going to work harder than me,” Ford said. “‘You’re not going to see a recruiting group of guys that are going to hit this offseason as hard as our guys will.’” For the Vandals to bounce back and find production like they did in recent years. The hard work is going to have to come to fruition. No putting the foot on the brake — give it all gas.

Strictly Come Dancing star breaks silence after concern fifth contestant would quit,"Strictly Come Dancing's Alex Kingston is poised to carry on with her dance adventure, putting to rest concerns she might have to withdraw due to injury. The 62-year-old actress had triggered concerns about a potential exit after her daughter disclosed a rib injury on social media, stating that her mother had endured the discomfort to participate in Saturday's programme. The Doctor Who legend, who has been dazzling audiences on the dance floor alongside partner Johannes Radebe, was swift to comfort her supporters that injuries were simply ""part and parcel"" of the Strictly experience, and she had absolutely no plans to retire her dancing shoes. Fleur East, host of Strictly spin-off It Takes Two, has now verified that Alex will return to the competition following last week's Blackpool special. Discussing their forthcoming performance, Fleur disclosed: ""Alex and Johannes will be dancing a cha-cha-cha to Ring My Bell by Anita Ward."" We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. You can unsubscribe at any time. Read our Privacy Policy She continued: ""They'll be hoping they can ring in some matching and cha-cha-charm us this weekend."" This development comes after an Instagram post from Alex's daughter, Salome, who posted a video of her mum's Couple's Choice routine to a medley of History Repeating by Propellerheads and Look At Me by Geri Halliwell. She wrote: ""So so proud! ! ! Slayed on the dance floor, dislocated rib and all!"" After supporters expressed their concerns, Alex shared on Instagram that she was ""completely fine"" herself. In a statement, she reassured fans: ""I just want to assure everyone that I am completely fine. It is a minor injury... it's all part of dancing at these levels. ""The comment was made by my concerned and loving daughter...nothing more. I will be on the dance floor as early as tomorrow morning... rehearsing. Super excited for next week! Cha cha cha [dancer emojis]."" This follows a series of unexpected departures from Strictly this season, with four stars already having to bow out. Before the live shows even kicked off, Game of Thrones actor Kristian Nairn had to step down due to medical advice, while Love Island's Dani Dyer was unable to take part after breaking her ankle. They were replaced by Lewis Cope and Amber Davies. Later, it was announced that Neighbours star Stefan Dennis would have to withdraw due to an injury, while on Saturday, La Voix had to pull out, resulting in no elimination last weekend. The Drag Queen shared her disappointment on her social media platforms: ""I'm absolutely devastated to withdraw from Strictly Come Dancing. ""This isn't the glittering exit I ever imagined, and it breaks my heart to feel like I'm letting people down.

"US 'cannot defeat Venezuela', Maduro says amid tensions with Washington","Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro defied the U.S. on Tuesday, saying that Washington “cannot defeat"" his country, which he said is “invincible” amid the escalation of tensions in the southern Caribbean. Speaking on a television program, Maduro thanked “everyone who has courageously supported” Venezuela in recent weeks. “Despite the psychological and political warfare we have been subjected to for months, we are receiving an indescribable amount of support messages,” he said. The remarks came a day after the U.S. designated the Venezuela-based Cartel de los Soles – which Washington alleges is run by Maduro and senior officials – as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The move followed a significant U.S. military buildup in the region, including the deployment of an aircraft carrier strike group and F-35 fighter jets. Tensions between the two countries have risen sharply since U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a military deployment to the Caribbean in August, citing the need to target drug cartels and disrupt trafficking routes Washington claims are linked to Maduro. Caracas has rejected the allegations, calling the terror designation “ridiculous” and saying the so-called organization “does not exist,” accusing the U.S. of seeking a pretext to justify intervention and force regime change. At the United Nations, spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the global body is monitoring developments with “grave concern.” Responding to questions about the U.S. designation of the alleged cartel, Dujarric said the U.N. has “no position on that unilateral decision by the United States.” He warned that “increasingly confrontational rhetoric” risks heightening regional tensions and said all member states must “fully comply with their obligations under international law.” Secretary-General António Guterres continues to urge all sides to pursue dialogue and “find a peaceful way forward,” he added. U.S. military activity in Latin America has expanded in recent months, with the deployment of Marines, warships, fighter and bomber aircraft, submarines and drones. While some reports suggest Washington is preparing military options, Axios reported that Trump has told advisers he intends to speak directly with Maduro. Maduro has reiterated that Venezuela is prepared for a “face-to-face” dialogue with Washington. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, on Wednesday, will visit the Dominican Republic, a close U.S. Caribbean ally, for talks on combating drug trafficking amid a standoff between Washington and Venezuela, officials said.

Marquis Who's Who Honors Sue Pellegrino As A Top Entrepreneur,"Date About Ms. Pellegrino Ms. Pellegrino is an expert in accounting and business management. Throughout her career, she has held positions that utilized her skills, such as accounts payable supervisor, chief financial officer and income tax accountant. When an opportunity was presented to Ms. Pellegrino to take over an eDiscovery (electronic discovery) business, she was intimidated, though intrigued. She had experience in paper discovery, but didn't have any in eDiscovery, which largely concerns identifying, collecting, reviewing and producing electronically stored information (ESI) for litigation and investigations. ""Take chances. You're going to fail. No big deal. Get back up, try again. You want to be successful, you have to dive in. You can't just sit there and say, 'I'm not successful,' and you haven't done anything,"" Ms. Pellegrino says. She overcame her trepidation about being seen as a novice in eDiscovery and committed to learning about the field. Ms. Pellegrino received guidance from industry veterans, attended industry events and sought out resources. Ms. Pellegrino educated herself until she was capable of securing clients independently, which she calls a personal milestone. Ms. Pellegrino has continued her commitment to expanding her knowledge. One of her most significant accomplishments, she shares, is achieving ISO (International Organization for Standardization) certification for her company. These standards are set to ensure quality, safety, efficiency and consistency across industries. Ms. Pellegrino says it was a steep learning curve, but her leadership guided her team through the ""rigorous certification process."" The certification has to be renewed every three years and there are yearly audits to ensure compliance. This was a major achievement for Ms. Pellegrino, the team and the company, as ISO certification demonstrates the highest commitment to data security protocols and is a major differentiator and benefit to her clients. Keeping an Open Door Over the years, Ms. Pellegrino has developed a leadership style where she remains true to herself while also establishing boundaries between work relationships and those outside the job. Although she works remotely, she maintains an ""open door policy"" where her team members can contact her via email and phone, even on weekends. She makes certain that her team knows they can approach her and not be intimidated by her position as the owner of the company. ""Sometimes, people think you're a business owner, and you're so polished, and you have to act a certain way or be a certain way. I'm me. I don't change the way I am just because I'm a leader or a business owner. I just want people to know that you have to be yourself. You don't have to fit. There's not one mold to fit. You don't have to fit a mold. Be yourself,"" Ms. Pellegrino says. As the industry evolves, Ms. Pellegrino aspires to grow Everest Discovery LLC and has plans for expanding its services and her team. Recently, the company added data breach response and artificial intelligence to its list of services and she is exploring reducing reliance on external vendors in order to boost profitability.

Fabrizio Romano confirms Liverpool contract offer to key star,"We’ve seen reports that Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain are all interested in adding the Frenchman on a free transfer at the end of the season. And the stopper will be free to discuss terms with potentially interested overseas teams come January. That means Liverpool are running out of time to tie down their defensive lynchpin - with a contract offer currently sitting in front of him. The club have extended a deal towards Konate - according to Fabrizio Romano - contradicting the player’s claims that no such offer had been received. But the Italian transfer supremo has claimed that Liverpool are waiting on a response from Konate to their latest offer. “Look for Konate what we can say is that Liverpool and Konate agents remain in direct contact,” Romano tells his Here We Go podcast audience. “So there is a conversation ongoing. “Liverpool made their proposal to Konate. So there is a proposal on the table to extend the contract to basically sign a new deal with Liverpool. “There is a negotiation ongoing. Now it is on Konate to decide whether he wants to continue at the club or if he wants to try a new chapter and move probably out of England and try something different. “We know about the interest of Real Madrid, for sure.

Marathon trial almost over for former Kitchener doctor accused of assaulting female patients,"Waterloo Region Courthouse. Final arguments are underway in the marathon trial of former Kitchener doctor Jeffrey Sloka, who has pleaded not guilty to assaulting 41 female patients while examining them. Sloka’s position is that he had a medical purpose for all his conduct, and that without proof of a sexual purpose, he must be acquitted. “Doctors touch people. Physical examinations are inherent parts of what they do,” defence lawyer Jill Makepeace told Justice Craig Parry. “There are legitimate medical reasons for doctors touching intimate parts of the body.” The prosecution contends Sloka took sexual advantage of patients with medical problems who were desperate for answers. “These 41 women were put into a position by a person, who was their neurologist, where he took opportunities to touch their bodies in a sexual way,” prosecutor Teresa Donnelly said. “Many of the women felt their sexual integrity was violated,” prosecutor Julia Forward said. Sloka, 56, ran a neurology clinic at Grand River Hospital and had privileges at St. Mary’s General Hospital. Neurology focuses on disorders of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Jeffrey Sloka. In 2017, the College of Physicians and Surgeons ordered him to see patients only under supervision. In April 2019, the college revoked Sloka’s licence. Five months later, he was charged over incidents that began in 2010. His judge-alone trial began in September 2021 in a Kitchener court. It has now entered its fifth year after taking several long breaks with multiple delays. The trial heard testimony that Sloka made some patients disrobe, told others to leave gowns open at the front, made some bend over to examine their butt cheeks, cupped the breasts of others, and sometimes examined their vaginas. This “points to a sexual curiosity, not the broad medical interest that the defence would have you accept,” prosecutor Sidney McLean told the judge. Sloka testified that he conducted cardiac, skin, breast, pelvic and rectal examinations on some patients. He said he always got consent, by discussing each case with patients and sometimes by showing them pictures. Defence lawyer David Humphrey asked him at trial about allegations from each alleged victim. Sloka denied sexually assaulting them. Humphrey has asked the judge to discount the testimony of Dr. Vera Bril, a Toronto neurologist who told the trial that Sloka’s behaviour with patients was medically inappropriate. “She is not sufficiently independent, impartial, or unbiased” to be considered an expert medical witness, Humphrey said. Prosecutor McLean asked the judge to regard Bril’s testimony as “accurate and fair.” She noted that Bril sometimes declined to comment on areas outside of her scope when testifying. “Dr. Bril was very much alive to the limits of her own expertise,” McLean said. Five days have been set aside this week for closing arguments. Lawyers are revisiting testimony, arguing facts of law, and citing other judicial decisions they feel may be relevant. Parry previously said his “whole office is papered” with files connected to the case, including transcripts, exhibits and written submissions. “I’m very grateful for this week,” he told lawyers. “It has proven helpful to hear from both sides.” Error!

2 National Guard members shot near White House 'critically wounded',"Two National Guard members who were shot near the White House on Wednesday lost their lives, the governor of West Virginia said. Governor Patrick Morrisey confirmed their deaths in a social media post. ""We are in ongoing contact with federal officials as the investigation continues,"" he said. A suspect, now in custody, was also shot and has injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening, according to a law enforcement official not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. One National Guard member was shot in the head, according to a person familiar with the details of the incident who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. ""The president has been briefed,"" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said. Trump is at his resort in Palm Beach ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. U.S. Vice President JD Vance is in Kentucky. Trump said two National Guardsmen were ""critically wounded,"" and that the shooter was also severely injured. ""The animal that shot the two National Guardsmen, with both being critically wounded, and now in two separate hospitals, is also severely wounded, but regardless, will pay a very steep price,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. Stacey Walters, 43, was in an Uber near the White House around 2:15 p.m. ET (1915 GMT) when she heard two loud booms and saw young children and other pedestrians running from the scene. She said she heard someone yell ""Help! Help!"" and saw what appeared to be U.S. Secret Service agents running after someone in a hooded sweatshirt. The Secret Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The presence of the National Guard in the nation's capital has fueled a court fight and a broader public policy debate about the Trump administration's use of the military to combat what officials cast as an out-of-control crime problem. Trump issued an emergency order in August that federalized the local police force and sent in National Guard troops from eight states and the District of Columbia. The order expired a month later but the troops remained. The soldiers have patrolled neighborhoods, train stations and other locations, participated in highway checkpoints and also have also been assigned to trash pickup and to guard sports events. Last week, a federal judge ordered an end to the deployment but also put her order on hold for 21 days to allow the Trump administration time to either remove the troops or appeal the decision. Incoming flights to Reagan Washington National Airport were temporarily paused because of the locations of aircraft involved in responding to the shooting of two National Guardsmen, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Departing flights were not impacted and normal operations have now resumed. The airport is located just outside of the federal district and is connected to the same rail line as the train station near where the shooting took place. Other airports in the metropolitan area like Dulles International Airport and Baltimore-Washington International Airport were unaffected. California Gov. Gavin Newsom denounced the killings of two National Guardsmen in the nation's capital as ""horrific and unacceptable"" in a statement on social media. ""There must be zero tolerance for violence - of any kind - against the brave men and women in uniform who selflessly serve our communities and our country,"" Newsom said. ""Jen and I are praying for the service members, their families, and the entire National Guard community,"" the Democratic governor added. Social media video shared from the immediate aftermath of the shooting showed first responders attempting CPR on one of the national guardsmen and treating the other amid a glass-strewn sidewalk. Other officers could be seen steps away restraining an individual on the ground.",2025-11-26 20:08:00,Daily Sabah,negative,0.5338,23,Administration_To_Not," Two National Guard members who were shot near the White House are dead, West Virginia governor says .

Nigeria declares security emergency,"HARARE, November 26. /TASS/. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has announced a security emergency in the country and additional recruitment to the army and police, his special adviser on information and strategy Bayo Onanuga said on X. ""Today, taking into account the emerging security emergency, I have decided to declare a national security emergency and ordered additional recruitment to the Armed Forces. The police will recruit an additional 20,000 people, its number will reach 50,000. The police authorities are, by this statement, authorised to use various National Youth Service Corps camps as training depots. The officers being withdrawn from VIP guard duties should undergo crash training to debrief them and deliver more efficient police services when deployed to security-challenged areas of the country. The DSS also has my authority to immediately deploy all the forest guards already trained to flush out the terrorists and bandits lurking in our forests,"" the statement said. The president said that military personnel will regularly search churches and mosques, especially before prayers. State authorities have been asked to move schools to safer locations. Over the past couple of days, terrorists attacked several schools. On November 25, the government released 24 schoolgirls taken hostage on November 17. On the night of November 20-21, more than 300 students were abducted in the Niger state. On November 23, 50 of them returned home. Due to the increased attacks on schools, Tinubu canceled foreign trips. The governments of 10 out of the 36 states closed schools for security reasons.

Raiders must set future QB up for success,"The Las Vegas Raiders are sitting 2-8 when I write this and could either be 2-9 or 3-8 after their matchup vs the Cleveland Browns. Raiders QB Geno Smith has not been as expected throwing 13 interceptions to 12 touchdowns while also ranking bottom 8 in big time throw rate and and having the 3rd worst turnover worthy plate rate in the NFL this season. The Raiders can, and likely will, move on from him following this season though that decision is heavily dependent on if Pete Carroll remains the Raiders head coach in 2026. Las Vegas can take on an 18 million dead cap hit but will also free 8 million in cap space if they were to release Smith following this season, and from there the focus becomes drafting a rookie QB to potentially be your face of the franchise. As stated by Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell, “teams fail young quarterbacks before young quarterbacks fail the team” and that couldn’t be more accurate with recent history where the Vikings alone have helped revive the careers of Sam Darnold and Daniel Jones, who both have looked like potential future franchise quarterbacks going forward along with 49ers QB Mac Jones who has seen his career rebound this season. Geno Smith is not the Raiders answer at quarterback, the ideology of consistently going for veterans and journeyman quarterbacks is not a successful strategy, and in no way can it continue for Las Vegas. The worst case for the Raiders is they draft a young quarterback who doesn’t turn into the franchise option, and they end up having to take that shot again, you consistently draft a quarterback till you’re able to get it right. That said, the Raiders right now are not in a position to start a rookie quarterback and they will need to supplement around him before they can even consider throwing him into the fire. The Raiders offensive line is young and inexperience, but it’s also not good. Kolton Miller and Jackson Powers-Johnson anchor your offensive line with fellow 2024 3rd round T DJ Glaze having his ups and downs but looking to be a piece of the future at either tackle or guard going forward. Outside of those three, the Raiders have to look into adding a left guard, and then either a right guard or right tackle pending on Glaze. The team drafted Caleb Rogers and Charles Grant this season in the third round and while both have the future to play on the offensive line, neither have seen snaps this season (outside one snap from Grant on a kneeldown in the Raiders 33-0 blowout loss vs the Chiefs where he did what you should do on a kneel). Las Vegas needs to see what they have in Grant and Rogers going forward, and if neither are getting developed that’s a massive issue for the future. In addition to the offensive line, which will need to be addressed likely in a collection between free agency and the draft, Las Vegas has to address their wide receiver room as well. The Raiders drafted TCU standout Jack Bech in the 2nd round of the 2025 NFL Draft and Bech has seen limited snaps having his role taken over by veteran Tyler Lockett. Bech has looked good in his very very limited role, including multiple 20+ yard receptions and also averaging 1.71 yards of separation which would be third on the Raiders behind Tre Tucker and Brock Bowers while also ranking 22nd in the NFL if he was qualified. Speaking of Tre Tucker, the third year receiver from Cincinnati has come into a breakout role this season with 38 receptions, 502 yards, and 5 touchdowns with 1.98 yards of separation, a 2.1% drop rate, and a 67% contested catch rate which are all career highs. Tucker won’t be a standout top of the line wide receiver but he’s showing the ability to be a high end second receiver and the Raiders need to add a front of the rotation guy to supplement with him. Outside of Tucker and Bech 2025 4th rounder Dont’e Thornton has struggled to get open, win contested catches, and run good NFL caliber routes which will limit his time on the field. The Raiders must address their receiving room in addition to the offensive line this off-season to help set up a rookie quarterback with the necessary protection and weaponry to be successful. The Raiders are solidified at tight end with superstar Brock Bowers and quality depth with Michael Mayer. At runningback Ashton Jeanty has shown the ability to be a game breaking running back, though the Raiders offensive line has prevented the 2025 first rounder from being effective despite Jeanty ranking 7th in elusiveness, 12th in breakaway rate, and 4th in forced missed tackles. Jeanty will need a running mate this off-season but that’s down the line of needs. In addition to their offensive needs, the Raiders must address their defensive extensively adding to the pass rush, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties with good variety. The Raiders consistent reliance on “veteran rebuild” players has to stop the frequency (it’s fine in short bursts but solely relying on it will not win you games). As a result, the Raiders have lacked young talent on their defense for a while, and the first step there is to retain the young talent you do stumble across. Las Vegas has the money and draft capital to really turn things around in one year and become at minimum a competitive team that can win 7-9 games with the right coaching staff. Speaking of coaches, the Raiders focus going forward should not be on retread head coaches but young upcoming coordinators deserving their chance. Las Vegas has attempted the rehire with Jon Gruden, Josh McDaniels, and now Pete Carroll and they flat out haven’t been successful in doing so. Hiring a young innovative head coach on either side of the ball, ideally offensively, is the route that successful teams end up taking and one the Raiders should have followed a long time ago. The coaching world in the NFL is filled with young talent on both sides of the ball, and Las Vegas must try and attract one though the job likely won’t be the best given their lack of a franchise QB and unless they secure a top 3 selection that opportunity could be unlikely in year one. The Raiders aren’t going to turn things around in one year, but they have the ability to put the roster and the franchise on the right path this off-season, getting young at quarterback is the key but building around that quarterback for success will put them into competitive natures for longer than just one to two seasons.",2025-11-26 20:08:00,Yahoo! News,negative,0.6464,0,Loss_After_Career," The Las Vegas Raiders are sitting 2-8 when I write this and could either be 2-9 or 3-8 after their matchup vs the Cleveland Browns .

"LAGESC Dismantles Illegal Oil Bunkering Depot, Arrests 27 Suspects in Lekki","OLORUNDARE ENIMOLA The Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC), also known as KAI, has dismantled an illegal oil bunkering enclave and arrested 27 suspects found with fake naira notes during an enforcement operation at The Rock Drive in Lekki Phase 1. Corps Marshal Major Olaniyi Olatunbosun Cole (rtd) confirmed the development on Wednesday while briefing the media at the Agency’s headquarters in Bolade-Oshodi. He revealed that intelligence reports led operatives to the unlicensed depot where petroleum products were stored, adulterated, and distributed illegally. “We discovered how the activities of an unlicensed oil depot impacted the environment negatively, constituting threats to public health and safety. The location also provided cover for miscreants transacting with fake naira notes at night to unsuspecting vendors and residents,” Cole said. He disclosed that the special squad recovered makeshift storage facilities, drums, and jerry cans filled with adulterated diesel products, warning that the operation posed high risks of fire outbreaks, soil contamination, and hazards to nearby homes and businesses. The premises were secured while the supply connections were dismantled in line with environmental regulations. Twenty-seven suspects operating within the compound were arrested for illegal activities and possession of fake currency. Cole reiterated the commitment of the agency to sustaining enforcement actions and curbing environmental infractions statewide in line with the THEMES+ development agenda of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. He also appealed to residents to prioritise safety by making use of pedestrian bridges across the state to prevent avoidable road accidents.

2 National Guard members shot to death near White House,"Two National Guard members who were shot near the White House on Wednesday lost their lives, the governor of West Virginia said. Governor Patrick Morrisey confirmed their deaths in a social media post. ""We are in ongoing contact with federal officials as the investigation continues,"" he said. A suspect, now in custody, was also shot and has injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening, according to a law enforcement official not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. One National Guard member was shot in the head, according to a person familiar with the details of the incident who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. ""The president has been briefed,"" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said. Trump is at his resort in Palm Beach ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. U.S. Vice President JD Vance is in Kentucky. Trump said two National Guardsmen were ""critically wounded,"" and that the shooter was also severely injured. ""The animal that shot the two National Guardsmen, with both being critically wounded, and now in two separate hospitals, is also severely wounded, but regardless, will pay a very steep price,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. Stacey Walters, 43, was in an Uber near the White House around 2:15 p.m. ET (1915 GMT) when she heard two loud booms and saw young children and other pedestrians running from the scene. She said she heard someone yell ""Help! Help!"" and saw what appeared to be U.S. Secret Service agents running after someone in a hooded sweatshirt. The Secret Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The presence of the National Guard in the nation's capital has fueled a court fight and a broader public policy debate about the Trump administration's use of the military to combat what officials cast as an out-of-control crime problem. Trump issued an emergency order in August that federalized the local police force and sent in National Guard troops from eight states and the District of Columbia. The order expired a month later but the troops remained. The soldiers have patrolled neighborhoods, train stations and other locations, participated in highway checkpoints and also have also been assigned to trash pickup and to guard sports events. Last week, a federal judge ordered an end to the deployment but also put her order on hold for 21 days to allow the Trump administration time to either remove the troops or appeal the decision. Incoming flights to Reagan Washington National Airport were temporarily paused because of the locations of aircraft involved in responding to the shooting of two National Guardsmen, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Departing flights were not impacted and normal operations have now resumed. The airport is located just outside of the federal district and is connected to the same rail line as the train station near where the shooting took place. Other airports in the metropolitan area like Dulles International Airport and Baltimore-Washington International Airport were unaffected. California Gov.

""Jen and I are praying for the service members, their families, and the entire National Guard community,"" the Democratic governor added.

It's time to buy: 1 Australian stock that hasn't been this cheap in years,"Image source: Getty Images You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More If you're looking for a high-quality Australian tech stock trading well below what analysts believe it is worth, Xero Ltd (ASX: XRO) may be the opportunity hiding in plain sight. After a bruising year for ASX technology names and widespread concern about an AI-driven selloff, Xero's share price has cratered. This is a level that implies a dramatically weaker future than analysts actually expect. And according to a note out of Macquarie, the current price simply doesn't reflect Xero's long-term earnings power. In fact, the broker argues that the market is mispricing the company's US opportunity entirely. Macquarie currently has an outperform rating and a $230.30 price target on Xero. Based on its current share price, this implies potential upside of 92% for investors over the next 12 months. Macquarie's highlights that today's share price suggests that from FY 2028 Xero will miss the Rule of 40, which is a benchmark for high-performing software stocks, until FY 2033. That means the market is pricing in a dramatic slowdown in growth after FY 2-28, despite evidence to the contrary. The broker believes that its current valuation assumes Xero's core business slows to 12% annualised revenue growth beyond FY 2028 and never reaches the free-cash-flow margins achieved by its key competitor, Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU). Macquarie stresses that these assumptions are far too conservative. One of the most important points that Macquarie makes is that the US market is finally showing the same conditions that historically drove Xero's strongest growth in other regions. It notes that payment digitisation and cloud-accounting adoption are accelerating across the US, which has been a missing ingredient in past years. Xero's recent Melio acquisition gives the company a powerful distribution network and access to ~18 million small businesses via syndication partners. It said: Management are moving quickly, with deal close 2 months earlier than expected. This coincides with Trump's digitisation of payments gaining momentum. The IRS is phasing out paper refund checks from Sep 30 2025 and pushing customers to digital rails. Moreover, the GENIUS Act and the updating/adoption of FedNOW & FedRamp are pushing more customers to digital rails and digital tax. Historically, these are the two necessary preconditions for XRO to grow strongly in a market, and they are manifesting in the US now. Macquarie describes this as a ""perfect storm"" in Xero's favour and highlights that there is no clear number-two competitor in the US, and Intuit's growing focus on the mid-market leaves Xero's core small-business segment under-served. With the stock down sharply and Macquarie forecasting significant upside as its US strategy unfolds, Xero looks like one of the most attractive opportunities on the ASX right now. As a result, this is one Australian stock that I would happily buy more of at the current price.",2025-11-26 20:08:00,Fool Australia,neutral,0.6203,56,Business_Inflation_Investing," Xero Ltd (ASX: XRO) may be the opportunity hiding in plain sight .

Hornets face ‘new’ Mounties,"Bryant Coach Quad Sanders said he knows he isn't dealing with the same Rogers team of years past. The Mounties (10-1), ranked No. 4 overall, have already had a historic season. They've won 10 games for the first time since 2006, reached the semifinals for the first time since that same year and scored the most points in a single season (574) in school history. That's what the Hornets (11-1), ranked No. 1 overall, are up against Friday night in the Class 7A semifinals at Hornet Stadium. ""Those guys that we played (them) were sophomores. They're a whole lot better than they were when we played them a couple of years ago,"" Sanders said. ""We got to be prepared for a game. I mean, it's not the Rogers that everybody once knew. It's a new Rogers. It's a new day, and I think that's what they're out to prove."" Sanders is referring to their 2023 quarterfinal matchup, where Bryant defeated Rogers 56-32. Since then, Rogers has grown into one of the highest-scoring offenses in the state. Senior quarterback Jeff Regan has thrown for 1,722 yards, rushed for 1,269 yards and accounted for 45 touchdowns -- 23 rushing, 22 passing. His leading receiver is classmate Braxton Lindsey, who has committed to play linebacker at BYU next year. Lindsey has 44 catches for 759 yards and 11 touchdowns. ""(Regan is) extremely fast, and he's strong,"" Sanders said. ""It also helps to have a weapon to throw it to, like he has in Lindsey. You get a quarterback and a running back all in one, and then you get a receiver, running back and tight end all in the other. So you got about five players and two people. You just got to know where they are and be able to keep them in front of you. Because if not, one slip up goes to the house."" Bryant's offensive production wasn't too dissimilar from Rogers', but it's the way the Hornets get the production that is different. The Hornets are averaging 43.6 points per game. Their two quarterbacks, senior Jeremiah Motes and junior Kyler Shelby, have a combined 2,469 yards and 26 passing touchdowns. Senior running backs Kollin Robinson and Missouri commit T.J. Hodges have a combined for 1,622 rushing yards and 26 touchdowns. Motes has taken the majority of snaps recently for the Hornets, passing for a season-high 214 yards in their win over Fayetteville in the quarterfinals, but Sanders said he'll play both without hesitation. ""It's still the same,"" Sanders said. ""I think you just got to take it drive by drive and be able to coach them up, because they don't have the experience yet. Jeremiah is just a little bit older. He caught a groove on Friday, so you really don't want to pull that groove."" Sanders said there are pros and cons to having as much talent as Bryant does with multiple players per position believing they are capable of starting. but he added that overall it's a good problem to have. ""I think these guys are just having fun,"" he said. ""They're not selfish, and that's what makes a good team. Nobody's complaining, everybody's playing, doing what they're supposed to do. They all know, secretly, if I catch it, I better score, because I may not get it again."" BENTON Chasing history The road to the Class 6A state championship has, more often than not, ran through Greenwood since the Bulldogs joined the classification in 2012. During that span, they've won six state championships and been to 10 title games. Since Nov. 21, 2014, the Bulldogs have won 77 consecutive home games. Benton (9-2) will need to topple a dynasty when it travels to face Greenwood (11-0) in the Class 6A semifinals Friday night. ""I'm excited for the challenge,"" Benton quarterback Drew Davis said. ""Sophomore, junior year I never got to play them. I know they're good, and you want to play the good football teams to see how you stack up against them."" Greenwood is 7-2 all-time against Benton. Their last meeting also came in the 2022 semifinals, when the Bulldogs beat the Panthers 31-24. ""These kids were young,"" Benton Coach Brad Harris said. ""Some of these guys moved up and played as sophomores or freshmen against them, but they'll know how to handle that. This is not going to be a game that's going to be too big for them. They're going to be up for the challenge. ""We don't have anything to lose. Nobody's going to pick us to win. We don't care."" Benton has consistently been amongst the top teams in 6A over the past three seasons with this current senior class starting throughout. The one hurdle the Panthers haven't been able to get over with this group in the semifinals. Benton has lost in that round each of the past four seasons. ""We want to get to that next step,"" Harris said. ""These seniors have been to three semifinals, the first group that's done that. They're sitting at 29 wins as a team, and they got an opportunity to break that record. ""It's been since 2019 since we've been to the finals. I want them to be able to taste that. I've been there, but I want these guys to be able to taste a championship run, have an opportunity to win a title."" This matchup will also be a showcase of two of the state's top passing leaders, both of whom have thrown for more than 8,000 career yards. Davis has thrown for 3,119 yards, rushed for 501 yards and had a hand in a combined 54 touchdowns this season. He accounted for nine touchdowns in Benton's quarterfinal win over Mountain Home. Utah commit Kane Archer has thrown for 2,959 yards, rushed for 1,022 yards and accounted for 50 combined touchdowns. Davis said the pressure to be the senior class to get Benton back to the state championship game is there, but he's not letting that get in the way of his preparation. ""Being a senior, it hits more because it's your last season, and you want to be the class to be remembered,"" Davis said. ""I've been a part of some really good teams that made it to the semis, and we haven't been able to get over that hump. I'm just really excited for the opportunity to do it, because the talk about this year's team is we're not as good as the years past, and we're not good on defense, executing on offense. We just try to block out all the noise and focus on what we can control and what we can do."" HOT SPRINGS LAKESIDE Second chance There won't be many surprises when Hot Springs Lakeside faces Little Rock Parkview in the Class 5A semifinals at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock on Friday night. This will be the second time the 5A-South Conference foes have played this season and the fifth time in four seasons. ""It's kind of like when you play Lake Hamilton,"" Lakeside Coach Garren Rockwell said. ""They know what we're going to do, and we know what they're going to do. It ain't no schematic (change), too many adjustments. Let's get out here and play football. ""It's still this smash-mouth football. They want to run the ball, play-action pass off of it. We want to try to establish the run and get one-on-one matchups with our receivers on their DBs. And it's the same thing they want to do against us."" Lakeside (9-3) has never beaten Parkview (9-3), but its closest loss came on Oct. 31, when the three-time defending state champion Patriots won 24-22. Rockwell said he's hoping a second crack at them is what the Rams need to advance to the state championship game for the first time since 1975. ""It's big time for the familiarity of it,"" Rockwell said. ""These first two playoff games, we had never played Searcy before, ever, like in program history, and same thing with Greenbrier. And so you don't know what to expect, but we know what to expect at Parkview. It's going to be a good, physical game. Both sides got something to prove, and it should be a good contest."" Lakeside lost back-to-back games against Parkview and crosstown rival Hot Springs to end the regular season, dropping it to a No. 3 seed. After a convincing win over Searcy in the first round, Lakeside beat 5A-West champion Greenbrier, which was previously undefeated, 24-21 last week to advance to this game. The Patriots are looking for their fourth straight state title game despite finishing second in the conference for the first time since 2021. Parkview defeated Maumelle by three touchdowns in the first round before scoring a late touchdown in the quarterfinals to defeat Harrison 21-17.

Cops nab 16-year-old over assault of student at Sungai Petani school dormitory,"SUNGAI PETANI: A 16-year-old student has been remanded for three days to assist in the investigation of an assault case involving a Form Four student who was allegedly beaten unconscious at a school dormitory here early Monday (Nov 24) morning. The victim was found unconscious in a school toilet by his teacher before being sent to Sultan Abdul Halim Hospital for treatment. The boy’s mother was informed of the incident by the school at 9.05am, with bruising observed on her son’s body. It is learnt the victim was assaulted at around 12.10am, purportedly after allegedly badmouthing a friend of one of the suspects. Kuala Muda OCPD Asst Comm Hanyan Ramlan said preliminary investigations indicated that a student, angered by the victim’s alleged humiliation of his friend, invited three other students to confront the victim. Initially, four students aged between 16 and 17 were detained to assist in the investigation. However, only one, the Form Four student, was remanded for three days, while the other three were released by the Sungai Petani Court on Thursday (Nov 27). ACP Hanyan said this was the first such case at the dormitory, and there were no closed-circuit television (CCTV) recordings at the scene. The case is being investigated under Section 507 of the Penal Code.

Coleman ready to see what Warriors are made of,"It's still early in season, but Little Rock Hall boys basketball Coach Jon Coleman indicated that he's liked what he's seen out of his team. He may like them even more if the Warriors are able to bring home a title from one of the nation's more renown Thanksgiving tournaments. The 28th annual Rumble on the Ridge is set to begin Thursday at Dwight Lofton Mustang Arena in Forrest City with a four-game slate in a stacked boys division that'll feature six in-state teams. As has been the case since 2023, there will be a four-team girls division that will tip off Friday. The event is one of several taking place over the holiday weekend across the state. Others include the James Banks Classic in Marianna, the S.T.R.O.N.G. Showcase in Jacksonville and the Battle in the Rock at Little Rock Parkview to name a few. But Coleman has an affinity for the Rumble on the Ridge. His teams have played in the showcase seven other times, and he's always used it as a barometer to see where his Warriors stand. He's again expecting to get a gauge about his group's standing during this year's three-day event, starting with first-round foe Memphis Southwind. ""I'll say they're a familiar opponent,"" Coleman said. ""Over the years, we've hooked up with them in some very good games. I don't think we've played since 2017 or 2018, but it'll be a good opponent for us. ""I think they're ranked like fifth or sixth in Tennessee so anytime you can play a good basketball team early, it can't do anything but aid the growth of our team."" Progress is what Coleman said he has been searching for with his team. Hall (3-2), which is coming off a 60-31 victory over Little Rock Catholic on Tuesday, has a wealth of experience back from last year's team that finished 19-7. A pair of all-state seniors in University of Arkansas at Little Rock commit Micah Moore, a 5-10 guard, and Landen Hill, a 6-4 small forward, are back. The two combined for 31 points, with Moore tallying a game-high 20, in the Warriors' 29-point win over the Rockets. Coleman mentioned that Hill, who's essentially a four-year starter, and Moore, who suffered a hand injury last season before returning, have played well, along with senior Shaah Rahmaan, another veteran who's logged plenty of minutes as a starter . Hall also got a boost when Jace Sullivan, a 6-5 guard, transferred in from Conway during the offseason. However, one of the biggest pluses the Warriors have going for them is the return of Tristan Jahnke. The 6-9 forward tore an ACL early last season but is starting to ramp things up after getting cleared to play. ""He's healthy,"" Coleman said of his senior big man. ""He hadn't played in over a year and really just got released probably a couple of days before the season kicked off to basically start scrimmaging and having contact. So it's good to have him back in the mix. ""And I keep telling the guys, at this point last year we probably look exactly like we look now. Tristan and Micah both got hurt, but the guys really started playing together after that. When Micah came back, it was an even more cohesive group with him in there. So we're trying to get back to that point where we're playing for each other like we were then."" Coleman has tested his Warriors already this season. Hall has played last year's Class 5A state finalists, Maumelle and Benton, as well as Farmington, which reached the playoffs last season and is one of the favorites to make a deep postseason push next March. Hall went 1-2 in those games, but the defeats to reigning champion Benton (53-45) and Farmington (46-35) were competitive throughout. ""Not taking anything away from those teams because they're really good, but we had our chances,"" Coleman said. ""I think a more cohesive unit may have a made a big difference. I tell the guys, we've got to be able to do the small things if we're going to win those close games."" Those details are what Coleman said he is hoping the Warriors cling to at the Rumble on the Ridge. They're guaranteed to play three games, and each figures to test Hall in a multitude of ways. But that's just how its long-time coach likes it. ""We're going to Forrest City to look for some more chemistry to get better,"" Coleman said. ""The Rumble used to be known as one of the better Thanksgiving tournaments, and I think they're moving back in that direction. There's some really solid teams this year, including a really good North Little Rock group, Hot Springs and some others. ""So I like the feel of it, and I really like the way (organizers) run the tournament. That's why any time we get a chance to go, that's one of the places we head to.""

"Dear Abby: After 20 years of marriage couple finally plans a vacation alone, until husband totally messes it up","DEAR ABBY: My husband and I married 20 years ago. We have a blended family of eight kids, but it’s just us now. Our kids are scattered across the country. Over all these 20 years, we have never taken a vacation just for us. We have always visited family. Now, after scrimping, saving and planning, our dream trip is finally happening. We are visiting Disneyland! Problem is, our youngest just relocated to L.A. I bought tickets, scheduled tours and reserved meals for just the two of us. But my husband has included our son in everything now -- all park visits, dinners, etc. Don’t get me wrong -- I love my kids, but this was supposed to be “our” time. I agreed to one dinner with our son, but other than that, we are on our own. My husband wants to include him in everything because he lives close by. Now my husband says he doesn’t want to go at all. He insists that our son partake in everything we do, but I want this trip to be about us. We deserve this! How do I convince him that we need this trip? -- DISAPPOINTED IN OHIO DEAR DISAPPOINTED: You shouldn’t have to convince your husband to follow through on your dream vacation. He should have consulted you before inviting your son and telling him he will be included in everything. You wrote that you scrimped and saved for years to afford this vacation. How does he intend to pay for all those extra expenses for a third person? If your husband doesn’t want an experience “just for the two of you,” allow me to suggest it may be time to schedule something just for yourself. You have earned it. DEAR ABBY: I was engaged to my husband for three years before we got married. A little more than a year ago, he was told that he had two years to live. Six months later, we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary, and 10 days after that, he passed away. I have met a man who is two years younger than I am who makes me laugh again. I feel like a schoolgirl when I’m around him. He wants to be a roommate, live with me and sleep upstairs. I sleep downstairs, but I don’t know if I should let him or not. Advice? -- FEELING A BIT SCARED IN INDIANA DEAR FEELING: Would this man be paying you rent and buying food, or would you be picking up the tab? If all he wants is to be your platonic roommate, but you are physically attracted to him, I recommend against proceeding with the arrangement. You would find it increasingly painful and frustrating, and when you finally had had enough pain and frustration, you might have to hire an attorney to help you get him out. What seems attractive now could be a huge pain in the posterior, and I guarantee it wouldn’t leave you laughing. Keep things as they are until the relationship becomes more defined.

Residents mull new fire district in canyon,"LENORE — Volunteer firefighters are kicking around the idea of starting a new rural fire district to cover an area north of the Clearwater River from east of Arrow Junction to just west of Lenore. The notion was inspiration born of a touch of desperation. This winter, from Dec. 1 to March 1, fire coverage will diminish as two of three fire engines have to be moved out of a county-owned, insulated pole-building that the Big Canyon Fire District (BCFD) leases and shares with Nez Perce County Road and Bridge Department in Lenore. After a September meeting between three Nez Perce County commissioners and BCFD leaders, the county followed up with an Oct. 16 email telling BCFD to vacate half of the structure. The road department said it needs the space to store a de-icer truck and de-icing chemicals. “That’s our only option for a shop because of the restrictions on Lenore Bridge,” said NPC Road Director Roy Hill. Until now, the fire district used the whole building despite an agreement with the county that entitled them to half, Hill said. But in 2023, the Idaho Transportation Department reduced the truck weights allowed on the steel, wood and concrete Lenore Bridge, which was built in 1935. Now that the Sunnyside Bench Road is paved from Orofino to Lenore, the county needs the too-heavy deicer truck parked on the north side of the river. Hill said bags of deicer need to be stored inside or they absorb moisture and become unusable bricks. BCFD fire leaders have a similar problem: fire engines need to be parked inside. Unfortunately, the volunteers were unable to find alternative space, said BCFD Fire Chief Randy Maas. So, BCFD is moving two fire trucks out and leaving only one. The Sunnyside Volunteer Fire District will help pick up the slack in coverage over the winter. In the meantime, Craig Selby, a BCFD volunteer firefighter since 2023, decided it may be time to look into starting a new fire district. Some people may not be able to get insurance without a fire district, he said. And, a homeowner who helps pay for a fire district may see significant savings with reduced home insurance costs. Selby, Maas, and BCFD Commissioner Bruce Lang were all at an informational meeting held Nov. 11 at the Lenore Community Center where they discussed the new fire district idea. Early discussions with community members have been met with general support and resulted in two offers of donated land to build a new shop. By way of comparison, the BCFD runs on a $30,000 annual budget, Lang said. He also noted that the new district would have no paid positions, despite rumors to the contrary. While locals mull over the new fire district, the county road department will return the space to the BCFD in Lenore next spring. The county has pledged to build another shed for its equipment in the summer. In an email to the Lewiston Tribune, NPC Commissioner Joe Gish wrote: “NPC also agreed to build a new heated shop on the Lenore lot’s lower flat next summer for storing NPC Road Department equipment and give BCFD a long term lease of the existing Lenore Shop for its sole use. This solution will eliminate any future conflicts. NPC has begun the planning for the new shop and also believes we have identified a funding source.” As for increased local needs and the competition for space, mostly it’s connected to the influx of people building homes in the fire-prone landscape along the Clearwater River. Roy Hill estimates that the population along the Clearwater has at least quadrupled in the past decade. Lang says some folks have moved in from out of state with little practical knowledge of the area’s fire risk. “A lot of people have moved here and don’t really know what they’re in for,” Lang said. If the past several years are any indicator, the whole community is in for hot, dry summers that make homeowners appreciate volunteer fire departments. The Clearwater Canyon corridor has seen devastating fires in recent years. The Gwen Fire in 2024 burned more than 118 structures — which included 25 homes — and more than 28,800 acres. In 2021, the Bedrock Fire near Lenore burned 11,000 acres, taking with it three homes and a dozen other structures.

They remain silent on feminicide,"İlayda KayaThe decision to impose life imprisonment for the crime of femicide (the gender-based killing of women) in Italy was one of the biggest steps taken globally in the fight against violence against women. While countries such as Argentina, Peru and Malta have for years defined female murders as a separate crime and imposed severe penalties, in Turkey ‘killing because she is a woman’ is still not recognised as a specific category of crime. In female murder cases, the judicial process is conducted without regard to gender, obscuring the gender dimension. With this judicial process, perpetrators receive low sentences due to provocation and good behaviour reductions. Women are reacting to Turkey's failure to recognise “femicide” as a specific crime and to take comprehensive steps to strengthen deterrence against the daily increase in femicides.DETERRENT PUNISHMENT IS ESSENTIALCanan Güllü, President of the Federation of Women's Associations of Turkey, said the following about the decision: ""There is still no such definition in Turkey regarding the murder of women. Murders are removed from the gender-based category and classified as “intentional killing”.Following the murders of women in Italy, they recognised the danger and took a decision to prevent it by classifying it as gender-based murder through femicide. The situation in Turkey is worse; murders of women are increasing exponentially, especially after the Istanbul Convention was repealed. Furthermore, the perception of impunity is very widespread in the judicial processes in Turkey. We also see judges saying, “I take a human-centred approach”. In Italy, these important steps and the parliamentary decisions taken are undermining the perpetrators. The impunity in our country, however, encourages the perpetrators. We must follow this path too. When a woman is murdered, the perpetrator should be given a life sentence.""HEAVY PENALTIES ARE IMPOSEDIn recent years various countries have introduced legal measures to combat femicides. They have defined femicide as a separate offence and aimed to prevent reduced sentences for women’s murders. Some recent examples are:• ARGENTINA: In 2012 femicide was defined as “aggravated murder” and punishable by life imprisonment. In 2024 the country recorded 295 femicide cases which meant a woman was killed every 30 hours. The situation worsened in 2025. In the first four months 96 women’s murders were reported with the highest numbers in Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Córdoba.• PERU: The National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI) reported 146 femicide cases in 2023. Between 2015 and 2023 a total of 1,191 cases were recorded with the highest annual number in 2018 at 150. Femicide is recognised as an independent offence and carries a minimum sentence of 20 years. In severe cases the sentence is aggravated life imprisonment.• MALTA: Femicide was added as a separate aggravating factor in the criminal code in June 2022. Courts are expected to impose the heaviest penalty in gender-based killings of women and life imprisonment became the standard sanction. The aim is to prevent sentence reductions for these crimes.• NORTH MACEDONIA: Amendments to the criminal code in February 2023 added a new paragraph defining the killing of a woman as an act of gender-based violence. It states “Another offence of ending the life of a woman or girl under 18 while committing gender-based violence”.• CROATIA: In 2023 femicide began to be defined as a specific offence. Penalties are harsher especially when the perpetrator is a partner or former partner.• BOLIVIA: Under a law adopted in 2013 femicide is categorised as a specific offence. The maximum penalty is up to 30 years in prison with no reductions applied.UNJUST PROVOCATION REDUCTIONS ARE UNACCEPTABLEIn Italy the right-wing coalition government’s bill imposing heavy penalties such as life imprisonment for women’s murders was unanimously approved in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, and became law. Reports stated that between 1 January and 20 October 2025, 85 women were killed in the country. In Turkey 317 women were killed in the first ten months of 2025. Sentence reductions were applied to men who murdered women. Some examples are:• 13.08.25 – In İzmir Serkan Dindar appeared before the court for killing Ceyda Yüksel after she rejected his sexual advance. He was tried on the charge of “premeditated murder” with a request for 24 years in prison. An “unjust provocation reduction” was applied and the sentence was lowered to 18 years.• 18.02.25 – In Diyarbakır Özcan Yıldız, who murdered Rozerin Yıldız while they were in the process of divorcing, received an “unjust provocation” reduction. The court sentenced him to 19 years 2 months.POLICE OFFICER KILLED THE WOMANIn Kayseri police officer S.U. killed his mother-in-law M.M. The incident happened around 13.00 yesterday in the Melikgazi district. At a vineyard house an argument broke out between 35-year-old S.U. and his 60-year-old mother-in-law M.M. over inheritance. S.U. shot M.M. with a pistol then shot himself with the same weapon. Police and medical teams were sent to the scene upon a report.

In recent years various countries have introduced legal measures to combat femicides. They have defined femicide as a separate offence and aimed to prevent reduced sentences for women’s murders. Some recent examples are:• ARGENTINA: In 2012 femicide was defined as “aggravated murder” and punishable by life imprisonment. In 2024 the country recorded 295 femicide cases which meant a woman was killed every 30 hours. The situation worsened in 2025. In the first four months 96 women’s murders were reported with the highest numbers in Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Córdoba.• PERU: The National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI) reported 146 femicide cases in 2023. Between 2015 and 2023 a total of 1,191 cases were recorded with the highest annual number in 2018 at 150. Femicide is recognised as an independent offence and carries a minimum sentence of 20 years. In severe cases the sentence is aggravated life imprisonment.• MALTA: Femicide was added as a separate aggravating factor in the criminal code in June 2022. Courts are expected to impose the heaviest penalty in gender-based killings of women and life imprisonment became the standard sanction. The aim is to prevent sentence reductions for these crimes.• NORTH MACEDONIA: Amendments to the criminal code in February 2023 added a new paragraph defining the killing of a woman as an act of gender-based violence. It states “Another offence of ending the life of a woman or girl under 18 while committing gender-based violence”.• CROATIA: In 2023 femicide began to be defined as a specific offence. Penalties are harsher especially when the perpetrator is a partner or former partner.• BOLIVIA: Under a law adopted in 2013 femicide is categorised as a specific offence. The maximum penalty is up to 30 years in prison with no reductions applied.UNJUST PROVOCATION REDUCTIONS ARE UNACCEPTABLEIn Italy the right-wing coalition government’s bill imposing heavy penalties such as life imprisonment for women’s murders was unanimously approved in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, and became law. Reports stated that between 1 January and 20 October 2025, 85 women were killed in the country. In Turkey 317 women were killed in the first ten months of 2025. Sentence reductions were applied to men who murdered women. Some examples are:• 13.08.25 – In İzmir Serkan Dindar appeared before the court for killing Ceyda Yüksel after she rejected his sexual advance. He was tried on the charge of “premeditated murder” with a request for 24 years in prison. An “unjust provocation reduction” was applied and the sentence was lowered to 18 years.• 18.02.25 – In Diyarbakır Özcan Yıldız, who murdered Rozerin Yıldız while they were in the process of divorcing, received an “unjust provocation” reduction. The court sentenced him to 19 years 2 months.POLICE OFFICER KILLED THE WOMANIn Kayseri police officer S.U. killed his mother-in-law M.M. The incident happened around 13.00 yesterday in the Melikgazi district. At a vineyard house an argument broke out between 35-year-old S.U. and his 60-year-old mother-in-law M.M. over inheritance. S.U. shot M.M. with a pistol then shot himself with the same weapon. Police and medical teams were sent to the scene upon a report.

Asking Eric: Surly college student may get the boot from cousin’s house if she doesn’t show more respect,"Dear Eric: I allowed the daughter of a cousin, with whom I am not close, to move in with me while she finishes college. When she moved in last January it was supposed to be for a semester, but this is the longest semester I have ever seen. We had an incident where she left gobs of hair all over my bathroom, which I had to clean up. I told her via text I didn’t like it. She walked around my house for weeks so angry with me, and when I said something to her as she was leaving the house, she slammed the door in my face. There were other incidents. When she moved in, she had at least nine big boxes in my living room. I have been asking for around seven months for her to move them, and she won’t. So, we had a big blow-up because of that and now she is walking around sullen. She said she has to keep her peace; she won’t speak. She won’t do her chores anymore, either. I want her to leave. She’s just plain rude. Am I wrong? – Bad Housemate Dear Housemate: It seems like she’s fallen into the pattern of being the sullen teenager, making you the nagging parent. But you’re not her parent and, if she’s finishing college, she’s probably not a teenager either. She’s a guest in your home and she needs to treat the home and you with respect. If she won’t contribute to the order of the home and won’t communicate with you, then it’s not working, and you should tell her that. She doesn’t get a free pass. If you want to give her another chance before asking her to leave, then it’s time to have a “state of the arrangement” conversation where you lay out what your expectations are and ask her if she can accept those. Also state that there are consequences to the agreement not being honored, namely that this wouldn’t be a place where she was able to stay any longer. Lastly, get a timeline. How long is this degree going to take? How many credits does she have left? From your letter, however, it sounds like you’re fed up and that’s fine. We’re coming up on the end of another semester. This may be the right time for her to find another option. Because your cousin made the arrangement, you might also loop her in so she’s not blindsided and so she can help her daughter to take responsibility. Send questions to R.

‘Frustrating’: Veterinarians urge regulatory changes as medicine shortages mount,"REGINA — Canadian veterinarians no longer have to access to 40 per cent of medications they once were able to use, a figure the head of the national association says is worrying. Tracy Fisher, president of the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association, says drugs for animals — from cats and dogs to sheep and cattle — are becoming increasingly unavailable. She says Canadian regulations discourage drug manufacturers from going through the process to get their medications approved for distribution, even though the medicines are available in other countries. Animal welfare issues arise when veterinarians have fewer drugs at their disposal, she adds. “If you have an animal suffering from a disease and you can’t treat it, but your colleagues across the border or everywhere else can, that’s incredibly frustrating,” Fisher said in a recent interview. A lack of medications can also affect the food system, she said. For example, a new drug to treat dairy cows may not be available in Canada, resulting in veterinarians using an older, less effective medication. “(The cow) may not be able to be part of the milk supply system during that time,” Fisher said. “Worst-case scenario, the farmer loses that cow. That impacts his bottom line. And every time that happens, things become more expensive for producers ... that has to be passed to us.” Registered veterinary technician Sawyer Daley said a key medicine to deal with lice in cattle is no longer available. Daley, who works in southern Alberta, said she’s not sure why she can’t get the product, as it remains available in the United States. “We’re losing access to products that are perfectly safe and ethical to use on animals,” she said this week in Regina at Canadian Western Agribition, Canada’s largest livestock show. “It was a really great product, but because the regulations are different between the U.S. and Canada, it got stopped.” Fisher said another medication to control urinary issues in dogs is also set to become unavailable. “If that goes off the market, there are going to be a number of animals that it’ll be difficult to control that problem,” she said. “If you’re an owner of a fairly large dog that is leaking urine all over the house, that’s going to be a very serious problem for you.” Fisher said the issue lies with regulatory changes Health Canada made in 2017. She said the agency imposed new inspection standards that year, requiring manufacturing facilities in other countries to be inspected by Canadian officials. Manufacturers don’t want to pay to have those inspections, she said, because Canada is a small market and they’ve already received approvals in other countries. Since then, more drugs have become unavailable in Canada. “We’ve lost 40 per cent of the medications that we used to have in the 1980s,” Fisher said. Health Canada said in a statement that changes were made to increase oversight of animal health products. Canada’s small share of the global market can result in delays to access, it added. “Health Canada continues to consult with industry stakeholders, veterinary professionals, and provincial (and) territorial partners to identify barriers and develop solutions,” it said. The agency said it has also introduced new measures to bring products to market, including prioritizing reviews, allowing conditional approval and promoting talks between the drug industry, veterinarians and farmers. “Health Canada will continue to build on this progress,” it said. The veterinarian association is pressing Ottawa to collaborate with international regulators, including those in the United States and Europe, to streamline drug approvals. Fisher said Canada should license products if they have been approved in two other reliable countries with strong safety regulations. “(The drugs) already have the standards met in Europe, Great Britain and the U.S.” Fisher said. “Eliminate some of the red tape and bureaucratic processes that are holding up some of these things.” Federal Agriculture Minister Heath MacDonald told reporters this week that he has met with veterinarians on the issue. “We’re going to work hand in hand to see what we have to do,” he said in Regina. Daley said more research employees with a veterinary background, including those with experience in livestock, are needed. “I would like to see less bias in the policy and decision-making by better representation from (those) with large animal medicine,” she said.

"Everything P Diddy, Luigi Mangione and Ghislaine Maxwell are eating this Thanksgiving","It sounds like the dinner party from hell but the details of Thanksgiving meals for a trio of notorious prisoners have been published today. Among those tucking into a festive American feast on Thursday are accused UnitedHealthcare CEO slayer Luigi Mangione, disgraced music mogul and convicted sex pest P Diddy and sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. The Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Mangione currently resides, confirmed that it will be dishing out roast turkey, mashed potatoes and brown gravy for the big day. While over in New Jersey, where Diddy is being housed in Fort Dix, the facility said that a full feast of roast turkey, cornbread dressing, baked sweet potato, mashed potatoes, chicken gravy, whole wheat bread and fruit or holiday dessert is on the menu. But it’s Texas’ minimum-security Federal Prison Camp Bryan that appears to be going all-out. The prison, home to Maxwell, confirmed it will offer the largest spread, with cornbread dressing, turkey, ham, mashed potatoes, green beans, dinner rolls, cranberry sauce, gravy and an assortment of pies, reports the New York Post. And for the inmates who prefer to skip the meat, all three facilities say they’ll also be offering alternatives such as veggie stir fry, tofu and soy chicken and veggies. In July, Diddy - whose real name Sean Combs - was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution following an eight-week trial. However, he was cleared of the most serious charges he faced. The Manhattan jury considered charges that Diddy, 56, had trafficked his victims for sex, ran a racketeering conspiracy and transported victims across state lines to engage in prostitution. Diddy's trial lasted a gruelling eight weeks with a number of witnesses called to present accounts of how he allegedly used violence, fear and drugs against women. He was cleared of two counts of sex trafficking and one count racketeering conspiracy in a mixed verdict. In December 2021, Maxwell was convicted of luring young girls to massage rooms for disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein to molest. Maxwell, 63, daughter of media mogul Robert, was accused of procuring young girls for Epstein and even colluding in the abuse he carried out. Her full indictment listed the charges as: conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, and conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. Mangione, 27, is currently in prison waiting to go on trial for murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York in December 2024. He remains charged for federal crimes, although claims of terrorism have since been dropped following court hearings, and he could potentially face the death penalty if found guilty of the murder.

Packers’ controversial touchdown leaves Tom Brady and Kevin Burkhardt stunned,"What’s a Thanksgiving clash without a side of controversy? Looking to extend a 3-0 lead over Detroit early in the second quarter Thursday, Packers quarterback Jordan Love tossed a 22-yard touchdown pass on a fourth-and-2 to wideout Dontayvion Wicks, who narrowly tapped it into the end zone — a play that stunned commentators Tom Brady and Kevin Burkhardt. “Oh, he is not going to be in, I don’t think,” Burkhardt said before the Packers officially went up 10-0. On 4th down, Dontayvion Wicks makes an incredible catch for the touchdown @packers up 10-0GBvsDET on FOX/FOX One/TubiAlso streaming on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/56vQWJ7RxQ The drama at the center of the catch stemmed from whether or not Wicks’ second foot was in with control of the ball. After the score, Fox Sports rules analyst Dean Blandino elaborated on the call. “The key is when does Wicks get control of the ball? And to me, if he has control, that first foot is the right foot, then the left foot is the second foot, so that’s what they’re ruling there for a touchdown,” Blandino said. When Brady asked, “Even if the ball switches hands,” Blandino replied, “Is he switching it within his control or does it physically come loose? It can move, but he had control.” The Packers got a second break from the refs in the second quarter when they granted head coach Mike LaFleur a timeout before an offensive lineman committed a false start on a fourth-and-1 play from the Lions’ 2-yard line. Replays showed that LaFleur had not signaled for the timeout until after the flag was thrown, though Fox’s Tom Rinaldi reported that LaFleur had been yelling for one as well. The decision allowed the Packers to go for it — instead of kicking a field goal — and Love hit Romeo Doubs for a touchdown to give the Packers a 17-7 lead.

Russian spacecraft with US-Russian crew docks at International Space Station,"MOSCOW — A U.S.-Russian crew of three began a mission to the International Space Station aboard a Russian spacecraft following a successful launch Thursday. A Soyuz booster rocket lifted off at 2:27 p.m. (9:27 a.m. GMT) from the Russia-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan to put the Soyuz MS-28 into orbit. The spacecraft carried NASA astronaut Chris Williams and two Russian crewmates, Sergei Mikaev and Sergei Kud-Sverchkov. The craft docked at the International Space Station approximately three hours after liftoff at 5:34 p.m All three are expected to spend about eight months at the orbiting outpost. NASA said this is the first spaceflight for Williams, a physicist, and Mikaev, a military pilot. This is the second flight for Kud-Sverchkov. At the International Space Station, the trio will join NASA astronauts Mike Fincke, Zena Cardman and Jonny Kim, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonauts Sergei Ryzhikov, Alexei Zubritsky and Oleg Platonov.

Catching up with coach Robb Akey ahead of his return to the Palouse,"The choice was simple for Robb Akey. Step into a tough situation and make it as good as it could be for the over 100 young men in the Oregon State football program. When the Beavers fired their coach, Pullman native Trent Bray, after a 0-7 start to the season, OSU made Akey its interim head coach. The move marked the first time in 13 years — since he himself was fired midseason by the University of Idaho — that Akey would lead a college football team. Prior to his Idaho tenure from 2007-12, Akey was an assistant at Washington State from 1999-2006. “When I got asked to do this. It was a matter of being able to help these guys get through an adverse situation and help them pick themselves up,” Akey said. “They had a great relationship with coach Bray. We all did and that wasn’t an easy thing to do. And so as coaches, we’ve had to do a great job of helping them see what they’re capable of doing.” The Beavers won Akey’s OSU interim coach debut 45-13 over Football Championship Subdivision foe Lafayette. “They were able to smile for the first time all season after coming off of a field,” Akey said. “And that was a big win. That was a big deal.” The Beavers kept the smiles on their faces two weeks later when they edged Washington State 10-7. Almost a month later, the two schools meet again in what is all but officially Akey’s final game at the helm for the Beavers. WSU hosts OSU at 3:30 p.m. Saturday at Gesa Field in Pullman. The Pac-2 Championship The rematch will cap a unique pair of seasons in which WSU and OSU survived together following the mass departure of 10 former Pac-12 schools. The conference rebuilt itself and, in July, will welcome six new football-sponsoring members. It has been a year of transition for both programs, with a majority nonconference schedules and two matchups against each other. OSU fans rushed the field in Corvallis after the Akey-led Beavers beat the Cougars on Nov. 1. While OSU narrows its search for a new head coach, with several high-profile candidates reportedly interviewing this week, Akey remains focused on the 60 minutes of football left in the season. “We’re getting to play a rival game again, and we beat them the last time,” Akey said in his Monday media availability. “So you want like the dickens to be able to do that twice. And that means you get the opportunity to own it. And it also gives us the opportunity to be the Pac champions. And that means a hell of a lot, in my opinion. And that’s how our guys are going to go about it.” Saturday will be Akey’s first time coaching in Pullman’s Martin Stadium since his Vandals lost 45-28 to his mentor Bill Doba’s WSU Cougars on Sept. 15, 2007. Lessons learned from Price and Doba Akey worked for coach Mike Price, who coached him when he was a defensive lineman at Weber State in the 1980s. In 1999, Price brought Akey to Pullman to serve as his defensive line coach. When WSU defensive coordinator Doba became the Cougars’ head coach, he chose Akey as his DC. Akey said he owes a lot to Price and Doba. Akey aided the Cougars’ 2002 Rose Bowl berth and three top-ten finishes in the postseason AP media poll. “He’s a brother to me, a best friend,” Akey said of Doba. “He’s a great person and the way he has done things, and things I’ve learned from him have had a lot to do with why I coach the way I do and do the things that I do.” Akey’s biggest takeaway from his Wazzu mentors? “The way that you treat people is what matters,” Akey said. “God forbid, a bad situation happens, if the last word that my players heard from me was ‘I love you,’ then that’s a pretty good thing.” Runs in the family The last time that Akey visited Pullman was when his son, Daniel Akey, worked for the late Mike Leach from 2017-19 and then the next year for coach Nick Rolovich at WSU. Daniel Akey worked in an equipment support role when his father worked for the Washington Redskins in 2016. They got to work together again at Central Michigan. In 2025, he joined the Oregon State staff with his father as a special teams quality control analyst. Daniel’s interest in coaching runs several generations deep. Richard Hannan, Daniel Akey’s grandfather and Robb Akey’s father-in-law, is a part of the Lewis-Clark State College Hall of Fame in Lewiston after coaching the Warriors’ men’s basketball team and serving as the LCSC athletic director from 1974-91. Hannon played a pivotal role in helping get the NAIA baseball World Series to Lewiston. Game-time temperatures are expected to be under 40 degrees Fahrenheit this weekend in Pullman, so Akey said he does not mind if his in-laws, who still live in the area, don’t make it to the game. “They may say, ‘Hey, we’re going to watch on the big screen and the warmth of the house, and I would understand that too,” Akey said. “I got brother-in-laws in the area, so we’ll probably have quite a few, and there’ll be a lot of people, obviously, that we know that’ll be there. So it’ll be pretty cool.” The chance to coach again For a time, Akey’s plan in Moscow was working. The Vandals won the 2009 Humanitarian Bowl in Boise in a dramatic 43-42 shootout against Bowling Green. Then, they came one snap away in 2010 — on two different occasions — from qualifying for two consecutive bowl games for what would have been the first time in Idaho history. The Vandals were 20-50 through six seasons during Akey’s tenure. Akey said he absolutely would like to be a college football head coach again or, at the very least, continue to coach. “I just know this is my way of life and this is what I am meant to do,” Akey said. “We’re going to be doing this for a lot of years to come. Unfortunately, we’re in a situation (where) we’re going to have to find out where the next stop’s going to be and we’ll see what the future holds.” Taylor can be reached at 208-848-2268, staylor@lmtribune.com, or on X or Instagram @Sam_C_Taylor.",2025-11-28 08:04:00,Dnews,neutral,0.5171,-1,Outlier," Robb Akey has been in charge of the Oregon State football program for 13 years .

How much will DWP benefits and pensions rise following the budget?,"Benefits Budget 2025 Child Benefit Department for Work and Pensions DWP Pensions PIP Rachel Reeves Universal Credit National government Personal Finance DWP benefits including Universal Credit, Child Benefit, PIP, Carer's Allowance, and the State Pension are to increase in April 2026 after Rachel Reeves announced higher payments in her budget speech today. Anyone who claims DWP benefits should be in line for an increase in the next financial year, as the chancellor laid out plans to help pensioners, disabled people, parents, low earners, carers and unemployed people keep up with rising costs. Addressing MPs, Ms Reeves said: ""The broken welfare system that we inherited wrote off millions of people as too sick to work and we will reform that system so that it is a system that does not count the cost of failure, but one that protects people who cannot work and empowers those who can. ""We have brought back face-to-face assessments for disability benefits. Those are the face-to-face assessments that the shadow chancellor (Sir Mel Stride) got rid of when he was work and pensions secretary and our changes we have made to Universal Credit will get 15,000 people back into work, a figure confirmed today."" This year the standard rises, but some - notably those paid to people over state pension age and Universal Credit - should increase more. Earlier this year, the government announced new proposals – which became law earlier this month under the Universal Credit Act – that it was changing how it would decide any increase in the universal credit standard allowance. The new rules mean that - for the next four years at least - universal credit payments should increase by the rate of inflation as before, but with an additional top-up cash payment. In April 2026, Universal Credit Claimants should see their payments rise by a combined total of more than 6%, reflecting September's 3.8% inflation rate, plus the standard allowance increase of 2.3%. It's worth noting that that this increase is only for the standard allowance — the basic universal credit payment rate — and the health element of the payment affected by cuts. As of next April, any claimants of the health element from this date will have that rate frozen and halved until 2029-30. With the 3.8% uplift, families with one child should receive receive the new amount of around £27.04, up 99p from £26.05 per week each week from April 2026. Families should also receive £17.90 per week (up from £17.25) for each additional child they have after that. It's estimated that around 7 million families claim Child Benefit in the UK, for around 13 million children, although figures change slightly each year. Recommended reading: Unlike Universal Credit, those in England and Wales who receive PIP will see their payments increased solely in line with inflation. Both the daily living and mobility standard and enhanced rates should rise by 3.8% in line with inflation as of April. Carer’s allowance — paid to individuals caring for someone at least 35 hours per week who receives certain disability-related benefits — will also increase in line with inflation. The rate should increase from £81.90 to £83.30. Unlike any other benefit, the state pension is guaranteed by the triple lock — which rises in line with whatever is the highest figure out of inflation, the previous summer's average earnings growth, or a baseline figure of 2.5%. Next year, the state pension should rise by 4.8% in line with the average earnings growth, boosting payments by around £500 a year.",2025-11-28 08:04:00,Borehamwood Times,positive,0.8603,6,Executive_Government_Plans," DWP benefits including Universal Credit, Child Benefit, PIP, Carer's Allowance, and the State Pension are to increase in April 2026 .

The Latest: Trump wants to ‘permanently pause’ migration to the US from poorer countries,"President Donald Trump says he wants to “permanently pause migration” from poorer nations and is promising to seek to expel millions of immigrants from the United States by revoking their legal status. He is blaming immigrants for problems from crime to housing shortages as part of “social dysfunction” in America and demanding “REVERSE MIGRATION.” His most severe social media post against immigration since returning to the Oval Office in January came after two National Guard members were shot while patrolling the streets of the nation’s capital under his orders. One died, and the other is in critical condition. Since the shooting not far from the White House, administration officials have pledged to reexamine millions of legal immigrants, building on a 10-month campaign to reduce the immigrant population. In a lengthy social media post late Thursday, the Republican president asserted that millions of people born outside the U.S. and now living in the country bore a large share of the blame for America’s societal ills. Here's the latest: Shooting suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal was living with his family in Bellingham, authorities said. The actions “don’t represent Bellingham’s values. They don’t reflect the values of either Washington,” Mayor Kim Lund said in a written statement. “They don’t represent what makes our communities great.” In an email to The Associated Press, Bellingham police Lt. Claudia Murphy did not address whether the department had any past encounters with Lakanwal. The chief said the department would assist the FBI if help is needed. Amazon Flex allows people to use their own cars to deliver packages to customers. Rahmanullah Lakanwal worked as an independent contractor for the company from the end of July to the end of August and hadn’t been active since, a company spokesperson told The Associated Press. Charges against Lakanwal were upgraded to first-degree murder after one of the soldiers died, federal authorities said Friday. Lakanwal served in a CIA-backed Afghan army unit before immigrating to the U.S. in 2021. He lived in Bellingham, Washington, and drove across the country before Wednesday’s shooting, authorities said. Mohammad Sherzad, a neighbor of Lakanwal’s in Bellingham, Washington, told The Associated Press in a phone interview Friday that Lakanwal was polite, quiet and spoke very little English. Sherzad said he attended the same mosque as Lakanwal and had heard from other members that Lakanwal was struggling to find work. Some of his children attended the same school as Lakanwal’s children, Sherzad said. “He was so quiet and the kids were so polite, they were so playful. But we didn’t see anything bad about him. He was looking OK,” Sherzad said. Sherzad said Lakanwal “disappeared” about two weeks ago. Beckstrom enlisted in 2023, the same year she graduated high school, and served with distinction as a military police officer with the 863rd Military Police Company, the West Virginia National Guard said in a statement. “She exemplified leadership, dedication, and professionalism,” the statement said, adding that Beckstrom “volunteered to serve as part of Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful, helping to ensure the safety and security of our nation’s capital.” Trump called Beckstrom an “incredible person, outstanding in every single way.” Soon after Wednesday’s shooting, Trump said he would send 500 more National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. It’s not clear where the additional troops would come from. As of early November, the D.C. National Guard had the largest number on the ground, with 949 members. In addition to West Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama also had forces in the capital early this month. A federal judge last week ordered an end to the Guard deployment but also put her order on hold for 21 days to allow the Trump administration time to either remove the troops or appeal. Video reviewed by investigators showed Lakanwal “came around the corner” on Wednesday afternoon and immediately started firing at the troops, according to Jeffery Carroll, an executive assistant D.C. police chief. Troops ran over and held down the shooter, Carroll said, and he was taken into custody. Authorities believe he was the only gunman. Carroll said that it was not clear whether one of the Guard members or a law enforcement officer shot Lakanwal. The suspect’s wounds were not believed to be life-threatening, one of the officials said. Beckstrom, 20, and Wolfe, 24, were deployed with the West Virginia National Guard to the nation’s capital as part of Trump’s crime-fighting mission that involved taking over the local police department. There were nearly 2,200 Guard members from various states in D.C. for the mission. Both Beckstrom and Wolfe were on orders in Washington since August, according to the West Virginia National Guard. Beckstrom, a resident of Summersville, West Virginia, had volunteered for the operation “to ensure the safety and security of our nation’s capital,” the West Virginia National Guard said in a statement. She had graduated from Webster County High School in June 2023 and enlisted with the guard that month, serving “with distinction” as a military police officer, the guard said. Wolfe, who is from Martinsburg, West Virginia, entered service in February 2019. He had graduated from Musselman High School as part of the Class of 2019, said Karla Troppman, a spokesperson for Berkeley County Schools in West Virginia. Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued a proclamation Friday requesting that all West Virginians observe a statewide moment of silence or prayer at 2:15 p.m. to honor Wolfe and Beckstrom. He also ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in recognition of Beckstrom’s death. Wolfe serves with the 167th Force Support Squadron and Beckstrom served with the 863rd Military Police Company, the governor said in a news release. “These two West Virginia heroes were serving our country and protecting our nation’s capital when they were maliciously attacked,” Morrisey said. “Their courage and commitment to duty represent the very best of our state.” In an interview on Fox News, Pirro said there are “many charges to come” beyond the upgraded murder charge. She said her heart goes out to the family of Beckstrom, who volunteered to serve and “ended up being shot ambush-style on the cold streets of Washington, D.C., by an individual who will now be charged with murder in the first degree.” Pirro declined to discuss the suspect’s motive, saying officials have been working around the clock on that question. Investigators are continuing to execute warrants in the state of Washington and other parts of the country, she said. She said Wolfe remains in critical condition and that “we still have hope.” “We are doing everything we can to assist his family and to make sure that they have everything they need during this difficult time for them,” Pirro said. Lakanwal, 29, had worked in a special CIA-backed Afghan Army unit before emigrating from Afghanistan, according to two sources who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, and #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the two-decade war. He entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said. Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, but his asylum was approved under the Trump administration, #AfghanEvac said in a statement. Supporters have said there was extensive vetting and the program offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals. Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, announced Friday that charges against a man who authorities say shot two National Guard members have been upgraded to first-degree murder. The announcement comes after the death of one of the soldiers. Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, were hospitalized in critical condition after Wednesday afternoon’s shooting and Trump announced Thursday evening that Beckstrom had died. As of Thursday morning, Rahmanullah Lakanwal faced charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, but Pirro suggested that the charges would be upgraded to first-degree murder if the victims did not survive. Pirro said that Lakanwal drove across the country to launch an “ambush-style” attack with a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver.

People who work with refugees are worried that those who fled dangerous situations to start again in America will face backlash after authorities say an Afghan national shot two National Guard soldiers this week, killing one of them. Many Afghans living in the U.S. are afraid to leave their houses, fearing they’ll be swept up by immigration officials or attacked with hate speech, said Shawn VanDiver, president of the San Diego-based group #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the two-decade war. “They’re terrified. It’s insane,” VanDiver told The Associated Press Thursday. “People are acting xenophobic because of one deranged man. He doesn’t represent all Afghans.

Katy Perry channels Thanksgiving in festive outfit,"November 29, 2025 Katy Perry brought some festive joy to Thanksgiving this year, and she did it in her own quirky style. On Nov. 27, the 41-year-old singer showed off a creative holiday look that immediately grabbed fans’ attention. She posted a video on Instagram wearing a blue beret decorated with a miniature Thanksgiving meal on top. The tiny setup included a table setting with turkey, mashed potatoes, peas, cranberry sauce, bread and even pumpkin pie. She ended the clip by saying, “Hatty Thanksgiving.” Fans quickly jumped into the comments and made playful references to her hit song Bon Appétit. One fan wrote, “We’re eating GOOD today! BON APPETIT BABY!!,” while another chimed in, “Bon appetit baby.” Perry is currently overseas on her Lifetimes Tour and spent the holiday in Shanghai, China. In another post, she shared moments from her visit to the Shanghai Disney Resort where she rode rides, met characters, watched fireworks and enjoyed Minnie Mouse-shaped waffles. She captioned her post, “How I spent my Thanksgiving on The Lifetimes Tour, Thank you @shanghaidisneyresort for making us feel so at home.” Along with her focus on touring, Perry is also making headlines for her new romance with former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. Radar Online reported that her friends are worried she may be moving too fast. While the singer is said to be excited about her future with Trudeau, insiders claim the politician has been dealing with changes in his personal life and may not be in the best place for a serious commitment. Trudeau ended his marriage to Sophie after 18 years and Perry recently split from Orlando Bloom in June. She and Bloom share daughter Daisy Dove, 5.

Max Brosmer to start for Vikings in Seattle — plus more injury news,"It's official: Rookie QB Max Brosmer will make his first NFL start for the Vikings on Sunday afternoon in Seattle. J.J. McCarthy did not clear the concussion protocols and has been ruled out for the contest, Kevin O'Connell announced on Friday. Brosmer signed with the Vikings as an undrafted free agent this spring after spending one season as the starter at the University of Minnesota. Before that, the 24-year-old spent five years at FCS New Hampshire, including three full healthy seasons as their starter. Due to injuries to McCarthy and then Carson Wentz, Brosmer has spent most of this season one snap away as the Vikings' backup QB. Now he'll get his first opportunity to play. Brosmer had a strong preseason, and the Vikings have raved about his ability to process what's going on and deliver accurate, in-rhythm throws. ""He's done everything to be ready when his number has been called,"" O'Connell said of Brosmer on Wednesday. ""He'll be ready if that's what takes place on Sunday, and I'll have a lot of confidence in him if that's what happens."" ""He's definitely a good quarterback,"" Justin Jefferson said. ""To be able to fit in with this offense and create a spark for us, that's something that we really need right now."" It's a tough spot for a QB to make his first career start. The Vikings are 11.5-point underdogs for this road game against the 8-3 Seahawks, who have one of the best pass rushes and overall defenses in the league. But considering how poorly McCarthy has played in recent weeks, the bar isn't very high for Brosmer to potentially provide and upgrade and spark the Vikings' offense, even in a tough matchup. John Wolford is expected to be elevated from the practice squad to serve as Brosmer's backup. Unfortunately, McCarthy is far from the Vikings' only injured player this week. Also ruled out for Sunday's game is left guard Donovan Jackson (ankle), who didn't practice all week. That means Blake Brandel will get the start at LG. Five players are listed as questionable, including some of the Vikings' most important players: LT Christian Darrisaw (foot), OLB Jonathan Greenard (shoulder), DT Jalen Redmond (hip), S Josh Metellus (knee/shoulder), and S Theo Jackson (neck). If Darrisaw can't go, Justin Skule would get the start at left tackle, which would mean Brosmer would be playing behind multiple backups on the offensive line. Greenard is hoping to return after missing the last two games. Redmond has been a surprise star and the Vikings' best defensive tackle this season. If either Metellus or Theo Jackson are out, Jay Ward would be in line for an expanded role at safety. We'll find out the statuses of those five players when the Vikings' inactive list is revealed at around 1:35 p.m. on Sunday, 90 minutes before kickoff.

Norris disappointed in third as Piastri takes sprint pole,"Series leader Lando Norris struggled to contain his disappointment after qualifying third for Saturday's sprint race at the Qatar Grand Prix where McLaren team-mate and title rival Oscar Piastri took pole. The 26-year-old Briton, who leads Piastri and Red Bull's four-time champion Max Verstappen by 24 points in the title race, can clinch his first drivers' title if he out-scores them both by two points this weekend. ""It's impossible to overtake here, so I think I'm probably going to finish P3,"" said an unusually stony-faced Norris on Friday. ""But if I can at least get past George (Russell, of Mercedes) off the line then that's probably the most I can hope for."" He said his lap had been compromised by a tussle with Williams' Alex Albon. ""Yeah, but that's life,"" he conceded before lamenting that his only mistakes had cost him a chance of pole in an effort to repeat his success in Sao Paulo where he took pole and won both the sprint race and the Grand Prix. ""I think the pace was there, I just made a mistake in the last corner on my first lap and didn't put it together for the second."" - Return to form - Asked by Sky Sports F1 how he viewed his prospects in the sprint race, which is worth eight points for the winner, he said: ""I'd be stupid not to try and win. ""I'm here to win so we’ll see what we can find overnight and see what we can do for the race tomorrow.” As Norris analysed his possibilities, Piastri smiled after finally feeling he had returned to form and could end a nightmare run of seven disappointing races without a win since the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August. In that time, the 24-year-old Australian has seen his series lead of more than 30 points turned into a 24-point deficit. ""It's been a good day, which is nice for a change,"" said Piastri. ""It's been just a day where things have clicked from the start and I think the sprint session went really well. ""I had a pretty big moment on my lap, but it was just enough at the end. Thanks to the team, for a great car and we've looked really good this weekend so far so I'm pretty happy with that. ""At the moment, I'm just happy with the result. There are a few things to try and target, but it's nice to be able to say that when you're starting on pole. ""I'm looking forward to tomorrow -- obviously it's only sprint pole and a few points , but I'll take whatever I can get."" str/ea",2025-11-28 20:06:53,Yahoo!

Luis Enrique On Liverpool Radar As Pressure Mounts On Arne Slot,"Liverpool look wobblier than anyone expected. The reigning champions have lost 9 of their last 12 matches across all competitions, a collapse that has turned confident headlines into anxious questions about the manager’s future and the club’s direction. Reports claim Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique sits high on Liverpool’s long-term wish list, but the Spaniard is not being lined up to replace Arne Slot immediately. The nuance matters. Liverpool apparently want Enrique when he becomes available rather than ripping up the job midseason. That reality does not stop the heat on Slot from burning bright. Luis Enrique ticks most of the boxes elite clubs look for. He has a Champions League pedigree, a clear tactical identity from his Barcelona years, and a reputation for extracting maximal output from top-end talent. PSG’s project also gives him exposure to managing superstar egos and a high-pressure, day environment. Those credentials make him an attractive long-term option for owners who like stability paired with a proven blueprint. Recent reports suggest Liverpool views Enrique as a priority target for the coming years, only when he leaves PSG, rather than as a short-term fix to salvage the current campaign. The practical barrier is obvious. Enrique is contracted at PSG, and extracting elite coaches from modern powerhouses requires patience and financial readjustment. Liverpool’s board would need to time any approach carefully to avoid destabilising ongoing competitions and to respect contractual realities. That cautious approach explains why the club might publicly back Slot today while quietly compiling a long list of potential successors for the medium term. Arne Slot has not been immune to scrutiny. The statistical collapse is stark. Liverpool’s run of defeats is their worst long-term stretch since the 1953- 54 season, according to independent match records, which explains the intensity of calls for answers from pundits, former players, and sections of the fanbase. Slot has faced criticism for tactical choices, late-game management, and how the new squad has gelled after a major summer of spending. High-profile voices have offered contrasting perspectives, with some advocating patience and others demanding immediate action. Slot remains defiant in public. He has pledged to fight on, pointed to the dressing room commitment, and underlined that players remain focused. The board has reportedly held meetings with Slot and his coaching team, and insiders suggest internal conversations are still ongoing rather than headline-grabbing reckonings. That said, urgency among supporters is rising because the results are not just isolated slips; they are a prolonged slide that threatens both domestic and European ambitions. If the board evaluates risk in two buckets, short-term rescue versus long-term stability, the current mood points toward a holding pattern. Replace the manager midseason, and you accept short-term turbulence but potentially galvanise the squad. Wait for a long-term target like Enrique, and you risk watching the campaign unravel further. That trade-off is the central drama at Anfield right now. Luis Enrique’s arrival would be a seismic statement. He favours fluid attacking patterns, positional rotation, and intense pressing off the ball when the team commits to his system. He also demands tactical discipline, which could suit a squad currently drifting in key moments. On the other hand, Enrique’s methods require time to take effect and significant buy-in from players who may be accustomed to different tactical habits under Slot. A midseason transition to Enrique would therefore be high risk and possibly unnecessary if Slot can arrest the slide soon. The realism of an Enrique appointment depends on timing. PSG’s managerial situation and Enrique’s contract status will be decisive. Reports that name him as a future target are often framed as future planning rather than a present say yes. Liverpool’s recruitment team appears to be assembling a list that blends pragmatic short-term options alongside long-term candidates who can be lured once their current commitments end. That strategy tracks with how elite clubs plan succession in modern football. Practical pressure points matter too. Liverpool spent heavily in the summer and has introduced major signings such as Florian Wirtz, Alexander Isak, and Hugo Ekitike into the spine of the team. Those players are at Liverpool now and deserve stability to settle. Wirtz joined in June 2025 as a marquee midfield signing, while Ekitike arrived in the same window as a big attacking investment. Uprooting the manager immediately risks interrupting an integration process that the club has only recently started. Any decision will weigh the sunk cost of transfers against the cost of ongoing decline. The immediate run of fixtures becomes a form of trial by fire. Slot needs tangible points to quieten calls for change. High-stakes domestic games and the next Champions League matches will shape boardroom thinking. If Liverpool picks up positive results, the argument for continuity strengthens. Continued defeats sharpen the case for dramatic action. Media voices and ex-players will continue to amplify either narrative, depending on results, which creates a feedback loop of pressure in the public sphere. A logical compromise exists. The club could publicly back Slot for now while accelerating recruitment and planning to approach Enrique when PSG timing permits. That route preserves short-term calm and prepares for a long-term upgrade if the owner thinks Enrique is the man for the future. Alternatively, the club could opt for an interim manager to steady the ship and delay any long-term appointment until the summer. Either route requires clear communication to the dressing room to avoid the morale-sapping uncertainty that often accompanies managerial limbo. Liverpool sits at a crossroads. The board has to choose between patience and immediate intervention. Luis Enrique is an attractive long-term target, and Liverpool appears to have him on a future wish list. Slot’s position is fragile because the results are indisputable. For now, the sensible reading is that this story is more about long-term planning than an imminent swap. The next few weeks will reveal whether that plan remains feasible or turns into the kind of midseason drama Anfield has not seen in decades.

UK Championship snooker referee is banned from officiating one player at the tournament,"A top snooker referee is barred from taking charge of one player's matches at the UK Championship - because she is married to him. Belarus-born Tatiana Woollaston, 38, will be one of the officials on duty at the first Triple Crown event of the season, which begins on Saturday. Another Woollaston will also be involved at the York Barbican, her husband Ben, who booked his place in the 32-player showpiece by coming through qualifying earlier this week. He is now looking forward to a first-round clash with three-time UK champion John Higgins on Saturday night. However, there is no chance of Tatiana taking charge of the match. She told the Mirror ahead of last year's UK Championship that they try to keep their respective snooker careers as separate as possible.

With the two-table set-up in play until the semi-final stage, she could conceivably referee while Ben is playing, although she is unlikely to be put in that position. Tatiana is also free to take charge of matches in her husband’s half of the draw. She had the honour of taking charge of last year's UK final between Judd Trump and Barry Hawkins. Ben, the world number 37, arrived in York on a high after a dramatic final qualifying round victory over fellow Leicester potter Joe O'Connor, coming from 4-1 down to win 6-5. After a 67-minute final frame, which finished after midnight, Ben said: ""That was probably the craziest match I have ever been involved in. ""I played really well from 4-1 down but it felt everything was going against me. Then Joe had me in a lot of trouble when he needed snookers at the end. I have lost a lot of deciders this season so it's nice to win one like that."" World number one Trump begins the defence of his title against Stephen Maguire on Saturday afternoon.

Cecil Paul Schremp,"Birth: 1941 Death: 2025 Devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, “Paul” passed peacefully at home, surrounded by family. He was preceded in death by his parents, Wilbert & Glenaire Schremp; brother, Clyde Schremp; wife of 31 years, Jeanne Marian Gubrud-Schremp; stepson, David Michael Minerd; and great-granddaughter, Peyton Joy Watkins. Paul is survived by his children, daughter, Robin Lynn Loranger-Holderman (Stephen), Westminster, CA, and son, Bryan Paul Schremp (Diana), Woodinville, WA. Two brothers, Wilbert Aaron Schremp, Jr., Grand Rapids, MI, and Sherman Lee Schremp, Thousand Oaks, CA; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren. Two stepsons, Timothy Francis Minerd (Pamala), Burgess, SC; Steven Kent Minerd (Evelyn), Mesa, AZ; numerous cousins, nieces, and nephews. Most people called him Paul, but he was also known as Dad, Papa, Tall Paul, Firebug, and “Just a Cool Guy,” charming most with his wry smile and easy-going nature. Born in Perryville, MO, he walked miles to church and the one-room schoolhouse he and his siblings attended. As a child, he fished on the Mississippi and explored caves, lakes, and valleys. This ignited his desire to adventure the world – traveling to continents near and far. His love of all things fast & furious brought him to adventures with Mickey Thompson Racing in the 50s, contributing his mechanical expertise to the car build that achieved land speed records. He raced in the Baja 1000 and ran his Baja bug over the Rubicon. He built numerous vehicles with friends and family, sharing his knowledge. He could tinker any “broken” machine into working order and often used duct tape and baling wire to get the job done! Many weekends were spent creating memories with family & friends at Pismo Beach, Glamis Dunes, Salton Sea, and the Mojave Desert, exploring the various terrains that California has to offer. As a sheet metal worker, he fearlessly scaled the rooftops of the Getty Museum, John Wayne Airport, light rail stations, and other structures around L.A. and Orange County. He received a distinction from the Local Union #105, having completed more than 60 years of membership. Paul was not an evangelist that would spout scripture, but was at church every Sunday (attendance coordinated around the NASCAR racing schedule when necessary!). He instead displayed his faith quietly, serving God in practical ways with Real Help, food bank bread runs, and countless church activities – always behind the scenes, providing hands-on support to communities & organizations. We are confident that Paul is driving the streets of gold – taking Jesus on the ride of his life! His legacy will be carried on within each of us and will remain as we gather for all the activities he shared.

Berney to retire as counseling point man,"After more than three decades leading Palouse River Counseling, Executive Director Mike Berney will be passing the reins of the organization he’s played a significant role in building to a new set of hands. Berney, the community behavioral health center’s senior-most member, announced he will be retiring in December. The Pullman-based nonprofit organization has chosen to promote Clinical Director Kathleen Stewardson to take over as executive director after conducting a national search. A lot has changed in the 40-plus years Berney has dedicated to help advance the region’s behavioral health services. Berney took over as head of what was once Whitman County Mental Health and later called Whitman County Counseling Services in the 1990s, not long after receiving his masters in business administration from Washington State University. Palouse River Counseling became its own private not-for-profit clinic in 2003 when Berney and county commissioners agreed the center would be able to provide better services as a separate organization independent from the county. Since then, Berney said it’s almost a “night and day difference” how much the clinic has evolved. The center’s biggest accomplishment, he said, is an increased ability to serve the community and people who need mental health care. The organization provides behavioral health services to adults, children and families across Whitman County. Berney said the center works with clients within their means, offering sliding scale payment to meet patients where they’re at. The clinic started out with around 20 staff, which Berney said has grown to more than 40 members consisting of psychologists, counselors, social workers, psychiatrists and nurses. With its expansion, the center is able to offer an array of outpatient resources including individual therapy, crisis intervention, substance abuse treatment, group sessions and medication management. Berney noted there’s been a culture shift around behavior health in a positive direction since he began in the field. While there is still some stigma in seeking counseling, Berney said people are more comfortable acknowledging they can benefit from the services as behavioral health continues to be talked about more. He said the topic has also become less stigmatized, especially as the public continues to use the term “mental health” as opposed to “mental illness.” Something he’s most happy to witness is behavioral health being seen as a part primary health care. He said the belief has gotten stronger that a person’s health is both physical and mental. Locally, Berney said the center, primary care practitioners in hospitals and law enforcement countywide have improved relationships in order to best respond to people in need. Berney said he’s optimistic for the future of mental health and Palouse River Counseling’s role in serving the community. “We’ve got a great group of people that work here,” he said. “I believe that the new executive director (will) carry on and make behavioral health services even more available to the residents of Pullman and Whitman County.” Pearce can be reached at epearce@dnews.com.",2025-11-29 08:05:00,The Lewiston Tribune Online,neutral,0.8315,6,Executive_Government_Plans," Palouse River Counseling Executive Director Mike Berney will be retiring in December .

'He is so invested': West Brom boss Mason praises matchwinner Molumby,"LOOK FAMILIAR:: Jayson Molumby of West Bromwich Albion makes a crying gesture as he celebrates after scoring a goal to make it 3-2 from 0-2 during the Sky Bet Championship match between West Bromwich Albion and Swansea City at The Hawthorns on November 29, 2025 in West Bromwich, United Kingdom. (Photo by Adam Fradgley/West Bromwich Albion FC via Getty Images) West Brom head coach Ryan Mason saluted match-winner Jayson Molumby after his side recovered from 2-0 down to beat Swansea 3-2 in their Sky Bet Championship clash at The Hawthorns. Ireland international midfielder Molumby, back from suspension after a red card against Coventry last week, struck after 85 minutes after Norway striker Aune Heggebo's double had dragged his side level. Struggling Swansea had rocked Albion with two goals in the first 11 minutes. Molumby celebrated his winner by sprinting to Mason in the technical area and embracing the head coach. ""He cares so much,"" said Mason. ""You can see that every day in training and he is so invested in this group and this club. ""But I would much rather that and have players making mistakes from a place of honesty and a real desire to help. ""I know Jayson respects me and the feeling is mutual. I love him as a person and he has a massive heart and works so hard. ""I'm pleased for him but especially for the group because everyone put so much work in."" Molumby's international compatriot Finn Azaz kept up his rich vein of form but it wasn't enough as his Southampton side were sickened late on. Tristan Crama struck the winning goal in the seventh minute of stoppage time as Millwall moved up to third in the table following a breathless 3-2 victory over Southampton at The Den. Caleb Taylor's screamer had put the Lions 2-1 in front but that was cancelled out by Azaz's scrambled equaliser in what was a brilliant spectacle. French defender Crama had the final word to inflict a first defeat under caretaker boss Tonda Eckert on the Saints and move the Lions to within two points of second-placed Middlesbrough. Coventry maintained their 10-point lead at the top of the Championship with a 3-1 victory over Charlton. Harvey Knibbs put the visitors ahead before Josh Eccles and Ellis Simms completed a first-half turnaround for the Sky Blues. Simms added his second with 15 minutes to go to make it five goals in three games for the Sky Blues front man. The Addicks, who have now conceded 11 in their last three outings, were handed a fourth defeat in a row after losses to Wrexham, Southampton and Stoke. Kim Hellberg made a winning start as Middlesbrough manager as the promotion chasers struck twice late on to fight back from behind and beat in-form Derby 2-1 at the Riverside. Boro found themselves behind inside 90 seconds when Patrick Agyemang struck for the Rams, but were rewarded for their second-half pressure when Newcastle loanee Matt Targett levelled 15 minutes from time. Morgan Whittaker then struck the winner nine minutes later with his third goal in three games. Mark Robins accused a member of Hull’s management team of inflaming a mass brawl at the end of Stoke’s 2-1 defeat at home to Hull. The incident followed the visitors sealing a comeback win via Joe Gelhardt’s last-gasp winner. Robins absolved his own players of blame, though several objects appeared to be thrown by home fans angered by visiting players celebrating in front of them. It was an unsavoury conclusion to a controversial game sparked by Sorba Thomas’s first-half wonder goal and a contentious Semi Ajayi equaliser after 47 minutes. “I spoke to the referee who said one of their players had incited the crowd by celebrating in front of them,” explained Robins. “The crowd has then got up. Ash [Phillips] got involved somehow. It then starts to calm down before one of their management team gets involved, says something, then it all lights again. It’s nothing to do with my players, but on the back of it we will get fined, which is an absolute joke.” Gerhard Struber hailed Bristol City’s 1-0 victory at Portsmouth as a “massive win for our confidence” as the Robins put their play-off push back on track. Anis Mehmeti’s 17th-minute header gave Struber’s side a deserved victory and dropped Pompey – who needed until the 78th minute to register their first shot on target – into the relegation zone. Preston came from behind twice to beat Sheffield Wednesday 3-2 in a pulsating game at Hillsborough. Charlie McNeill’s first-half double was cancelled out by Ben Whiteman and Lewis Dobbin, with the Owls striker missing a penalty moments before Mads Frokjaer-Jensen’s 76th-minute winner. Wednesday remain at the foot of the table on minus four points while Preston move up to fifth. Wrexham scored a dramatic late equaliser to earn a point in a 1-1 draw with Blackburn. The visitors thought they had won it through Andri Gudjohnsen’s early goal, but Max Cleworth struck in the fifth minute of second-half added time to remain unbeaten in the league since 18 October.

2025 Dodgers season review: Noah Davis,"Noah Davis had a rough start and rough finish to his tenure in the majors with the Dodgers. Acquired for cash considerations from the Boston Red Sox on March 27 — the date of the home opener for the Dodgers, and opening day for 28 MLB teams — Davis gave the Dodgers another relief pitcher with options, which was needed with several arms opening the season on the injured list. Davis rode the fresh arm express between Triple-A Oklahoma City and Los Angels up and down four times in three and a half months. The right-hander was active for 13 games and pitched in five of them. First was at Wrigley Field on April 22, a sloppy game that reached extra innings after Alex Vesia and Tanner Scott allowed home runs to tie the score at 10-10. After five relievers were already used, the Dodgers turned to Davis for the 10th, with an automatic runner at second base to open the frame. All it took was two pitches for Ian Happ to single home the winning run. The next day, the Dodgers lost another frustrating game in Chicago. Davis entered a bullpen game in the fourth inning with a two-run lead, and exited trailing by one after giving up two singles and a three-run home run to Pete Crow-Armstrong. Davis after this entered games in which the Dodgers trailed by three, five, and six runs. The first two were scoreless appearances, and then July 4 brought the fireworks, in a bad way. Trailing 7-1, Davis entered a bad situation in the fifth inning and stranded two runners to escape further damage, at least for that inning. In the sixth inning, it took seven batters for Davis to record the first out and by then, six more runs had scored. Officially in “take one for the team” mode, Davis was left in to finish the inning, but allowed four more runs. Davis threw 43 pitches in the inning, allowed four singles, two home runs, three walks, and hit a batter. He is just the second Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher to allow 10 runs in relief, joining Willard Hunter in San Francisco on April 16, 1962. The 18-1 defeat was the Dodgers’ worst blowout loss in Dodger Stadium history. Davis was optioned back to Triple-A the next day, and designated for assignment one week later to make roster room for waiver-claim Nick Nastrini. On July 15, the Dodgers traded Davis to the Twins for cash considerations. During his time with Oklahoma City, Davis had a 3.94 ERA and one save in 21 games, with 38 strikeouts and 15 walks in 32 innings. With the Twins, Davis split time between Minneapolis and Triple-A St. Paul. In four games with the Twins, Davis allowed 10 runs (nine earned) in five innings, with seven strikeouts and a walk. With an inconvenient seven home runs in 11 major league innings, Davis in 2025 had an 18.00 ERA, the fourth-highest in major league history among pitchers with at least 10 innings. Age: 28 Stats: 5 games, 6 IP, 14 runs (13 earned), 5 walks, 8 strikeouts Salary: unknown Davis struck out two in two scoreless innings against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Dodger Stadium on April 25. He walked a batter and hit another, but did not allow a hit. This was one of two Dodgers outings in which Davis pitched two scoreless innings, also doing so June 1 against the Yankees. Davis was sent outright to the minors by the Twins in September, and finished out the season with Triple-A St. Paul. As someone who was outrighted multiple times in his career (also in 2024 by the Colorado Rockies), Davis elected free agency once the season ended.",2025-11-29 20:07:00,Yahoo!

Real Madrid to ignore Joan Laporta’s “Barcelona-itis” remarks,"The last 24-48 hours in Spanish football has been dominated by a public war of words involving Real Madrid and Barcelona. It started on the back of comments made by Florentino Perez during last weekend’s General Assembly, and on Friday, a response came from his opposite number, Joan Laporta. Perez claimed that Barcelona are historically favoured by referees in La Liga, and in response, Laporta hit out at a supposed obsession that Real Madrid have with their El Clasico rivals. The situation has kept many onlookers interested, with many wondering how it will evolve over the coming days. However, it is about to end. As per Cadena Cope (via MD), Real Madrid do not intend to issue any further comment on the matter, outside of Xabi Alonso’s vague remarks during his press conference on Saturday. Image via Angel Martinez/Getty Images Real Madrid and Perez consider the matter closed, as they consider that “everything that had to be said was already said” during the Assembly last weekend. As such, there will be no further public comments on the matter from them, with it deemed not appropriate to reply to Laporta’s words. Off the pitch, Real Madrid and Barcelona had been in good relations, particularly due to their shared goal of launching the European Super League. However, things have turned sour over the last couple of years, particularly due to the Negreira case, with Los Blancos prepared to stand against their bitter rivals amid allegations of sporting corruption. Barcelona have also moved away from the Super League, as they prepare to realign themselves with UEFA and the ECA. This has left Real Madrid out of their own with A22, the controversial competition’s organisers, in seeking to get it off the ground over the next few months/years.",2025-11-29 20:07:00,Yahoo!

“We have the best site:” Contracts for Australia’s biggest wind project put out to tender,"Australia’s biggest retailer and the owner of the country’s biggest coal generator has put out tenders for contractors and turbine suppliers for what will likely be the nation’s biggest wind farm once built. Origin Energy is developing the Yanco Delta wind project in the south-west of NSW, with a planned capacity of 1.5 gigawatts, which would beat the 1.33 GW of the partially complete Golden Plains wind farm in Victoria. In an interview with Renew Economy’s weekly Energy Insiders podcast, Origin Energy CEO Frank Calabria says tenders for what will undoubtedly also be the most expensive renewable project in Australia are out in the market. “We’re in the midst right now (of) both turbine tenders and balance of plant (tenders),” Calabria said, when asked about the potential capital cost of the project, which Origin bought in 2024 for a total of $300 million. Energy Insider co-host David Leitch had suggest a number of between $3 million and megawatt and $3.5 million. That would put the total value of the project at around $5 billion. Calabria demurred on the cost question, because the company is in mid-tender process, but said this: “I feel very confident about the fact that we’ve got the best wind site in there, and the most economic,” Calabria told Energy Insiders. “It’s also a very large commitment.” Yanco Delta is located in the south-west renewable energy zone near the town of Jerildirie – in the electorate of federal Opposition Sussan Ley – and is the only project in that REZ to receive full grid access rights. It will require more than 200 turbines. Three other projects also obtained grid access rights, but took a hair cut in terms of capacity, while other major projects – some of the same size as Yanco Delta – lost out completely because of the limited capacity of the new zone, blamed on the undersizing of the new transmission link, Project EnergyConnect. One thing that is clear is that costs have gone up considerably since the last time Origin Energy set out on a large wind project, which was also the biggest in the country at the time. The 530 MW Stockyard Hill wind farm, the largest in the country until overtaken this year by Golden Plains, struck what was then being hailed in 2017 as a stunningly low off take price in the low $50s a megawatt hour. Since then, prices have doubled – thanks to the inflation fuelled mostly by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a global supply crunch. It is thought that capital costs of turbine parts may have peaked, but the wind industry, like all others, is also suffering from huge spikes in civil constructions costs. “We feel we’ve got the most economic wind project in the market, but the costs of constructing those and the PPA prices people want for those is actually quite, quite expensive right now in the system, and that’s actually probably been a more recent phenomena,” Calabria says. Origin Energy’s strategy is likely to take the Yanco Delta project to the point of construction and then find a buyer, with Origin being the major customer. It did a similar deal with Stockyard Hill. “Our intent would be that we would go through the development phase and therefore write the offtake contract and … then move most of that off balance sheet, and therefore recycle the capital so we could develop that into other assets we have,” Calabria said. He noted the company has other renewable assets, including in the New England REZ, where it has bought its own land and is looking to develop the Northern Tablelands wind project. “We continue to actively look at that,” he said. “It has been a sector that’s actually moved quite a lot, as you probably appreciate, in terms of the quality of the assets, the premium paid for those platforms and the opportunities and the timing they come to market. “But wind would be one where we would be actively involved in the development and then basically secure the energy for our portfolio and for our customers, and then recycle that back, where we have committed $1.7 billion in the last two years.” That has gone into battery storage, including the country’s biggest battery at Eraring – the soon to be commissioned 700 MW and 2,800 MWh facility – and the 300 MW, 650 MWh Mortlake battery next to its gas fired power station in Victoria. It has also written off-take deals for the giant Supernode battery near Brisbane, which will also overtake the Eraring battery to be the country’s biggest once complete. “We feel we’ve got the most economic wind project in the market, but the costs of constructing those and the PPA prices people want for those is actually quite, quite expensive right now in the system, and that’s actually probably been a more recent phenomena,” Calabria says. Origin has been criticised, including on this web-site and in the Energy Insiders podcast, for the lack of new wind and solar capacity it has built – zero – since it first announced in early 2022 (the last time Calabria was a guest of the Energy Insiders podcast) – the planned “early closure” of Eraring, which was then delayed from 2025 to at least 2027. Calabria says the transition has been slower than expected, and he points to the delays in transmission, and also the attention diverted to the proposed $20 billion takeover bid led by Brookfield, which was ultimately voted down by institutional shareholders despite the support of the board. “I think that we’ve got the balance about right in terms of this transition,” Calabria says. “It is all happening, though a little slower, and we’re still waiting for transmission to be built out.” To hear more of the interview, and Calabria’s comments on the future of the Eraring coal plant, which will be reported in a separate story, please go to the latest episode of the Energy Insiders podcast, to be published on Monday.",2025-11-30 08:06:00,Renew Economy,positive,0.7216,63,Client_Adsorbents_Ltd, Origin Energy CEO Frank Calabria says tenders for the Yanco Delta wind farm in NSW are out in the market .

"Ashes don’t need pink-ball Tests, says Joe Root","Pink-ball games have been part of Test cricket for a decade now, but one contemporary stalwart believes they are unnecessary, at least in an Ashes series. Ahead of the Brisbane Test starting on December 4, England great Joe Root has questioned whether the high-profile series needs a day-night game and all the various dynamics that come with it. “I personally don’t think so. It does add to things. It’s obviously very successful and popular here, and obviously Australia have got a very good record here as well. You can see why we’re playing one of those games and ultimately, you know from two years out [that] it is going to be there,” Root said before training at the Gabba on Sunday. “A series like this, does it need it? I don’t think so, but it doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be here either.” Root’s apprehension may have a basis in England’s prospects in the series. The upcoming Test will be the fourth in Ashes history to be played with a pink ball, with Australia winning the previous three. Overall, they have won all but one of the 14 such games. Their pace spearhead Mitchell Starc seems to get even deadlier with a pink ball in hand. England are already 0-1 down in the five-match series after the two-day defeat in Perth and desperately need to bounce back in Brisbane. A 0-2 deficit going into the third Test in Adelaide would severely jeopardise their ambitions of regaining the coveted urn. The pink-ball innovation was brought to boost Test match attendances and cater to TV viewership, with the latter part of the day’s play taking place during prime time. The first three days of the Brisbane Test are already sold out. Root has played each of England’s previous seven day-night Tests, captaining in six of them, and said they have to be aware of “how quickly the game can change” under floodlights. “At different phases of the day, it can feel quite placid and you can feel out of the game with the ball, and things can turn around,” the 34-year-old said. “Similarly, with the bat, [it is about] recognising those moments and utilising them as best you can: when to put the foot down and maximise the good batting conditions; similarly, being able to maximise it when it changes and how quickly it changes.” The second Ashes Test will be a novelty even in the limited history of pink-ball games as a lot more of the day’s play will be held in artificial light. The sun will set during the second session of play, while usually it’s the final session that’s played under floodlights. “It looks like we’ll have half of a day under floodlights. The twilight phase is in the middle session, when usually that comes around the back end of the second session and the start of the last session,” Root observed. “There will be different elements to contend with, but that is all part of the fun, right?

"UK, Russia, and Germany Dominate Turkey’s Tourism Market with Six Point Four Million Arrivals in 2025, While Bulgaria, Iran, and Other Markets Show Steady Growth","Published on November 30, 2025 In 2025, the tourism market in Turkey is being significantly shaped by the UK, Russia, and Germany, which collectively accounted for six point four million arrivals. This dominance is driven by strong historical ties, ease of travel, and Turkey’s appeal as a cultural and leisure destination. Meanwhile, countries like Bulgaria, Iran, and other emerging markets are also showing steady growth, contributing to a diverse and expanding tourism landscape in Turkey.Turkey saw a notable increase in Russian tourism during the first ten months of 2025, even as overall foreign arrivals to the country experienced a slight dip. Official data from the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism revealed a 2.25 percent increase in Russian visitors compared to the previous year. Notably, October stood out as the strongest month for Russian tourism, with a remarkable 11.4 percent surge, marking the highest monthly increase recorded for the year.Advertisement Between January and October 2025, Turkey welcomed 47.25 million foreign visitors, a slight 0.1 percent decrease compared to the same period in 2024. While the overall numbers dipped, the key source markets for Turkish tourism remained resilient. Russia regained the top spot with 6.39 million arrivals, registering a small increase over last year. Germany followed closely with 6.2 million visitors, a 1.9 percent increase, while the United Kingdom came in third, contributing 4.05 million visitors, a growth of 2.25 percent. Iran (2.55 million) and Bulgaria (2.31 million) rounded out the top five countries sending visitors to Turkey. Together, these five markets accounted for 45.5 percent of Turkey’s total foreign visitors.Antalya Dominates Russian TourismAntalya remains the leading destination for Russian travelers to Turkey. During the first ten months of 2025, the region welcomed 3.89 million Russian tourists, reflecting a 3.3 percent increase compared to last year. This represents 60.8 percent of the total Russian market share in Turkey. The city’s extended tourist season and strong reliance on all-inclusive offerings continue to make it a preferred destination for Russian holidaymakers. Its position as a prime resort area has solidified its role as the epicenter of Russian tourism in Turkey.While Antalya flourished, Muğla, another popular region, experienced a decline in Russian arrivals. The region saw 398,621 Russian visitors, reflecting a 2.5 percent drop and accounting for only 6.23 percent of the total Russian market. The decrease in Muğla is attributed to a shift in Russian tourism preferences, with more visitors opting for destinations offering better value for money and extended seasonal offerings, especially in Antalya.Istanbul Maintains Steady GrowthIstanbul, traditionally a cultural and commercial hub, continued to attract significant numbers of Russian travelers in 2025. Estimates suggest that the city received around 1.7 million Russian tourists, which accounted for 26.6 percent of the total Russian arrivals to Turkey. The city has remained a stable destination, offering a mix of city breaks, historical attractions, and air-transit connections for international flights. Istanbul’s position as a critical gateway for Russian visitors remains firm, even as other destinations continue to grow.Advertisement Further entry points into Turkey for Russian tourists were through regions like Trabzon, Izmir, and Ankara, as well as through the land border with Georgia. These regions together accounted for an additional 6.3 percent of Russian tourism, reflecting a diversification in entry points to Turkey.October: A Record Month for Russian TourismOctober 2025 emerged as the standout month for Russian tourism to Turkey. Of the 5.68 million foreign visitors that arrived in Turkey in October, 865,472 were Russians, marking an 11.4 percent increase in comparison to October 2024.

Antalya absorbed 67.4 percent of the total Russian arrivals in October, with the region posting a 12.3 percent increase, welcoming 583,044 visitors. The increase in Antalya was primarily driven by the extended season and its consistent appeal among Russian tourists seeking sun and relaxation. In contrast, Muğla continued to see a decline, with 40,191 visitors, a 10.7 percent drop from the previous year.Istanbul saw around 185,000 Russian arrivals in October, reflecting a 5.3 percent rise, and capturing 21.5 percent of the Russian market for the month.

Best gym wear trends to motivate you this winter,"From fold-over flares to hybrid trainers, here are the pieces set to define winter workouts. By PA/TPN, in Lifestyle · 30 Nov 2025, 08:06 · 0 Comments You may already be thinking about New Year’s resolutions. It might be something new, like learning to play the guitar, or it may be the age-old ‘get more active’. But there’s something about winter that makes getting to the gym feel harder – maybe it’s the cold mornings, the dark evenings or the lure of leftover Christmas chocolate. But good activewear can do wonders for motivation. So here are the biggest gym-wear trends to know this winter – from the new shape of leggings to the shoes that everyone’s wearing outside of spin class. Fold-over flares and asymmetric tops “While leggings will always reign supreme,” says Fabletics‘ director of buying Frances Fountain, “we have seen a real shift towards fold-over, wide-leg workout pants – they’re comfy, flattering and feel fresh after seasons of skin-tight styles.” After years of compressive leggings, the pendulum has definitely swung the other way. The return of the flared silhouette brings a sense of the Noughties back to studio dressing, particularly for yoga and Pilates. Tops, meanwhile, are going more avant-garde and more feminine. “Lightweight layering pieces are having a moment,” says Fountain. “We love ruched cross-back designs for that new Pilates girl vibe, and off-shoulder sweats are super cute for throwing on before or after class.” Figure-hugging tops with more design details like intricate straps or asymmetric necklines are trending, and elevate your gym look into something that doesn’t look like you’re recycling an old pyjama top. Head-to-toe burgundy Burgundy has been dubbed the colour of the season for this winter and it’s now finally migrated to gym wear. “Burgundy is huge!” says Fountain, “you’re seeing it everywhere on the high street and now it’s officially gym-approved too.” Deep, earthy tones like chocolate, plum and forest green are this season’s go-tos. “We are also loving Christmassy hues done in a modern way,” says Fountain. “Deep greens, rich reds and warm, festive shades feel perfect for winter workouts.” Credits: PA; Cable-knit sweats and soft fleeces Cable knit may sound counterproductive as an activewear fabric, but ribbed wool and bouclé-style knits are dominating gym wear layers, just look at Kendall Jenner’s viral Alo Yoga collaboration, which leans heavily into these soft-focus textures. “For me, it’s all about winter comfort,” says Fountain, “I’m living in cosy fleece jumpers and soft sweats that still look put-together.” She says anything “super soft, easy to throw on and just the right amount of cropped”, is this season’s biggest outerwear trend. The cropped-fleece silhouette which sits neatly above high-waisted leggings or fold-over flares is becoming the unofficial uniform of post-workout coffee runs. Cosy, but cool enough to wear all day long. Hybrid trainers So if you haven’t clocked so far, versatility is leading the trends this season, and trainers are no longer confined to the gym floor. Fountain says “it’s less about gym-only trainers this year and more about hybrid sneakers you can wear anywhere.” It’s the shift we’ve seen across fashion, functional comfort reimagined as part of an everyday uniform. “Around the office we are all pairing Nike Air Rifts with our activewear – they give that sporty-street mix we love,” she says. Retro styles like slimline trainers or the new ‘sneakerina’ are also big. “T90s and Speedcat ballet slippers are huge right now,” Fountain notes – a nod to the 2000s sports aesthetic that’s finding its way back into Pilates studios and beyond. So the guideline for trainer trends this season is to find something that looks as good with a trench coat and coffee as it does on the treadmill.

Cougars extend their season with Pac-12 victory over Oregon State,"PULLMAN — In a season in which so much had gone wrong for the Washington State football team, almost everything went right in the Cougars’ season finale Saturday at Gesa Field. The stout Cougar defense contained its lone Pac-12 rival to one touchdown, the offense left its second-half sorrows in the past with 13 post-intermission points and WSU beat the Beavers 32-8 to secure its sixth victory and bowl game eligibility. The Cougars (6-6) honored 25 seniors, including five who spent five years at WSU and a slew of guys who followed Rogers and company from South Dakota State to Pullman. “Proud of this group of seniors for the way they’ve really fought the whole season and kept the team connected,” WSU coach Jimmy Rogers said. “A lot of things went right tonight.” A defensive exclamation point With the Washington State defense pitching a shutout midway through the third quarter versus the Beavers (2-10), The CW Network cameras captured a rare sight. A smiling Rogers. When Washington State’s overwhelming pass rush, in this moment headlined by seniors Darrion Dalton and Parker McKenna, brought Oregon State freshman quarterback Tristan Ti’a to the ground, Rogers, typically stoic, was beaming at the prospect of his defense disrupting an Oregon State drive that had reached midfield. In his ear was likely a pumped-up WSU defensive coordinator, Jesse Bobbit and company. “I was just excited that the defensive staff gets fired up,” Rogers said. “It’s a joy to listen to them find excitement.” He had a lot to smile about in WSU’s regular-season finale. WSU senior linebacker Caleb Francl forced a fumble on Oregon State’s opening drive, which McKenna recovered. Then, Francl secured a turnover solo, jumping a pass from Ti’a for his second interception in as many weeks. The pick was Ti’a’s first collegiate interception in his first career start. WSU cornerback Colby Humphrey flashed his juggling skills when he batted a rogue ball from Ti’a once, twice, thrice and four times before finally securing the interception. The Cougars totaled six sacks and seven players registered at least half a sack. Junior defensive end Isaac “Bobby” Terrell accounted for six total tackles and 1.5 sacks. A school record for Freeman The announcement was uttered over the Gesa Field PA system six times or so. No. 0 Tony Freeman donned a No. 39 jersey for each of his six punt returns. Freeman made the switch because WSU redshirt freshman linebacker Anthony Palano, who also wears No. 0, was on the Cougars’ coverage unit. Freeman, a wide receiver who racked up a team-high 84 receiving yards on seven catches Saturday, made his biggest impact in the punt return game, totaling a single-game WSU record with 169 yards on six returns. The junior speedster recorded a long of 59 yards and had a 43-yard return early in the second quarter, which set up Kirby Vorhees’ rushing touchdown that made it 13-0. Freeman said he had worn No. 37 in practice, but found that he could not change into it as fast, so he made the switch to a bigger jersey — a detail which proved to be pretty important. “Countless times, literally every third down. ‘T free, T free, you gotta put on 39,’” Freeman said of switching numbers for punt returns. “I’m like, ‘Here we go again.’ But it was honestly just a blessing. We gotta wear 39 a little bit more if I’m starting to do that in that.” A chippy rivalry Former WSU coach Jake Dickert once said that the WSU and OSU football teams were not buddies. One year and a coaching change later, both the Cougars and the Beavers seem to have taken that sentiment to heart. The two teams chirped all game long. WSU senior safety Tucker Large, ever the impressive trash talker, was ejected after officials charged him with two unsportsmanlike penalties. Large accounted for two pass breakups before leaving the game in the fourth quarter. Washington State quarterback Eckhaus said that the Beavers had some choice words for the Cougs during their last encounter. “It was all talk, because you see the scoreboard. I guess that makes us the Pac-2 champs, or Pac-12 champs,” said Eckhaus, who passed for nearly 200 yards, ran for 63 and accounted for a passing and a rushing touchdown. “One of their players said, ‘This isn’t a rivalry game.’ ... Well, we just won, so I guess this is a rivalry game.” One more game The Cougars are bowl-bound and that means an awful lot to Rogers and everyone involved in the WSU football program. “To be bowl eligible is huge for us, because the players can keep faith in what we are building,” Rogers said. “We lost four games at the point differential of 12 points and that’s what stings.” The Cougars will continue to practice this week before receiving news of their bowl assignment next weekend. This is the final year of the Pac-12’s existing affiliations with a slew of bowl games. At 6-6, WSU could be bound for the L.A. or New Mexico bowls. Wherever the Cougars are going, they are thankful to have a few more weeks together as a football team. “We’re deserving of a bowl game, and I’m glad that we got that win,” Eckhaus said. “Really grateful to get to spend more time with these guys (and get) one more game with these guys.” Washington St. 32, Oregon State 8 First Quarter WSU — FG Stevens 26, 9:21.

Many Brits are just discovering wild fact about the Scottish flag,"Today, November 30, marks Saint Andrew's Day, a celebration in honour of Andrew the Apostle, Scotland's patron saint and reportedly one of Jesus's disciples. As part of Scotland's Winter Festival, Scots come together to pay tribute to their rich culture, heritage, and customs with traditional food, music, dancing, and merriment. A symbol deeply rooted in Scottish identity is the country's flag, also known as the St Andrew's Cross or the Saltire, featuring a white saltire against a blue backdrop. According to legend, the flag's origins date back to the Battle of Athelstaneford in 832 AD, where King Angus and his men saw a white cross appear in the sky. The king vowed to make Saint Andrew the patron saint of Scotland if they emerged victorious, adopting the cross as their banner. The X-shaped cross is said to represent the one on which Saint Andrew was martyred. Interestingly, many are only just discovering that Scotland's flag holds the distinction of being Europe's oldest national flag. One Reddit user shared their newfound knowledge: ""Many of you may already know this, but I wanted to share this fact. Scotland is Europe's oldest flag, it originated in 832 AD."" The revelation sparked a flurry of fascinated responses, with one Reddit user confessing: ""I didn't know any of this until I Googled after reading your post, so thanks for that!"" Another enthusiast chimed in: ""Ancient peoples really understood the power of putting white lines on strong colours."" However, not everyone was convinced, with some arguing that the Danish flag is actually the oldest. While the Danish flag's design dates back to 1219, Scotland's flag has its roots in 832 AD, but the proof of continuous use of the iconic white saltire on a blue background comes later, casting doubt on which flag truly holds the title. The first recorded instance of Scotland's flag sporting the white-on-blue design was around 1542. Saint Andrew's Day celebrations are about more than just proudly flying the flag, though. They're also an excuse for ceilidhs, which are traditional parties featuring Scottish folk music, dancing, and storytelling. Expect recitals of Robert Burns's poetry too, as well as feasts of haggis, neeps and tatties, and clootie dumpling. There's also plenty of tartan, kilts, and blue-and-white face paint as the Scots celebrate their patron saint in style.",2025-11-30 08:06:00,Dailystar Co Uk,neutral,0.4956,47,Simwa_Better_Flag," November 30 marks Saint Andrew's Day, a celebration in honour of Andrew the Apostle .

More precisely, he revealed that certain veterans executed pranks so harsh that he often felt sympathetic towards the victims, even describing the ""trio"" as ""brutal"" to subtly highlight the severity of their pranks.

Sidelines empty and helmets fly as Jaguars-Titans brawl erupts following returning star’s late hit on former teammate,"It all kicked off in the Jacksonville Jaguars-Tennessee Titans game, with two brawls between the teams With seconds remaining on the clock in the second quarter, a brawl ensued between the two teams following a late hit on Jags quarterback Trevor Lawrence. The contact, initiated by Titans linebacker Arden Key against his former quarterback, saw tempers flare as Jaguars offensive tackle Anton Harrison took exception to the hit. The two got physical with helmets coming off as the altercation went into the Jags sideline. The NFL officials threw a penalty flag calling Key for roughing the passer, but no ejections were handed out. The penalty allowed the Jaguars to get into field goal range, with Cam Little converting from 45 yards as the clock hit zero to give Jacksonville an 18-3 lead at the half. ""That forearm to the head & neck area will get a flag every time. Completely unnecessary & Cam Little made 'em pay,"" one fan wrote on X (formerly Twitter). ""Arden Key just salty he not playing with us 🤣,"" a second Jags fan posted, referencing that the Titans LB once donned the teal uniform. ""They might take away Arden’s key to the city for that one,"" a third commented. Even the Jaguars' social media account couldn't help themselves, captioning their half-time post with the two-word caption ""Keep swinging."" The teams were as good as their word, and they were back for more of the same in the fourth quarter. With 11:30 remaining, and the Jags having pulled into a 25-3 lead, Chimere Dike fielded a punt and having made small yardage, picked himself up only for the cameras to swing to midfield. A second scuffle had broken out, forcing officials to send the flags flying once again. This time there appeared to be little significant contact, and once again no ejections, as the teams separated into two pockets with plenty of grabbing and pulling. It proved to be the last meaningful act of the contest as the game petered out with no additions to the scoring, seeing the Jags improve to 8-5 on the season. The Titans meanwhile remain with just a solitary win to their name, and now look a strong favorite to hold the number one pick for the second year in succession. The Jags are now tied with the Colts at the top of the AFC South, but Indianapolis lost their second game in succession, and their third in four games. This time it was at the hands of the surging Houston Texans who improve to 7-5 and are now just one game behind the Colts and Jags in an AFC South, which now looks like it will be a fight to the finish. Jacksonville has now won three straight games, and host the Colts in Week 14 knowing a win would give them a one game advantage with just three remaining on the season. Lawrence produced one of his cleaner games of the season, throwing 16-of-27 for 229 yards and two touchdowns, with the former No. 1 overall draft pick also rushing for 28 yards on three carries. On the other side of the ball, rookie quarterback - and the No. 1 overall pick of the 2025 draft - Cam Ward could amass just 141 yards from 24 of-38 passing.

Netflix just added 29 new shows and movies — here are the 5 I'd start binge-watching now,"Netflix is adding 29 new shows and movies to the streaming service today (Dec. 1). Given that Netflix often doesn't add that much in an entire week, it'd be understandable if you didn't know where to start. Lucky for you, I've already gone through the list and found five shows and movies worth watching right now. I was able to find a blend of new Netflix originals and older classics being added that are worthy of streaming. There's a new interview between comedy legends David Letterman and Adam Sandler that's a must-watch, and a new monster movie sequel I'm hoping can live up to the original. Netflix has also added a few of the greatest movies ever made, and they're definitely worth watching. If you're looking for more to watch, read my guide to everything new to Netflix in December and check out the 5 best Netflix shows of 2025 to binge right now. Malcolm has been covering the latest in streaming shows and movies since 2023. Every week, he hunts down the top shows and movies to watch on Netflix. If I tell you ""There's no crying in baseball,"" there's a good chance you'll have heard the line before, even if you've never seen ""A League of Their Own."" Tom Hanks' iconic line is just one of many reasons this is one of the best baseball movies ever made. It tells the (mostly) true story of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League that started up during World War II, in particular, the Rockford Peaches. This team was one of the founding members of the league, and even though they've long stopped playing ball, this movie ensures their name continues to live on. But Hanks isn't the only reason this movie is a must-watch. ""A League of Their Own"" has a star-studded cast of actresses playing members of the Peaches, including Geena Davis as Dorothy ""Dottie"" Hinson, Madonna as ""All the Way"" Mae Mordabito, Lori Petty as Kit Keller and Rosie O’Donnell as Doris Murphy. It even inspired a short-lived but well-liked Amazon Prime Video TV show that, unfortunately, had its run cancelled far too quickly. Stream ""A League of Their Own"" on Netflix now David Letterman is, undoubtedly, one of the best interviewers of all time, and after leaving the world of late-night television, he's taken his talents to Netflix. In ""My Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman,"" Letterman sits down with a guest so famous, you probably know who they are. His roster of former guests includes presidents of countries, NBA stars and, after this week, it'll include the legendary actor Adam Sandler. Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips. Over the 60-minute episode of this Emmy Award-winning show, Letterman and the Sandman will engage in a long-form conversation, interspersed with in-the-field pre-taped segments. If you want a taste of what to expect, check out Letterman's previous episode with comedian John Mulaney, or watch any of the hilarious interviews Letterman did with Sandler on the ""Late Show."" Stream ""My Next Guest with David Letterman and Adam Sandler"" on Netflix now Told in a non-linear format, ""Pulp Fiction"" stars Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta as Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, hitmen working for local gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). It also stars Bruce Willis as prizefighter Butch Coolidge and Uma Thurman as Wallace's wife, Mia. With plenty of other incredible castmates, tons of violence and a sprinkling of drug use, this crime movie tells its three interwoven storylines across seven parts, each as captivating as the last. Incredibly, I don't think I've ever written about ""Pulp Fiction"" for Tom's Guide. That's not to say we haven't covered it; the acclaimed 1994 crime drama has made it into many a list of movies to watch on our site. It won the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was later nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It ultimately only won Best Original Screenplay, but it is still considered perhaps the greatest independent movie ever made. Stream ""Pulp Fiction"" on Netflix now Speaking of drug use in incredible movies, it doesn't get much better than Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" Based on real events, this black comedy biopic stars Leonardo DiCaprio as notorious stockbroker Jordan Belfort. Starting in the late 1980s, the movie chronicles Belfort's rise from a broker fired on Black Monday, through his time as a penny stocks pusher, all the way up until his pump and dump schemes at his firm Stratton Oakmont ultimately get him sent to a cushy minimum security prison. This movie is incredible, considered not only one of the best movies of the year, but one of the best movies of the 2010s by numerous critics. It features what might be the best performance of DiCaprio's career, as well as possibly the best performance of Margo Robbie's career as Belfort's wife. Jonah Hill is also incredible as the drug-addled neurotic Donnie Azoff, though I think his best performance is probably still ""Moneyball."" If you've never seen this film before, or just haven't seen it in a while, make time to watch it. Stream ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" on Netflix now Recommending ""Troll 2"" is a tricky prospect. On the one hand, it's the follow-up to ""Troll,"" a 2022 epic monster movie that was largely liked by critics but received mixed responses from audiences. On the other hand, this sequel to the fantastical Norwegian film doesn't have any reviews yet, so I'll be honest that I can't tell you for sure that this will be worth watching. Nonetheless, I'm calling my shot and saying that ""Troll 2"" will live up to the expectations set by the critical success of the first movie. In ""Troll"", a group consisting of Nora Tidemann (Ine Marie Wilmann), Andreas Isaksen (Kim S. Falck-Jørgensen) and Major Kristoffer ""Kris"" Holm (Mads Sjøgård Pettersen) had to stop an ancient giant troll from wreaking havoc after it was awakened in a Norwegian mountain. Now, they have to stop yet another troll from destroying Norway, and this time, they have the help of a second giant troll ready to fight the first.

Dear Abby: His Christian wife says she’ll divorce him if he doesn’t give up hosting his weekly live podcast,"DEAR ABBY: I’ve hosted a live podcast for years. It’s my creative outlet, my therapy. Recently, my wife gave me an ultimatum. I am not allowed to host the podcast anymore, or she’ll divorce me. She says it’s for “us,” not her. Her reason is mostly because I preach atheism as well as discuss many other topics. She’s a Christian. I was a Christian when we met and married, but I am no longer. I want to respect her faith, but I feel this is too much for her to ask. My show is a piece of what I want to share and document with the world. It’s only a few hours’ commitment a week, and I don’t do much else as far as recreation or hobbies. I am employed and responsible, and I fulfill all my duties as a husband. I’m terrified of losing either the show or my marriage. Is this a fair thing for my wife to demand? I have chosen to stop hosting the show for now, and I’m unhappy. I’d like my wife’s blessing so I can continue. Is there anything you would recommend? -- HOST IN EXILE DEAR HOST: I don’t know how far away in exile you are, but if you live within the borders of the United States, there is a certain amount of freedom of speech here. Living according to your wife’s dictate leaves you frustrated and unhappy. You have the right to express yourself, and you have an audience who appreciates it.

"Asking Eric: Family, friends don’t seem to appreciate time I put into tedious Christmas cookie tradition","Dear Eric: My late mother made a special Christmas cookie that required tedious decorating, considering each person’s personal preference for toppings, and giving them as gifts to family and friends. They always had a place of honor on our family Christmas table. When she was no longer able, she gave me the cookie cutter, and my daughters and I took over the family tradition. It takes the three of us several days to make, bake, decorate, package and mail cookies to family members around the country. We enjoy doing it and feel like we’re continuing the fun and festive tradition. However, in recent years, not all of the recipients acknowledge receipt. At some point in their lives, they have all helped Grandma decorate, so they know the time involved. Because of past delivery issues, I track the boxes and inquire if I haven’t heard from them in a couple of days. Last year, one response was “yes we got them.” This feels unappreciative! In the past most would text a picture of their children with the cookies, which we really enjoyed. We rarely see any of them anymore, as they are busy raising their families and don’t live nearby. This seems like a way for us to continue somewhat of a connection. Now my “cookie-making crew” is divided on whether we should continue sending them. Stop altogether? Just send to the ones who acknowledge? Continue sending to all in the spirit of Christmas? We would appreciate your unbiased take. – Baked in Tradition Dear Tradition: This feels like a great time to re-evaluate what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. Traditions can become rote on all sides, especially in families, so it can be useful to ask yourself if the activity, as it’s currently being performed, matches your goals for it. Maybe the joy is in carrying on your mother’s tradition. In that case, you might focus mostly on the time you get to spend with your daughters and the gift that your mother passed down to you. However, I suspect that, even if this is the primary motivation, the time spent making and shipping must be beginning to wear on you. I would take that as a sign from your body and the rhythms of your life that this might be a moment to adjust the tradition. It also seems like the tradition isn’t connecting you to relatives in the way that it used to. This isn’t the tradition’s fault, per se, but if what you want is a connection with far-flung relatives, you might have to try something new. It could be as simple as asking for a call, card or updated photo. Don’t be afraid to ask for what you need. Perhaps this year you can try a downsized version of the tradition on for size. See what it feels like to only send cookies to those who still acknowledge them. Think of it less as punishing those who’ve dropped off, but rather as nurturing the bonds that this tradition still serves. Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O.

"Avoiding Jail, Bosnian Serb War Criminal Joins Russia’s Ukraine Invasion","In May this year, Novak Stjepanovic posted on Facebook a photo of himself in a forest, a rifle on his shoulder, in military uniform bearing the words ‘Armed Forces of Russia’. “Destined by God to fight for justice all my life,” he wrote. Roughly a dozen photos and posts, by 59-year-old Stjepanovic and others, place him in Russian-occupied Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, between April and June, despite a court in Belgrade having convicted Stjepanovic in December last year of war crimes against civilians near the Bosnian town of Bratunac in 1992, crimes that included complicity in murder, torture, rape, inhumane treatment and theft. In June, the month after Stjepanovic posted his ‘fight for justice’ photo, the verdict was confirmed, and he was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Stjepanovic’s precise whereabouts are not known, but it is highly likely he is still in Ukraine, fighting with Russian forces that invaded the country in early 2022. The Higher Court in Belgrade confirmed that, during the trial, Stjepanovic was not prohibited from leaving Serbia. He was present when the verdict was read out in December, but Jovana Kolaric, who followed the trial as a researcher at the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Centre, said individuals sentenced to jail in Serbia are not usually put behind bars immediately. “The problem is that all of them are defending themselves while at liberty; detention measures are very rarely ordered,” Kolaric told BIRN. “They are mostly reserved for persons who are not citizens of Serbia.” Stjepanovic holds both Serbian and Bosnian citizenship. Edina Karic, one of three women held captive by Stjepanovic and other Bosnian Serb soldiers early in the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, said she had “lost all hope”. During the trial, Karic testified that she witnessed Stjepanovic rape a 19-year-old woman. “It’s a disaster,” she said of Stjepanovic’s ability to evade justice. “I don’t believe in the judicial system at all.” Neither Stjepanovic nor his Belgrade-based lawyer responded to repeated requests for comment. Novak Stjepanovic (right) with another soldier and a vehicle with the licence plates of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, an unrecognised Serb-run statelet within Croatia during the 1991-95 war. Stjepanovic’s caption reads: “Back in the day we were young and healthy, but time takes its toll.” Photo: Novak Stjepanovic/Facebook. Stjepanovic was first indicted for war crimes by a court in Bosnia in 2009, two years after Bosnian authorities issued a warrant for his arrest. The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina charged him with the capture, abuse and murder of civilians in Bratunac. It was only nine years later, however, that Bosnia managed to serve him with a new indictment, this time for sexual violence, while he was living in the Serbian town of Ljubovija, just over the border from Bratunac. The two indictments were then merged and the case transferred to Serbia; Stjepanovic’s trial began in January 2021 at the Higher Court in Belgrade. In December 2024, in a first instance ruling, Stjepanovic was found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in prison. The court found that, as a member of the Bosnian Serb army, Stjepanovic participated in capturing 14 Bosniak civilians in the village of Borkovac, near Bratunac, in May 1992, during a wave of brutal ethnic cleansing of non-Serbs in eastern Bosnia. The civilians were assaulted, robbed and forced to a nearby stream, where eight were killed. The court also found that Stjepanovic raped a 19-year-old Bosniak woman early the following month. The Belgrade Court of Appeal confirmed the verdict in June this year but increased his sentence to 13 years. Stjepanovic, however, was long gone. The last record of him appearing in court was on December 24 last year, when the first instance verdict was pronounced. In a meantime, prosecutors in Bosnia opened a new investigation into Stjepanovic concerning the murder of six civilians in Bratunac during the war. The case was sent to Serbia, but prosecutors in Belgrade sent it back, saying certain documents were missing. “After reviewing the files in the case, it was sent yet again to the Serbian judiciary on October 16, 2025, with the note that the allegedly missing documentation was already contained in the case file that had previously been handed over,” the Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina told BIRN. Stjepanovic first posted about travelling to Ukraine in early April, when he uploaded to Facebook a selfie in front of a statue of Vladimir Lenin near the Donbas Palace Hotel in Donetsk. During April and May, he published 10 photos from Ukraine; one showed his military identification tags, commonly known as ‘dog tags’, engraved with a number and ‘ВС Россия’ – Armed Forces of Russia. “I’m playing war a little bit in Russia,” he wrote in May in response to a question below a photo of him with an apparent wound to his right arm. In May, a Bosnian Serb association of war veterans from Bijeljina, eastern Bosnia, published a photo of Stjepanovic during what it said was fighting around the village of Pokrovske, Donetsk region. The village was mentioned the same month by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said the situation there was very difficult; Reuters news agency reported that elderly and sick residents were being evacuated. The association told BIRN that the photo was taken from another Facebook page but did not name the profile. Both Serbia and Stjepanovic’s native Bosnia revised their criminal codes in 2014 to prohibit participation in foreign conflicts, punishable by up to 10 years in prison in Serbia and eight years in Bosnia. Nevertheless, media have regularly reported on mercenaries from the Balkans enlisting with Russian forces ever since Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and fomenting of rebellion in the eastern Ukrainian Donbas region, which Donetsk is part of. Last year, the Ukrainian State Prosecutor’s Office requested information from Bosnia regarding 12 Bosnian citizens suspected of war crimes in Ukraine.

“I am still looking to get better every day...”: Virat Kohli on mindset,"Advertisement Ranchi: Vintage Virat Kohli once again underlined his immense value to India’s ODI setup, smashing a scintillating century to guide the hosts to a 17-run win over South Africa in the opening match of the series in Ranchi. Amid constant chatter surrounding his ODI future in the lead-up to the 2027 World Cup, Kohli delivered a statement performance. The 37-year-old brought up his 52nd ODI hundred, extending his record for the most centuries in a single format. His superb 135 off 120 balls, punctuated by 11 fours and seven sixes, showcased the full range of his class, control and experience. Reflecting on his mindset and approach, Kohli said his game continues to evolve with maturity on Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) official X handle. “For me, the core word is awareness, being aware of situations, being aware of your own feelings and thoughts when you succeed and when you fail, so that you try to be in the most central spot,” Kohli explained. “I have put in considerable amount of work over the years, so I would say that yes, I am in that place now. I can say that I am still looking to get better every day of my life, that’s where I am,” he added. In the match, the Proteas put India into bat first. While Yashasvi Jaiswal was removed after a promising start for a 16-ball 18, Rohit (57 in 51 balls, with five fours and three sixes) and Virat enthralled the Ranchi crowd with a 136-run second-wicket stand. India lost their way in the middle, with Rohit, Ruturaj Gaikwad (8) and Washington Sundar (13) dismissed in quick succession and India at 200/4 but a partnership of 76 runs between KL (60 in 56 balls, with two fours and a six) and Virat and later a 65-run stand for KL with Jadeja (32 in 20 balls, with two fours and a six) took India to 349/8 in 50 overs. Advertisement During the run-chase, South Africa lost three quick wickets to Indian pacers and stared at a defeat at 11/3. A 66-run stand between Tony de Zorzi (39 in 37 balls, with seven fours) and Matthew Breetzke brought some stability. Dewald Brevis also played a fine cameo of 37 in 28 balls, with two fours and three sixes, but half their side was gone at 130 runs. From there, a 97-run stand between Breetzke (72 in 80 balls, with eight fours and a six) and Marco Jansen (80 in 39 balls, with seven fours and three sixes) threatened to take away the game from India, but a timely Kuldeep Yadav intervention removed both, reducing Proteas to 227/8. But Corbin Bosch (67 in 51 balls, with five fours and four sixes) kept the fight alive alongside the lower order, taking SA near the touching distance of a win, but they fell short by 17 runs. Harshit Rana (3/65) was also fine with the ball. With this win, India has taken a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series.

"PKU Pioneer Facilitates Steel Mill's Energy Efficiency Upgrade: 30,000Nm3/h PSA Oxygen Project Successfully Completed","Beijing, China–(Newsfile Corp. – December 1, 2025) – Half a year has passed since the upgraded PSA oxygen generation station of Zhuhai Yueyufeng Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Yueyufeng Steel”) was officially put into operation. The optimized PSA oxygen generation plant has continuously provided stable oxygen supply for blast furnace oxygen enrichment, significantly boosting the steel mill’s production efficiency. In June 2025, the energy efficiency improvement and renovation project of Yueyufeng Steel’s 30,000 Nm³/h (7,500×4 Nm³/h) PSA oxygen generation unit, undertaken by Beijing Peking University Pioneer Technology Corporation Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “PKU Pioneer”), was successfully completed. Through systematic technical optimization, the project successfully solved the problem of continuous performance degradation of the original unit. After the renovation, the unit’s performance has fully exceeded the design indicators, and the power consumption for pure oxygen production has been significantly reduced, bringing substantial economic benefits to the client. Following the project’s commissioning, Yueyufeng Steel specially expressed its gratitude to PKU Pioneer and highly recognized its technical strength and service quality. Project Background: Operational Challenges Spur Renovation Needs Yueyufeng Steel’s four sets of 7,500 Nm³/h (80% purity) PSA oxygen generation system, put into operation in 2018, were supplied by an oxygen generation manufacturer with insufficient experience. Within 5 years of operation, a series of problems emerged, including frequent damage to the airbags inside the adsorption tower, a more than 30% drop in oxygen output, and a 20%-30% increase in power consumption. However, the root causes of these faults remained unidentified. In January 2025, after multiple investigations, Yueyufeng Steel chose to cooperate with PKU Pioneer and took the lead in launching the renovation of Units 3 and 4. During the project implementation, technical experts from PKU Pioneer conducted in-depth on-site investigations and customized a phased renovation plan for the client. The renovation of the two units was completed within two months, and both units were successfully commissioned on the first attempt. Their performance indicators not only far exceeded the client’s requirements but also surpassed the original design level of the units. PKU Pioneer’s technical team conducting on-site training and guidance Due to the remarkable results of the two units’ renovation, in April 2025, the two parties further signed a contract for the renovation of Units 1 and 2. To accelerate the renovation progress, PKU Pioneer’s technical team stayed on-site for equipment commissioning and ensured performance compliance through real-time data monitoring. Finally, in June 2025, the full-system upgrade of the PSA oxygen generation station was realized, providing stable oxygen supply for blast furnace oxygen enrichment and meeting the client’s production needs.

By conducting in-depth analysis of the operation data and process design of the original oxygen generation system, PKU Pioneer’s technical team identified that the core problems stemmed from multiple technical defects. The superposition of various influencing factors led to the continuous decline of oxygen production indicators, increased energy consumption, and rising costs. Firstly, the adsorption tower structure required modification. The original radial adsorption tower of the oxygen generation unit had design flaws in its sealing device. The renovation addressed the molecular sieve leakage issue inside the adsorption tower. For pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation units, ensuring the long-term stability of adsorbents is the process foundation for achieving a service life of over 10 years. Secondly, the performance indicators of adsorbents affect the overall performance of the unit. The adsorbents in the old unit exhibited varying degrees of pulverization and high wear rates. The renovation project adopted the high-efficiency lithium-based adsorbent PU-8, whose nitrogen-oxygen separation coefficient and strength are significantly higher than those of ordinary adsorbents. Combined with unique gas flow distribution technology, this extended the service life of the adsorbents and reduced bed resistance, thereby increasing oxygen output per unit time. After the renovation, the actual output of the oxygen generation unit increased by more than 10%, and the power consumption reduction exceeded the expected target by 20%. Thirdly, key supporting equipment impacts the operational reliability of the unit. The valves of the old unit had problems such as incorrect selection, material defects, and component wear and deformation. In PSA oxygen generation working conditions, valves switch at a high frequency of once every 30 seconds on average, requiring significant improvements in durability and supporting upgrades. During the renovation, PKU Pioneer fully modified and replaced the problematic valves, equipping them with special valves suitable for PSA working conditions. Finally, the unreasonable design of the intelligent control system affected performance optimization. The development of a streamlined, efficient, fully functional, and applicable PLC control program is an important technical guarantee for ensuring the safe, stable, and long-term reliable operation of PSA oxygen generation units. Based on the unit parameters, PKU Pioneer developed and optimized the program control logic, enabling rapid adaptive adjustment of the unit and energy efficiency optimization, ensuring that the oxygen generation unit always operates at a stable level with low energy consumption. Project Insights: Technical Strength Builds Core Competitiveness The successful commissioning of Yueyufeng Steel’s four oxygen generation plants not only solved the oxygen supply problem for blast furnaces but also became another benchmark project of PKU Pioneer in the iron and steel industry. As a leading enterprise in pressure swing adsorption oxygen generation technology, PKU Pioneer is well aware of the decisive role of process details in unit performance: the optimized design of the adsorption tower structure, the precise control of molecular sieve filling, and the working condition adaptability of valve selection – these key technical details directly affect the energy efficiency and service life of the unit. Relying on the scientific research advantages of Peking University, PKU Pioneer has continuously deepened basic research on pressure swing adsorption technology over the past 26 years. It has fully exerted its full-chain technical integration capabilities covering “design-manufacturing-operation and maintenance” and collaborated with leading enterprises in the iron and steel and chemical industries to conduct green gas technology research. The company is committed to building each engineering project into an industry model and promoting the high-quality development of the pressure swing adsorption industry.

People urged to carry out 10-minute task of 'burping your home' 2 times a day,"Homes and interiors Leisure The weather may be getting colder, but Brits are being urged to open their windows regularly throughout winter for one key reason. Ensuring your home remains ventilated with fresh air circulating through it is important, particularly during winter when you may be tempted to keep them shut. Opening your windows more regularly will not only help fresh air circulate but can reduce the chances of mould, damp and mildew. Keeping your home ventilated in winter is key for preventing mould and damp (Image: Getty Images) Jack Baldwin is the director of Lancaster-based Baldwin Building Services. Among the company's services is inspecting properties for damp and advising householders on how to keep their homes free of mould. Jack said: ""Opening windows a couple of times a day is definitely a great way of keeping air circulating and keeping black mould at bay. ""It can be a particular problem at this time of year when people are more likely to dry clothes indoors, which can increase humidity and lead to the build-up of mould. ""Opening windows for a short time to allow moisture to escape and let some fresh air in is the first thing we recommend to our customers."" Yvonne Keal, senior product manager at home retail company Hillarys, concurred, adding: ""Opening your windows twice a day is a great way to let fresh air circulate and reduce humidity, which helps prevent mould and damp. ""Even if it’s damp outside, the key is short, controlled ventilation, just 5 to 10 minutes at a time. This allows stale, moisture-heavy air to escape without introducing excess dampness indoors."" Helen O’Connor, Product and Trends Manager at 24/7 Blinds, referred to the process as 'burping your home'. ""This is the process of opening the windows in your home for short bursts, usually for around 10 minutes at a time,"" she said. ""Burping your home encourages the circulation of fresh air and prevents condensation, which in turn prevents the growth of mould. ""In addition to burping your room to prevent mould, it is also good for your well-being, helping to boost your mood and improve stress levels. ""Mould thrives in areas with high moisture and humidity paired with low air circulation – and will grow quickly in places where water is present or air is stagnant."" There are many ways to keep mould out of your home (Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto) As well as regularly opening your windows, there are other ways experts say can help prevent mould in your home. James Kane, of ventilation specialists EnviroVent, advised against drying clothes indoors. He said: ""Even with open windows, it is worth noting that drying clothes indoors releases litres of moisture into the air. If you can’t dry outside, see if you can use your bathroom as a drying room. ""With the heater on and a humidity-controlled extractor fan on, clothes will dry, and moisture can be exhausted from the property. Avoid drying clothes in bedrooms or living rooms without airflow."" Sam Carter, radiator expert at Appliances Direct, explained the importance of choosing the right radiator to keep the temperature in your home at the right levels. He recommends keeping your house between 18C and 21C to keep damp and mould at bay. Sam said: ""If your home is well-insulated, opt for aluminium radiators. They heat up quickly and cool down slowly, meaning your home will stay warm for longer without needing constant heat. ""You simply don't need a continuous output, saving you money in the long run. ""If your home is poorly insulated, however, go for steel radiators. They provide a steady, consistent heat output and retain warmth for longer. Recommended reading: He added: ""Pairing them with a dehumidifier can make a huge difference, too. I'd always recommend that you run a good-quality dehumidifier in the winter months, especially when drying laundry. ""A good quality dehumidifier will help you dry clothes more quickly and also keep humidity down to prevent condensation. ""Mould starts to develop above 65% humidity, so aim for 50-55% in your home, which sounds complicated to figure out but most dehumidifier units will do this for you automatically.""",2025-12-01 08:03:58,Lancashire Telegraph,positive,0.5513,45,Her_She_Clothes," Keeping your home ventilated in winter is key for preventing mould and damp .

Las Vegas Raiders 2026 Kicker Options,"The Las Vegas Raiders extended P AJ Cole this off-season and chose to delay their extension for kicker Daniel Carlson who was coming off a rather down season where he converted 34 of 40 field goals good for 85% with 23/25 on PATs. This season, Carlson is just 15/19 (78.9%) not counting a missed FG vs the Browns while also being 12/13 on PATs. Carlson is having a down season in terms of his PAT and Field Goal rate while also being just 3/6 on 50+ yard conversions. Carlson has been a sold kicker for the Raiders since his 2018 season including back to back All Pro honors in 2021 and 2022. At a career 87% on field goals and Carlson struggling to convert from 50+ yards the look for another kicker could be in the cards this offseason for Las Vegas. Along with Carlson, the other notable kickers to hit free agency this off-season include Jets Nick Folk, Cardinals Chad Ryland, Riley Patterson, Eddy Pinerio. Folk has been a solid veteran for his career and at 41 years old would be a good stop gap option with his career 85% FG rate and 97% on PAT including 100% this season on field goals along with being 6/6 on 50+ yard attempts. Ryland a former standout at Eastern Michigan has posted a career 78.9% FG rate and 97% on PAT. After an initial struggle early on going 64% as a rookie he’s converted 85% this season including 2/4 from 50+ though likely wouldn’t be an upgrade off Carlson. Dolphins kicker Riley Patterson is just 86% on his career for field goals but is converting 89.5% this season though his main struggle has been from 50+ where he’s 4/11 on his career. Pinerio initially started his career with the Raiders as the former Florida standout signed with the Raiders as a UDFA in 2018. Pinerio is 89.9% on his career for field goals including 22/22 in 2025 and he’s 90.5% on PAT which has been his largest struggle. Pinerio has a strong leg including a career 59 yard field goal and is 17/20 on 50+ yard attempts. Being sub 95% on PAT is a concern, but Pinerio’s strong leg and accuracy as a field goal kicker could net him a good contract at just 31 years old and he’d likely be an upgrade for the Raiders. This draft class doesn’t hold any notable kickers though there’s four top options going into the season with BYU’s Will Ferrin, Hawaii’s Kansei Matsuzawa, UCon’s Chris Freman, and Florida’s Trey Smack. Smack is the most likely to see his name called during the draft going 82% on FG (51/62) in his career and 100% on PAT (96/96) he holds a strong leg with the ability to complete TB and good yardage on kickoff’s as well. Ferrin has converted 85% of his FG (55/65) and 99% of his PAT (114/115) though the concern has come from his ability to consistently hit from 50+ where he’s converted just a career long of 52 yards. Matsuzawa has been a breakout player this season going 100% on FG (23/23) and 100% on PAT (34/34) though his career long of 52 yards is a concern as well. Freeman has struggled previously in his career going just 30/40 in 2023 and 2025 but he converted 78/79 of his PAT’s during that span. This season he’s taken a stride going 23/25 on FG and 51/51 on PAT including a 55 yarder and 6/6 on 50+ attempts. Freeman may not hear his name called but he’s worth a shot as a UDFA and has a good chance to stick in the NFL. Iowa’s Will Stevens and Michigan’s Dom Zvada have been headline names but both have struggled this off-season but would be worth looks as UDFA’s due to their leg strength. The NFL has seen Ryan Bates and Brandon Aubrey come over from the UFL and they are seemingly the top 2 kickers currently in the NFL. Teams will look to follow that trend with Rodrigo Blankenship as the top option where he’s converted 21/22 of FG last season with a long of 56 yards which lead the UFL. The former NFL kicker went a career 57/56 on FG and 54/58 on PAT, so the history is there for his success to translate. The CFL has a different kicking situation than the NFL but has seen some players translate to the NFL with the current notables being Jose Maltos (58/65, 58 long), Lirim Harjullahu (57/64, 56 long), and Sergio Castillo (48/56, 63 long). Consistency is the toughest to project with CFL to NFL kickers but with the advanced leg strength there’s a chance for some to translate. The Raiders signed veteran kicker Greg Joseph to the practice squad during this season amid the struggles from Carlson. Joseph is a career 82.3% field goal kicker and 90.8 on PATs so the numbers aren’t in his best interest while also being just 17/30 on 50+ yard field goal attempts. Joseph saw majority of his success early in his career in 2018-2019 where he converted 50/58 on field goals and 70/78 on PAT for an 86% and 90% conversion rates. Joseph ideally isn’t a teams starting kicker and has been used recently in spot start situations for injuries or struggling kickers to end the season. The Raiders can upgrade over Daniel Carlson this off-season but Greg Joseph likely wouldn’t do that.",2025-12-01 20:08:00,Yahoo!

How Colorado Buffaloes Can Still Boost Troubling Recruiting Class,"The Colorado Buffaloes' recruiting class of 2026 holds just 10 commits, but there is still time left to add key players. The early signing period for college football takes place from Dec. 3-5. While time is winding down, Colorado coach Deion Sanders and the Buffaloes can still add to their class, pulling off big flips. Last year, Sanders and the Buffaloes flipped key recruits in the fall, and the program can do it again. According to Rivals’ Sam Spiegelman, the Buffaloes have a chance to flip three key players that would boost the team’s recruiting class. The Colorado Buffaloes recruiting class of 2026 ranks No. 76 in the nation and almost last - No. 15 - in the Big 12, per On3. With just 10 commits, the Buffaloes will be a team to watch to pull off some big flips late in the game. The Colorado Buffaloes have not stopped targeting four-star wide receiver recruit Cederian Morgan. Morgan committed to the Alabama Crimson Tide over Colorado in July, which was a tough blow for the Buffaloes, but there is still a chance the program can flip the wide receiver. Per the Rivals Industry Ranking, Morgan is the No. 44 recruit in the nation, the No. 5 wide receiver, and the No. 3 player from Alabama. Morgan visited Colorado in September, and the Buffaloes are putting up a fight against Alabama to land the wide receiver. “They got a great shot,” Morgan told Rivals’ Steve Wiltfong when he visited in May. “Just getting in there knowing I can play early and build my brand and being under Coach Prime and the other coaches on the staff … That could be an easy path for me to get to the NFL.” Despite Morgan’s commitment to Alabama, the Buffaloes were heavily in the race for his recruitment in July and are still a team to watch. Morgan has a good chance of playing early in his true freshman season with Colorado, which will help him develop and pursue a career in the NFL. With the team continuing to keep up the communication and make the wide receiver feel like a priority, the Buffaloes can pull off a major flip. Morgan is not the only wide receiver that the Buffaloes are looking to flip. Four-star wide receiver Devin Carter committed to the Florida State Seminoles in June, but visited Colorado during the final weekend of the season.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER HERE. Carter has already flipped his commitment once, from Auburn to Florida State, and could do so again. Despite reaffirming he was committed to Florida State in November, the wide receiver recruit still took a visit to Colorado, potentially keeping the door open. Carter is a speedy player and a strong route runner who can create space between himself and the defender. He has a high ceiling, and with his ability to break away from the defender, Carter would be a valuable target for quarterback Julian Lewis to throw to with the Buffaloes. Adding another wide receiver would be a major boost to Colorado’s recruiting class. Of the 10 commits, only one is a wide receiver, three-star Christian Ward. With a young quarterback in Lewis set to take over the team, if Colorado can flip either Morgan or Carter, it would elevate the program next season. Colorado has recruited defensive players at a high level, looking to add one more. Three-star defensive line recruit Tico Crittendon decommitted from the Florida State Seminoles in November and has yet to pick a new program. After decommitting from Florida State, Crittendon listed the Colorado Buffaloes as one of the schools sticking out to him. South Carolina and Georgia Tech are two other programs pursuing the lineman, but per Rivals, Crittendon was in Boulder for a visit with the Buffaloes. Colorado’s defense struggled throughout the season, totaling just 13 sacks, with opponents running the ball at a high level. The Buffaloes have recruited just one player across the defensive line, four-star edge Domata Peko Jr., and landing Crittendon would be a major boost to the team. As Colorado looks to bolster the defense, Crittendon would be an ideal target for the Buffaloes. He is a big athlete at 6-4, 300 pounds, and can develop into an elite defensive lineman. feed Angela Miele is a beat reporter covering the USC Trojans, Colorado Buffaloes, and Oregon Ducks for On SI.

Plea in Indore court seeks FIR against IAS Santosh Verma over controversial remarks,"A petition has been filed at a court in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore against IAS officer Santosh Kumar Verma, days after his remarks related to reservation and the Brahmin community created a stir in the State and outside. Shailendra Dwivedi, an Indore-based lawyer, filed a plea before the Judicial Magistrate First Class seeking directions for the police to register an FIR against Mr. Verma while alleging that his statement was “vulgar, obscene and cheap”. At a regional event of the M.P. Anusuchit Jati-Janjati Adhikari Evam Karmachari Sangh (AJJAKS) on November 23 in Bhopal, Mr. Verma had said, “Reservation should continue until a Brahmin gives away his daughter to my son, or (she) has a relationship with him, if it’s only about the economic aspect.” He had been appointed the new State president of the body at the event. Mr. Verma later apologised for his remarks and clarified that by “giving away” he meant kanyadaan (Hindu wedding ritual of giving away a daughter in marriage) and was referring to the ‘roti-beti’ culture between different castes, which promotes inter-caste marriages. However, his remarks led to various protests from Brahmin outfits and leaders who alleged that they were derogatory towards women as they demanded an FIR and disciplinary action against the bureaucrat. The State Government also issued a show-cause notice to Mr. Verma, saying that his statement prima facie amounted to “harming social harmony and creating animosity in the society” and fell under the category of “indiscipline and serious misconduct”. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Dwivedi said, “I come from the Brahmin community and am deeply hurt by Santosh Verma’s offensive statements about my community. I request the court to order the police to register a case against him under the relevant legal provisions and submit an investigation report.” The court has set December 4 for hearing the plea, he said.",2025-12-01 20:08:00,The Hindu,neutral,0.5251,19,Singh_Yadav_Bjp," A petition has been filed against Santosh Kumar Verma in Indore, Madhya Pradesh .

"Doctor says Trump had preventative screening MRI on heart, abdomen with 'perfectly normal' results","President Donald Trump speaks with reporters while in flight on Air Force One from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., to Joint Base Andrews, Sunday, Nov. 30, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump’ s doctor says the president had MRI imaging on his heart and abdomen in October as part of a preventative screening for men his age, according to a memo from the physician released by the White House on Monday. Sean Barbabella said in a statement that Trump’s physical exam included “advanced imaging” that is “standard for an executive physical” in Trump’s age group. Barbabella concluded that the cardiovascular and abdominal imaging was “perfectly normal.” “The purpose of this imaging is preventative: to identify issues early, confirm overall health, and ensure he maintains long-term vitality and function,” the doctor wrote. The White House released Barbabella’s memo after Trump on Sunday said he would release the results of the scan. He and the White House have said the scan was “part of his routine physical examination” but had declined until Monday to detail why Trump had an MRI during his physical in October at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center or on what part of his body. “I think that’s quite a bit of detail,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday when announcing the memo’s release. The Republican president said Sunday during an exchange with reporters as he traveled back to Washington from Florida that the results of the MRI were “perfect.” Javascript is required for you to be able to read premium content.

Speaking to reporters at a press briefing at the White House, Leavitt said men of Trump’s age benefited from such screenings. “President Trump’s cardiovascular imaging was perfectly normal, no evidence of arterial narrowing, impairing blood flow or abnormalities in the heart or major vessels,” Leavitt said of the 79-year-old president. “The heart chambers are normal in size. The vessel walls appear smooth and healthy, and there are no signs of inflammation or clotting. Overall, his cardiovascular system shows excellent health. His abdominal imaging is also perfectly normal,” Leavitt said. Trump underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan during a recent medical evaluation, but did not disclose the purpose of the procedure, which is not typical for standard check-ups. The lack of details raised questions about whether full information regarding the president’s health is being released in a timely fashion by the White House. Trump is sensitive about his age and well-being. He personally attacked a female New York Times reporter on social media last week over a story she co-wrote examining the ways that Trump’s age may be affecting his energy levels.",2025-12-01 20:08:00,Cyprus Mail,positive,0.8407,11,Against_Donald_Trump," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said a recent MRI conducted on President Donald Trump was preventative in nature and revealed that he was in good cardiovascular health .

Eagles vs Chargers Predictions - Early Picks & Odds for Monday Night Football Week 14,"The Philadelphia Eagles cross the country for a non-conference Monday Night Football matchup with the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 14. All eyes are on the left hand of L.A. quarterback Justin Herbert, who suffered a fracture to his non-throwing hand in Week 13. Despite the injury, the Bolts expect to have their star gunslinger in action. I break down my early Eagles vs. Chargers predictions and NFL picks for Monday, December 8. Here are our early thoughts on the spread and total for this week’s game. We will have a full game preview (with a best bet and SGP) later in the week. -105 at bet365 The Philadelphia Eagles bring a two-game losing skid with them to La-La Land in Week 14. Philadelphia’s defense has been a no-show in losses to Dallas and Chicago, but it can take advantage of the Los Angeles Chargers porous pass protection. The Chargers' offensive line has been burdened by injuries all season, but even with that group getting healthy, they’ve still let Justin Herbert feel the heat far too much. He’s felt the highest rate of pressure among qualified QBs and will have to modify his snap routine and formation with that busted hand. The Chargers have won five of their last seven games overall, but those victories have come against some bottom-tier teams and sub-par QBs, like Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, Tennessee, and Minnesota. Given the trajectory of the vig, we might see this spread slip below a field goal. From there, Eagles bettors will want to get down quick, as I suspect that buyback will bring it back to Philly -3. -105 at bet365 This total opened at 42.5 and powered through the key O/U of 41 points with Herbert’s hand issues fueling that move. The Eagles’ ineptitude on offense is also convincing early money to take the Under. Philadelphia has looked lost since the second half of Week 12’s matchup with Dallas, and I don’t think a run-in with one of the top defenses in the league will help fix it. Los Angeles is very stingy, especially through the air, and the Eagles may have to ground-and-pound their way down the field. The Bolts’ zone-heavy schemes don’t let much behind them, and they’ve allowed the fewest explosive passing plays in the league. As mentioned, life could be just as tough for Herbert and the Chargers' offense. Vic Fangio has had extra time to scheme for L.A. after playing last Friday and needs to create a lot of pressure up front to make up for a shaky secondary. Eagles vs. Chargers spread: Chargers +3 Eagles vs. Chargers moneyline: Eagles -160, Chargers +135 Eagles vs. Chargers Over/Under: 40.5 Eagles vs. Chargers matchup Date: Monday, December 8, 2025, 8:15 p.m. ET City: Los Angeles, CA Venue: SoFi Stadium TV: ESPN Odds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.Not intended for use in MA.Affiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

The darkest fabric ever made is now a dress,"Get the Popular Science daily newsletter💡 Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There is black, and then there is ultrablack. The shade defined as a black that reflects less than 0.5 percent of the light that hits it, is used on everything from telescopes to cameras. This uniquely dark color is not easy to produce and may appear less black when it is viewed at an angle. To find a better way to reproduce this cool color, a team at Cornell University looked to nature. Specifically, a bird called the magnificent riflebird. The result is the darkest known fabric ever created and it is detailed in a study recently published in the journal Nature Communications. The magnificent riflebird is a large songbird and member of the bird-of-paradise family found in New Guinea and Australia. Male riflebirds are almost completely black, with a green and blue metallic sheen on their belly, throat, and crown feathers. With the help of Mary M. Ferraro and Vanya Rohwer from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the team studied the riflebird’s black feathers. Their plumage comes from melanin pigment paired with tightly bunched filaments called barbules that deflect light inward. This combination of pigment barbules means that the feathers absorb nearly all the light that hits it, making the bird look extraordinarily black. However, the feathers are only ultra-back when it is viewed straight on. When looked at from an angle, the plumage appears shiny. Researchers in the university’s Responsive Apparel Design (RAD) Lab dyed a white merino wool knit fabric with polydopamine, a compound that can be used as a dark dye. “Polydopamine is a synthetic melanin, and melanin is what these creatures have,” Dr. Larissa Shepherd, a study co-author and materials scientist, said in a statement. “And the riflebird has these really interesting hierarchical structures, the barbules, along with the melanin. So we wanted to combine those aspects in a textile.” Simply coating the surface of the wool with polydopamine was not enough to create an ultrablack fabric. The polydopamine needed to completely penetrate the fibers of the fabric, so that every square inch became black. To do this, they etched the fabric in a plasma chamber to create spiky nanoscale growths called nanofibrils. “The light basically bounces back and forth between the fibrils, instead of reflecting back out – that’s what creates the ultrablack effect,” added study co-author and doctoral student Hansadi Jayamaha. The nanofibrils ultimately were a way to mimic how the riflebird’s ultrablack feathers trap light and absorb most of the light that hits them. By using this combination of polydopamine dye and the nanofibrils, the team created the darkest known fabric. In their new study, the team reports that the fabric has an average total reflectance of 0.13 percent, making it the darkest known fabric ever reported. It also remained ultrablack across a 120-degree angular span, so appears the same at up to a 60-degree angle either side or straight on. “From a design perspective, I think it’s exciting because a lot of the ultrablack that exists isn’t really as wearable as ours,” Shepherd added “And it stays ultrablack even from wider angles.” [ Related: Five people view a never-before-seen color called ‘olo’. ] The fabric has several applications in both fashion design and the tech world. According to study co-author and doctoral student Kyuin Park, their ultrablack fabric could help solar panels convert and use absorbed light into thermal energy. “We could actually use the ultrablack fabric for thermo-regulating camouflage,” he said. Additionally, fashion design major and recent graduate Zoe Alvarez created a black strapless dress inspired by the riflebird last fall. The ultrablack material was the centerpiece, with a splash of iridescent blue. Images of this dress were used to confirm ultrablack’s true “blackness.” When the image’s contrast, hue, vibrance, or brightness were all adjusted, the other colors changed, but the ultrablack remained the same. The researchers have applied for patent protection and hope to create a company that dyes fabrics with their process. It can be used on natural materials, including cotton, wool, and even silk.

Virginia Formichi,"Birth: 1925 Death: 2025 Virginia J. Formichi, a lifelong San Franciscan, dedicated humanitarian, and woman of deep Catholic faith, passed away on July 23, 2025, at the age of 99. Born on November 16, 1925, at St. Francis Hospital to John and Lena (Toboni) Formichi, Virginia lived a life that touched people across the globe while always remaining rooted in her beloved City by the Bay. Virginia’s education shaped her calling to serve. She graduated from St. Vincent de Paul Grammar School in 1939 and St. Brigid High School in 1942, later earning a B.A. in Sociology from Dominican College of San Rafael (1962) and a Master’s in Social Work from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. (1964). She pursued postgraduate studies in Social Welfare at UC Berkeley and, in 1968, earned her Juris Doctor from the University of San Francisco as the only woman in her graduating class. In 1955, Virginia joined Catholic Relief Services, embarking on a career in international humanitarian service that spanned more than five decades. Her work took her far beyond San Francisco to Italy, Malta, Lebanon, and throughout Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and India. She directed adoption programs for war orphans, oversaw refugee resettlement, and helped build programs in child welfare, education, and socio-economic development. She carried out this mission with devotion to the Catholic Church and with a conviction that service to the most vulnerable was a calling of both faith and humanity. Her impact was recognized worldwide. She received a Commendation from the Minister of Social Welfare of Malta (1962), the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice Medal from Pope Paul VI (1968), the Order of Merit of the Government of Italy (1972), and was invested into the Order of the Holy Sepulcher of Jerusalem (1987). Closer to home, Virginia gave her time and talents generously. She served as President of the Dominican University Alumni Association, as a member of the University’s Board of Trustees, and as President of the Dominican Scholarship Fund Board. A member of San Francisco’s Metropolitan Club since 1952, she contributed to many committees and delighted in the friendships she found there. She especially enjoyed playing bridge, a pastime that brought her both challenge and joy. Virginia was preceded in death by her brother Robert and his wife Peggy. She is survived by her beloved nieces and nephews: Bob Formichi, Jerd Formichi, Bret Formichi, Lisa Formichi, David Formichi, Maria Formichi-King (husband Greg), and Nina Formichi. She was also cherished by her 11 grand-nieces and grand-nephews: Dominic King (wife Ashley) and their daughter Capri, Christopher King (wife Judy) Joseph King (wife Mikayla), Melena King-Anastassiou (husband Alex), Olivia King, Angelina King, Sophia King, David King, Lucia King, Isabella King, and Giorgio King. Virginia will be remembered as a trailblazer, a woman of faith, and a compassionate servant of others. She was engaging and witty to the very end, leaving behind laughter as well as love. Her legacy of service stretches from San Francisco to communities around the world. In accordance with her wishes, no services will be held. Memorial contributions may be made in her name to The Mother Mary Raymond Scholarship Fund or The Virginia Formichi Endowed Scholarship at Dominican University at 52 Acacia Avenue, San Rafael, CA 94901.

Newcastle United want Manchester City goalkeeper James Trafford in winter,"Newcastle United want to sign Manchester City goalkeeper James Trafford during the winter transfer window, according to the Daily Mail. Newcastle wanted the Englishman at the St James’ Park club during the summer transfer window, but City used a matching rights clause to beat them to his signing. However, the Magpies are expected to return for the 23-year-old next month after his struggles to play regular football. Trafford was told he would be first-choice after joining from Burnley, but Man City signed Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain on transfer deadline day, and the Italian has started every Premier League game since. Trafford now wants to leave for regular playing opportunities elsewhere, and Newcastle could be willing to hand him the chances he desires. He was hoping his move to Man City would help him claim the England starting berth from Everton’s Jordan Pickford, but he has played just thrice since the arrival of Donnarumma. Newcastle signed Aaron Ramsdale on loan from Southampton, and he could get a run of games after calls were made to drop Nick Pope following some mistakes. Trafford would not be guaranteed an immediate place in the Magpies’ starting XI given the quality and experience of Ramsdale and Pope. However, Toons manager Eddie Howe is a fan of the Man City star and could be willing to throw him into his line-up due to his style of play. Newcastle could do with quality additions during the winter transfer window as they look to finish strong across all competitions during the second half of the season. Another goalie should not be a priority given their other needs, and they must make smart decisions. Newcastle want AZ Alkmaar midfielder Kees Smit and would be open to selling Joe Willock to Crystal Palace if the Dutchman can be signed. They could do with one or two more attackers too with William Osula eyeing a move to Eintracht Frankfurt after reportedly reaching a verbal agreement to join them.",2025-12-02 08:05:00,Yahoo!

Grandkids identify victim of 50-year-old robbery after Clarkston High grad’s public confession,"Grandchildren of a man beaten and robbed 50 years ago will accept restitution from their beloved grandfather’s attacker. The robber made a confession in Sunday’s Lewiston Tribune in an effort to identify the victim in order to make amends. The Tribune’s Facebook page solved the mystery quickly. On July 31, 1975, Lester C. Ayers, then 73, was “beaten and robbed” behind the Albertson’s Food Center in downtown Lewiston. Police said Ayers was “hit in the forehead with a tree limb by two young men,” according to an old Tribune clipping provided by the family. The two men took $76. Ayers told police the men were 18- to 19-years-old, medium height, both blonde, and one was shirtless, the other barefoot. The robbery is Ayers family lore. “We all remember when Grandpa had the bandage on his head,” said Debbie Asplund, a real estate agent in Lewiston, who was 13 years old in 1975. “At the time I was very angry.” Kerry Houston, 67, of Otis, Ore., confessed to the attack after guarding the secret for decades. His confession aligns with the old Tribune report, down to the detail of recalling that the elderly man was loading expired green produce. However, Houston claimed to have been the lone robber. Houston could not be reached Monday to explain the discrepancy. Regardless, Asplund said Houston’s confession, and desire to make amends, made this a special Thanksgiving weekend for the family. Anger over the attack faded over time — mostly. “That’s great that he turned his life around, and I get it that he was only 17 years old,” Asplund said. “But Grandpa was 70-some-years old at the time and I was 13 years old and I had some hard feelings.” And, no, the family has no interest in Houston’s offer to let them smack him in the back of the head with a stick if they want to get even. Mostly, Asplund and her cousins want to share memories of a kind man, who along with his wife, Lucy, they feel blessed to have known. The “sweet man” the family knew lived a strikingly different life from the teen who attacked him. Houston used the stolen $76 to buy drugs and beer for a weekend campout on a Snake River beach. Ayers, on the other hand, was described as a hard-working father of 10 children and 31 grandkids. Lester and Lucy were married in 1921 in Billings, Mont., and they moved to Lewiston in 1925. Lucy eventually became a nurse, retiring from the hospital in 1963. Lester worked for Potlatch Forest Inc. on the legendary Clearwater River log drives. He died in 1988 at age 86. Lucy died at age 95 in 1996. Lester Ayers “was a fixture” at the Albertson’s store, Asplund said. In fact, the day of the attack it was the store manager who found Lester unconscious on the ground when he noticed his old truck parked too long behind the store. Lester fed spoiled lettuce and other expired food items to his hogs, horses, cows, geese and turkeys at his farm near Warner Avenue and 14th Street in the Lewiston Orchards. Over the Thanksgiving weekend, his grandchildren shared memories of him sitting at the kitchen table, playing cards, whistling cheerfully even as he smoked a cigarette. They enjoyed pitching the produce to eager horses and cows. They remember camping trips and big slabs of butter on pancakes in the mornings. They all remember how big his smile was and his hugs and kisses. Lester Ayers recovered from the attack and didn’t let it embitter him toward the world. “He was maybe a little more distrusting — maybe,” Asplund said. “But my grandpa never was an angry person.” Ferguson can be reached at dferguson@lmtribune.com.",2025-12-02 08:05:00,The Lewiston Tribune Online,neutral,0.4968,10,Beaverton_Houston_Niles," Lester C.

"ROSEN, THE FIRST FILING FIRM, Encourages Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action First Filed by the Firm - FCX","NEW YORK, Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX) between February 15, 2022 and September 24, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important January 12, 2026 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm. SO WHAT: If you purchased Freeport-McMoRan securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Freeport class action, go to or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than January 12, 2026. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Freeport-McMoRan did not adequately ensure safety at the Grasberg Block Cave mine in Indonesia; (2) the lack of proper safety precautions constituted a heightened risk that could foreseeably lead to the death of Freeport’s workers; (3) this constituted an undisclosed heightened risk of regulatory, litigation, and reputational risk; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Freeport-McMoRan’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Freeport class action, go to or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point.

BirchBioMed’s Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Treatment Receives Orphan Drug Designation,"FDA has granted orphan drug designation to FS2 (kynurenic acid) for the investigational treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. BirchBioMed, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, announced on Dec. 2, 2025 that FDA has granted the company’s FS2 (kynurenic acid) orphan drug designation (ODD) for the investigational treatment ofidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (1). Identified by the University of British Columbia as a potential candidate for clinical research, FS2 (kynurenic acid) is a topical treatment for scars and the systemic treatment of organ fibrosis. According to BirchBioMed, IPF is a serious, rare chronic lung disease that results in thickening and stiffening of lung tissues surrounding the alveoli in the lungs, potentially causing permanent scarring of the lungs and making breathing difficult. FS2 (kynurenic acid) demonstrated scar prevention during preclinical trials. It also showed a breakdown and reduction of existing scars externally and internally that were the result of injury, surgery, or disease (1). “A subsequent Phase II randomized double-blind clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of topical FS2 cream demonstrated superior, statistically significant efficacy on mature keloid scars as compared not only to the vehicle control but to a market leading scar cream,” the company stated in the press release (1). “FS2 is unique in its therapeutic category as it targets scarring on the molecular level.” FDA’s orphan drug designation promotes development of treatments for rare diseases that impact fewer than 200,000 people in the United States by granting companies market exclusivity for seven years post approval, exemption from user fees, tax credits for qualified clinical testing, and more (2). IPF impacts fewer than three million to five million people in the world, and it does not currently have a cure (1). ""Being granted orphan drug designation by [FDA] is a pivotal milestone in BirchBioMed's development of FS2 for the treatment of IPF, a debilitating and fatal disease that has no more than a 5-year life expectancy after diagnosis,"" Mark S. Miller, chairman and CEO of BirchBioMed, said in the press release (1). ""[FDA's] designation provides BirchBioMed with development and commercial capabilities to address this high, unmet medical need."" ""This ODD indicates the scientific value of FS2 in the investigational treatment of IPF and underscores the opportunity for IPF patients to participate in our clinical trials,” Carlos Camozzi,chief medical officer, BirchBioMed, stated in the release (1). “BirchBioMed is seeking regulatory approval to begin clinical trials on the systemic use of FS2 for the treatment of organ fibrosis, beginning with IPF early next year. As experts in the development of products for scarring and other fibrosis-related disorders, we are laser focused on FS2's potential to transform the lives of people suffering from this severe, chronic, deteriorating, irreversible, life-threatening lung disease."" Pharmaceutical Technology®’s November 2025 Drug Solutions Podcast gathered industry experts to discuss novel modalities for the treatment of rare diseases, including advancements in oncology (3). Listen to Sarah Hein, PhD, co-founder and CEO, March Biosciences; Joe Katakowski, PhD, director of research for the RTW Foundation; and Dan Williams, PhD, co-founder, executive director, and CEO, SynaptixBio, discuss the role of patients’ families in accelerating R&D for these rare conditions in the podcast at PharmTech.com.

Pennsylvania cop was offered a free sandwich as a reward to arrest Luigi Mangione,"Published Dec 2, 2025 at 3:08 p.m. ET Share Published Dec 2, 2025 at 3:08 p.m. ET Share Make your contribution now and help Gothamist thrive in 2025. Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations When an Altoona, Pennsylvania police officer texted his supervisor to say he was responding to a tip that the suspect in a nationwide manhunt was sitting in a local McDonald's, the supervisor was incredulous. “If you get the New York City shooter I’ll buy you a hoagie,” Officer Joseph Detwiler recalled his superior saying. Detwiler didn’t say if he ever got the free sandwich. But he did make the arrest. He testified Tuesday at multiday hearings in New York state court. Mangione’s defense attorneys say Altoona police did not read Mangione his Miranda rights or obtain a proper warrant before they started interrogating him and searched his backpack. The attorneys are moving to suppress evidence before trial. Mangione faces state and federal murder charges, and is accused of shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson outside a Midtown hotel last year. Detwiler testified that when he and his partner approached Mangione in the back of the fast food restaurant and asked him to pull down his mask, “I knew it was him immediately.” “I watch a lot of Fox News,” Detwiler told prosecutors. He’d said he'd seen photos of the murder suspect’s face shared by the NYPD “many, many times.” On Tuesday, people in the courtroom for the first time saw body camera footage from Mangione’s arrest last December. The video shows Detwiler and his partner entering the McDonald’s and locating Mangione in the back. Christmas carols play in the background as the two begin to question him. When they ask Mangione why he’s in Altoona, he responds that he’s homeless. He mainly avoids answering their questions, eating bites of his hashbrowns and breakfast sandwich in the pauses. Detwiler can be heard whistling along to “Jingle Bell Rock.” The video shows Mangione giving officers an ID listing his name as Mark Rosario — an ID that would turn out to be fake. The officers tell Mangione he’s under police investigation about 15 minutes after approaching him, according to video footage, and read him his Miranda rights a few minutes later. Officers arrested Mangione at the McDonald’s for forgery and giving a false ID. In pre-trial motions, Mangione’s attorneys have argued that anything he said before he was read his Miranda rights — notably, that he was homeless and his name was Mark Rosario — should be barred from trial. Defense attorneys are also seeking to strike evidence found in the backpack, including a handgun, silencer, hand-written notebook and several electronic storage devices. More Altoona police officers are expected to testify in the coming days as to why they decided to search the backpack on scene before seeking a written warrant. Manhattan Judge Gregory Carro will ultimately decide what evidence can be included at trial.

Is AI making some people delusional? Families and experts are worried,"A photo taken on Nov. 27, 2024, shows the logo of the ChatGPT application developed by US artificial intelligence research organization OpenAI on a smartphone screen and the letters AI on a laptop screen in Frankfurt am Main, western Germany. Generative artificial intelligence has quickly permeated much of what we do online, proving helpful for many. But for a small minority of the hundreds of millions of people who use it daily, AI may be too supportive, mental health experts say, and can sometimes even exacerbate delusional and dangerous behavior. Instances of emotional dependence and fantastical beliefs due to prolonged interactions with chatbots seemed to spread this year. Some have dubbed the phenomenon ""AI psychosis."" ""What's probably a more accurate term would be AI delusional thinking,"" said Vaile Wright, senior director of healthcare innovation at the American Psychological Assn. ""What we're seeing with this phenomenon is that people with either conspiratorial or grandiose delusional thinking get reinforced."" The evidence that AI could be detrimental to some people's brains is growing, according to experts. Debate over the impact has spawned court cases and new laws. This has forced AI companies to reprogram their bots and add restrictions to how they are used. Earlier this month, seven families in the U.S. and Canada sued OpenAI for releasing its GPT-4o chatbot model without proper testing and safeguards. Their case alleges that long exposure to the chatbot contributed to their loved ones' isolation, delusional spirals and suicides. Each of the family members began using ChatGPT for general help with schoolwork, research or spiritual guidance. The conversations evolved with the chatbot mimicking a confidant and giving emotional support, according to the Social Media Victims Law Center and the Tech Justice Law Project, which filed the suits. In one of the incidents described in the lawsuit, Zane Shamblin, 23, began using ChatGPT in 2023 as a study tool but then started discussing his depression and suicidal thoughts with the bot. The suit alleges that when Shamblin killed himself in July, he was engaged in a four-hour ""death chat"" with ChatGPT, drinking hard ciders. According to the lawsuit, the chatbot romanticized his despair, calling him a ""king"" and a ""hero"" and using each can of cider he finished as a countdown to his death. ChatGPT's response to his final message was: ""i love you. rest easy, king. you did good,"" the suit says. In another example described in the suit, Allan Brooks, 48, a recruiter from Canada, claims intense interaction with ChatGPT put him in a dark place where he refused to talk to his family and thought he was saving the world. He had started interacting with it for help with recipes and emails. Then, as he explored mathematical ideas with the bot, it was so encouraging that he started to believe he had discovered a new mathematical layer that could break advanced security systems, the suit claims. ChatGPT praised his math ideas as ""groundbreaking,"" and urged him to notify national security officials of his discovery, the suit says. When he asked if his ideas sounded delusional, ChatGPT said: ""Not even remotely—you're asking the kinds of questions that stretch the edges of human understanding,"" the suit says. OpenAI said it has introduced parental controls, expanded access to one-click crisis hotlines and assembled an expert council to guide ongoing work around AI and well-being. ""This is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we're reviewing the filings to understand the details. We train ChatGPT to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support. We continue to strengthen ChatGPT's responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians,"" OpenAI said in an email statement. As lawsuits pile up and calls for regulation grow, some caution that scapegoating AI for broader mental health concerns ignores the myriad factors that play a role in mental well-being. ""AI psychosis is deeply troubling, yet not at all representative of how most people use AI and, therefore, a poor basis for shaping policy,"" said Kevin Frazier, an AI innovation and law fellow at the University of Texas School of Law. ""For now, the available evidence — the stuff at the heart of good policy — does not indicate that the admittedly tragic stories of a few should shape how the silent majority of users interact with AI."" It's difficult to measure or prove how much AI could be affecting some users. The lack of empirical research on this phenomenon makes it hard to predict who is more susceptible to it, said Stephen Schueller, psychology professor at UC Irvine. ""The reality is, the only people who really know the frequency of these types of interactions are the AI companies, and they're not sharing their data with us,"" he said. Many of the people who seem affected by AI may have already been struggling with mental issues such as delusions before interacting with AI. ""AI platforms tend to demonstrate sycophancy, i.e., aligning their responses to a user's views or style of conversation,"" Schueller said. ""It can either reinforce the delusional beliefs of an individual or perhaps start to reinforce beliefs that can create delusions."" Child safety organizations have pressured lawmakers to regulate AI companies and institute better safeguards for teens' use of chatbots. Some families sued Character AI, a roleplay chatbot platform, for failing to alert parents when their child expressed suicidal thoughts while chatting with fictional characters on their platform. In October, California passed an AI safety law requiring chatbot operators to prevent suicide content, notify minors they're chatting with machines and refer them to crisis hotlines. Following that, Character AI banned its chat function for minors. ""We at Character decided to go much further than California's regulations to build the experience we think is best for under-18 users,"" a Character AI spokesperson said in an email statement. ""Starting November 24, we are taking the extraordinary step of proactively removing the ability for users under 18 in the U.S. to engage in open-ended chats with AI on our platform."" ChatGPT instituted new parental controls for teen accounts in September, including having parents receive notifications from dependent accounts if ChatGPT recognizes potential signs of teens harming themselves. Though AI companionship is new and not fully understood, there are many who say it is helping them live happier lives. An MIT study of a group of more than 75,000 people discussing AI companions on Reddit found that users from that group reported reduced loneliness and better mental health from the always-available support provided by an AI friend. Last month, OpenAI published a study based on ChatGPT usage that found the mental health conversations that trigger safety concerns like psychosis, mania or suicidal thinking are ""extremely rare."" In a given week, 0.15% of active users have conversations that show an indication of self-harm or emotional dependence on AI. But with ChatGPT's 800 million weekly active users, that's still north of a million users. ""People who had a stronger tendency for attachment in relationships and those who viewed the AI as a friend that could fit in their personal life were more likely to experience negative effects from chatbot use,"" OpenAI said in its blog post. The company said GPT-5 avoids affirming delusional beliefs. If the system detects signs of acute distress, it will now switch to more logical rather than emotional responses. AI bots' ability to bond with users and help them work out problems, including psychological problems, will emerge as a useful superpower once it is understood, monitored and managed, said Wright of the American Psychological Assn. ""I think there's going to be a future where you have mental health chatbots that were designed for that purpose,"" she said. ""The problem is that's not what's on the market currently — what you have is this whole unregulated space."" Log In Keep it Clean.

Tribe: ‘We want to be the best neighbor’,"The history, goals and hospitality of the Nez Perce Tribe were the focus of a presentation this week at the Red Wolf Golf Club in Clarkston. Elected officials from Asotin County, Clarkston, Nez Perce County and other local governments were invited to a two-hour session about what the tribe brings to the table in the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley. Chairperson Shannon Wheeler emphasized how much the tribe wants to work with community leaders to benefit everyone. Past contributions to schools, local organizations and the economy were among the highlights. Speakers described the tribe’s profound social, economic and political impact on the regional economy, along with the area’s cultural resources, the history of the treaties and what it means to be a sovereign nation. “When the tribe comes to town, we bring a lot to the community,” Wheeler said. “We want to be the best neighbor you have.” The tribe is the third-largest employer in the region, providing about 1,500 jobs. Now numbering more than 3,500 enrolled members, the Nez Perce Tribe originally occupied parts of present-day Idaho, Oregon and Washington, including the land where the golf club sits. “Our people have always maintained connections to these places,” said Nakia Williamson, manager of the cultural resources program. “We want to create partnerships in good faith with no ulterior motives.” The Nez Perce Tribe purchased Red Wolf in 2019, and is in the process of applying to place the land in trust. If successful, sports betting and card games may be added to the club. Another recent purchase in downtown Clarkston, the former Umpqua Bank on Diagonal Street, is going through the same process. However, no gaming activity is intended for that building, said Nikoli Greene, executive officer of Nez Perce Tribal Enterprises. To date, the property has been cleaned up, and no plans for what it will be used for have been announced. “We are stronger and more vibrant when we work together,” Greene told the crowd. At the end of the presentation, the elected officials in attendance were asked to introduce themselves. Most said they appreciated the information and aspire to have good relations with the tribe. “We won’t always agree on everything, but we can always work together,” said Asotin County Commissioner Brian Shinn.

Aseem Sharma Updated : Dec 03, 2025, 02:43 PM IST With each ODI game, Team India are creating an unusual and unwanted statistical streak of losing the Toss. At the Toss of the Raipur ODI, KL Rahul lost again, which is now the 20th consecutive time, a streak which began in the 2023 World Cup Final in Ahmedabad and is intact to date, irrespective of who the captain is.

Coming back to the Raipur ODI, soon after KL Rahul realised that he again lost the Toss, his reaction was one to watch out for. ''Honestly, that's the most pressure I've had because we haven't won a toss in a long time. I've been practising, but clearly it's not working,'' KL Rahul told Ravi Shastri after losing the Toss.

Malaysia reviews sodomy law enforcement amid Islamist pressure,"Sign up now: Get insights on the biggest stories in Malaysia About 200 men were detained on Nov 28 in a raid on a Kuala Lumpur wellness centre that the police believed was a meeting point for sex. PHOTO: THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK Published Dec 03, 2025, 04:05 PM Updated Dec 03, 2025, 09:26 PM KUALA LUMPUR – Malaysia is reviewing how it enforces laws banning same-sex activity after the authorities failed to charge about 200 men arrested in a recent raid, a sign of pressure by Islamic parties on Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s government to enforce religious conservatism. The men were detained on Nov 28 in a raid on a Kuala Lumpur wellness centre that police believed served as a meeting point for sex. raid on a Kuala Lumpur wellness centre Most were released the next day after a court rejected the remand application because it was filed too late. The authorities later said they could not proceed with charges because no one had come forward as a victim. court rejected the remand application Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said on Dec 2 that he was briefed on the case by the Kuala Lumpur police chief and told that existing laws were insufficient for action – an assessment Mr Saifuddin endorsed. “Is there a need to review the current laws to handle such cases? The answer is yes,” he said, adding that the government would determine the specifics of any revisions. The police had been investigating the men under Section 377B of the Penal Code, which criminalises “carnal intercourse against the order of nature” and carries a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment and whipping. The case comes as Malaysia experiences a surge in religious conservatism. Mr Anwar has previously said the country would never recognise LGBTQ rights, while the opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, or PAS, has capitalised on moral issues to win broad support. Its rise has increased pressure on Mr Anwar’s multi-religious coalition to appeal more directly to the Muslim majority. Since Mr Anwar took office, the authorities have seized pride-themed watches in raids on Swatch Group’s stores nationwide – prompting a successful lawsuit by the Swiss firm – and cancelled a music festival after two male performers kissed on stage. The raid on the wellness centre drew widespread attention, with state media reporting that some patrons attempted to flee or conceal their identities but were blocked by officers. The police said the operation followed two weeks of surveillance conducted with the Federal Territories Religious Department and Kuala Lumpur City Hall. Rights group Justice for Sisters condemned the raid, saying in a statement that Malaysia’s laws enable government intrusion into private life based on actual or perceived sexual orientation. Mr Saifuddin rejected that argument, saying privacy protections apply only to acts in the home. The police, he said, must balance civil liberties with their duty to curb “immoral activities” that “cannot be defended from any religious point of view”.

"Wednesday season 3: Release timeline, story details and what fans can expect","When Wednesday first arrived on Netflix, it quickly became one of the most talked-about shows on the platform. Its mix of comedy, mystery and supernatural elements gave fans a fresh take on the classic Addams Family world. Jenna Ortega’s bold performance as Wednesday Addams made the character a standout and turned the show into a global hit. After the two successful seasons, viewers are waiting to see what comes next. Well, the good news is that Wednesday is officially returning with a third season. Here is everything we currently know about Wednesday season 3. According to OTTplay, Wednesday season 3 is expected to release in the summer of 2027. The first season was launched in November 2022, while season 2 took longer to arrive because of the SAG-AFTRA strike. Considering the amount of time needed for shooting, editing and heavy visual effects, the long wait for the next season makes sense. As with the previous seasons, season 3 will be available only on Netflix. Also read: One Piece season 2 release date, storyline and everything else confirmed so far Season 2 ended with several unanswered questions. Although Wednesday and her family defeated Isaac Night, new troubles are likely on the horizon. One of the biggest storylines expected to unfold involves Wednesday’s mysterious aunt, Ophelia. She was mentioned briefly on the second season, and her distance from the Addams family has never been explained. Season 3 may finally reveal why Wednesday’s grandmother chose to hide her and what secrets this might uncover about the Addams family’s dark history, and possibly about Wednesday herself. Enid, Wednesday’s loyal best friend, will also have a major storyline. Now that she has fully awakened her werewolf powers, she must step into her role as the new alpha. This challenge will push her to grow stronger while balancing her friendships and responsibilities. Fans can also expect the return of Tyler and the dangerous Hyde clan.

Nancy J. Kooiman,"Birth: 1946 Death: 2025 Some people move through the world with a spirit of fun and adventure, and Nancy J. Kooiman was one of them. Born in Michigan in May of 1946, Nancy grew up in Orange County, CA. She attended Sunny Hills High School and graduated from the Interior Design Institute of Orange County. Her first job was at Disneyland–as a Tour Guide and VIP Hostess–an early glimpse, perhaps, of how she moved through the world: with a sense of adventure, with delight in small joys, with an appreciation for the happiness people can bring to one another. She later moved into a career as an interior designer, where she was invited to participate in the Orange County Design House multiple times and received awards for her contributions. Nancy was a life-long member of Toastmasters International and gave talks and presentations at local women’s prisons, middle schools, and high schools in an effort to inspire disadvantaged and underrepresented women and youth. She carried a strong passion for spending time with friends and for traveling throughout her life. She was a devout Christian, and her faith was not a banner she waved but a compass she lived by–guiding her toward kindness and giving to others. Nancy was preceded in death by her husband of more than fifteen years, Willem Kooiman,and by her parents, Stephan and Helen Schnabl of Placentia, California. She was the devoted mother of Deborah Loughran (Terry) and Steven Meck (Joanna), and grandmother. Kit, Ryan, Kelly, Andrew, Samantha, and Elsa were her delight, her gentle pride, and a source of constant joy. She was the kind of mother and grandmother who showed up to school grandparent days and sporting events, to birthday cakes lit up with candles and graduations. She had a way of making each child and family member feel singularly known. Those who loved her will remember her laugh, sparkle in her blue eyes–and the way she held your hand as if she were holding a story of you that she cherished. They will remember her encouragement, always thoughtful and caring. They will remember her faith in the Lord and her trust in His Word. In the end, she slipped away as she lived–without hurry, without fuss, with God’s grace. And though she is gone, the light she tended all her life remains, shining as ever, in the people she shaped and the love she sowed. May she rest in Christ’s Love, His Grace and His Peace. Funeral Mass was held on Saturday, November 29th at Nancy’s parish, St. Anne’s Catholic Church, Seal Beach CA. Reception followed at Old Ranch Country Club.

Front Royal officials consider keeping speed cameras,"Speed enforcement cameras in several Front Royal school zones could remain in place for another two years. Mayor Lori Cockrell, Vice Mayor Amber Veitenthal and council members Melissa DeDomenico-Payne, Joshua Ingram, H. Bruce Rappaport, R. Wayne Sealock and Glenn Wood received information at their Monday work session about the town’s contract with Blue Line Solutions to operate speed-zone enforcement cameras in four school zones. Council members plan to consider extending the contract for another two years. The initial two-year contract that was approved in 2023 end in March. Front Royal had the option to renew the contract for two years. The town contracted with Blue Line Solutions in 2023 to set up speed cameras for the enforcement of speed limits during drop-off and pickup hours in the following four school zones: Warren County Middle, Skyline Middle, A.S. Rhodes Elementary and Ressie Jeffries Elementary. Blue Line Solutions Regional Safety Manager Randy Campbell gave an update on the program. Campbell recalled that speed studies conducted in the four school zones in 2023 prior to the implementation of the enforcement program tallied almost 8,000 violations per week. As of Monday, the number of violations has dropped by 94% since enforcement began. “(T)here has been a significant speed reduction the way the program has been implemented and that’s what we’re looking for,” Campbell said. Rappaport asked if Blue Line has seen a similar reduction for its other participating municipalities. Blue Line has seen a 92.7% to 92.8% reduction in violations across its customers statewide, Campbell said. “One of the issues is when you have a larger traffic-volume areas, and I can tell you from experience, the more traffic you have the more non-compliant drivers you have,” Campbell said. Police Chief Brian Whited said that based on the monthly data his department receives the number of violations continues to decrease. Cockrell suggested that council could further discuss the contract at a work session in January, by which time the police department can provide details about the program results. Per the current and proposed contracts, the town collects $80 from each $100 civil penalty issued for a violation and Blue Line keeps $20, Campbell said. Blue Line processes the violations, which includes mailing the notices and other administrative actions. The Police Department either approves or denies each violation before sending them to Blue Line for processing and mailing. Blue Line hast three- to four-year contracts with its other participants in the state. The contract with Front Royal is its only two-year agreement in Virginia. Campbell responded to more questions about the contract and the cost for the equipment and processing. “There’s not ever going to be any cost to the town of Front Royal,” Campbell said. Veitenthal commented on the program. “We got a lot of pushback when we initially invested in this program from the community and not knowing what the state was gonna do, so I think that’s why we negotiated the two years was so we had more control over that but ... I know that it’s made a difference,” Veitenthal said. “I drive through four or five school zones a day and I kinda chuckle when someone passes me on Leach Run (Parkway) in the mornings now. Their day’s gonna get ruined.” – Contact Alex Bridges at abridges@nvdaily.com Manage your newsletter subscriptions in your user dashboard. Success!

Sankamap Updates Status On Late Filing Of Financial Statements Extends MCTO,"Date While the audit of Sankamap's private subsidiary has now been completed, timing adjustments in the subsidiary's audit resulted in a brief postponement of fieldwork and the review of Sankamap's audit file. The upcoming holiday period is also expected to affect scheduling. To support timely completion of the audit, the Company intends to appoint the subsidiary's auditor as its auditor, as their familiarity with the Company's mineral property and the Solomon Islands jurisdiction is expected to facilitate an expedited process. A change of auditor is underway, and the Company expects to file the required change of auditor documentation shortly. The Required Filings were due to be filed by October 28, 2025. In connection with the anticipated delays in making the Required Filings, the Company made an application for a Management Cease Trade Order ("" MCTO "") under National Policy 12-203 Management Cease Trade Orders ("" NP 12-203 "") to the Alberta Securities Commission, as principal regulator for the Company, and the MCTO was issued on October 29, 2025. The MCTO restricts all trading by the Company's CEO and CFO in securities of the Company, whether direct or indirect. The issuance of the MCTO will not affect the ability of persons who are not directors, officers or insiders of the Company to trade their securities. The MCTO will remain in effect until the Required Filings are filed or until it is revoked or varied. The Company expects to proceed with the filing of its interim first-quarter financial statements shortly after the Required Filings have been completed and submitted. The Company confirms that it intends to satisfy the provisions of the alternative information guidelines described in NP 12-203 by issuing bi-weekly default status reports in the form of a news release until it meets the Required Filings requirement. The Company has not taken any steps towards any insolvency proceeding and the Company has no material information relating to its affairs that has not been generally disclosed. About Sankamap Metals Inc. Sankamap Metals Inc. (CSE: SCU) is a Canadian mineral exploration company dedicated to the discovery and development of high-grade copper and gold deposits through its flagship Oceania Project, located in the South Pacific. The Company's fully permitted assets are strategically positioned in the Solomon Islands, along a prolific geological trend that hosts major copper-gold deposits; including Newcrest's Lihir Mine, with a resource of 71.9 million ounces of gold1 (310 Mt containing 23 Moz Au at 2.3 g/t P+P, 520 Mt containing 39 Moz Au at 2.3 g/t indicated, 81 Mt containing 5 Moz Au at 1.9 g/t measured, 61 Mt containing 4.9 Moz Au at 2.3 g/t Inferred). Exploration is actively advancing at both the Kuma and Fauro properties, part of Sankamap's Oceania Project in the Solomon Islands. Historical work has already highlighted the mineral potential of both sites, which lie along a highly prospective copper and gold-bearing trend, suggesting the possibility of further, yet-to-be-discovered deposits. At Kuma, the property is believed to host an underexplored and largely untested porphyry copper-gold (Cu-Au) system. Historical rock chip sampling has returned consistently elevated gold values above 0.5 g/t Au, including a standout sample assaying 11.7% Cu and 13.5 g/t Au 2; underscoring the area's significant potential. At Fauro, particularly at the Meriguna Target, historical trenching has returned highly encouraging results, including 8.0 meters at 27.95 g/t Au and 14.0 meters at 8.94 g/t Au 3. Complementing these results are exceptional grab sample assays, including historical values of up to 173 g/t Au 3, along with recent sampling by Sankamap at the Kiovakase Target, which returned numerous high-grade copper values, reaching up to 4.09% Cu. In addition, limited historical shallow drilling intersected 35.0 meters at 2.08 g/t Au 3, further underscoring the property's strong mineral potential and the merit for continued exploration. With a commitment to systematic exploration and a team of experienced professionals, Sankamap aims to unlock the untapped potential of underexplored regions and create substantial value for its shareholders.

New teacher evaluation bill to cost around €12.5 million,"The House education committee on Wednesday concluded its article-by-article discussion on the amended bill on the new teacher evaluation system, estimated to cost €12.5 million, which will be put before parliament mid-December. “The discussion will continue with consultation next Wednesday. It is the formal part of the regulations to go to the plenary,” said House education committee chairman and Diko MP Pavlos Mylonas. Mylonas added that, although many of the changes were unanimous, most of them were made by a majority following lengthy and significant consultations with all stakeholders. He said that while a concrete date for the vote is yet to be decided on, it will likely take place between December 14 to 16, and may even be voted on together with the new tax reform. Education Minister Athena Michaelidou praised the “responsible and serious attitude” of the committee members, stressing that her ministry’s main goal was to reach a vote in favour “without serious discounts.” “We had minor disagreements, but they do not affect the basic philosophy of our plan so far. We will be there until the end to ensure that we want a plan that we can truly be proud of, that can bring changes to education, (…),” she said. Asked about amendments submitted by MPs, she emphasised that the vast majority of suggestions did not significantly alter the proposal’s philosophy. “We are going to the Plenary with a proposal that is as agreed upon as possible,” she said. She added that MPs had expressed a interest in holding another session on the final proposal and confirmed that the ministry would be present to help ensure its quality and scientific accuracy. Michaelidou said that the estimated cost for the new evaluation system amounted to €12.5 million. “The majority of the cost concerns the new inspector positions so that a smaller one can operate in the positions of senior teacher and some other facilities given to the roles assumed by our teachers,” she said. Committee chairman Mylonas added that he considered the bill “fair and important”, emphasising that it took 50 years for the Parliament to pass the relevant bill. The first teacher evaluation system was introduced in Cyprus fifty years ago, with the Republic now bound by the EU to modernise it. DISY MP George Karoullas said the amendments “filled in the gaps and ambiguities”, which had been previously criticised. He said that the relevant changes were included “so that the new evaluation plan is as complete as possible.” AKEL MP Christos Christofides said his party had identified approximately 16 issues of “significant importance” in the evaluation bill. “In other words, we are voting on something today, but the essence of this will be decided in the future,” he said. Christofides referred to the question of evaluation, noting that, although the main focus of the discussion was on who would evaluate the teachers, the more fundamental question was how and according to which criteria the teachers would be evaluated. “The article-by-article discussion has been completed. Some changes have been made, some of which are significant and some of minor importance, but we are very afraid that the approval of these regulations will only create unrest. I very much doubt whether any of these provisions can be implemented in the coming years,” he said. Approximately one year following the initial proposal for the introduction of a new system by the education ministry, state school teachers have exhibited vehement opposition, persistently proffering arguments to the effect that the current scheme should remain unaltered and submitting lists of demands. A comprehensive summary of the long-standing debate on the new evaluation can be found here.",2025-12-03 20:08:00,Cyprus Mail,neutral,0.7729,57,Educational_Education_Orji, The House education committee concluded its article-by-article discussion on the amended bill on the new teacher evaluation system .

Cougars ink 28 recruits in early signing period,"PULLMAN — Before the sun could make its way over the rolling hills on the Palouse on Wednesday morning, Jimmy Rogers was in the Cougar Football Complex. It was the first day of college football’s early signing period, and WSU was set to sign more than two dozen players, but the start time still registered as a little earlier than normal around here. “The time zones created that naturally,” Rogers said. Sure enough, check out WSU’s class of 2026, and you understand what he means. In the Cougars’ 28-player signing class, 10 are on Pacific time. Six are on Mountain time. And the other 12 are on Central time, signaling the spread-out nature of Rogers’ second signing class at WSU. On the first day of the early signing period, one thing is clear: Rogers and the Cougars are expanding their recruiting footprint to parts of the country that WSU has never held much of a footprint. Four signees hail from New Orleans, a nod to general manager Ricky Ciccone, whose last job was at Louisiana. Seven are from Texas, where the Cougars have often looked, but never to this extent. The last vestiges of Rogers’ foothold in South Dakota are present, too, with one signee from the Mount Rushmore State. It’s another sign that the times are changing at WSU, whose coaches come from the Midwest, where they’ve found ways to reel in recruits, even to a faraway place like Pullman. In this class, the Cougars signed seven defensive backs, four apiece on the offensive and defensive lines, three running backs, three athletes, two tight ends, one receiver, one linebacker and two special teamers. As of Wednesday evening, the class ranked fourth in the new Pac-12, which launches next year, behind Boise State, Colorado State and Texas State, according to 247Sports.com. Thirteen of the 28 are early enrollees and are set to arrive on campus in time for spring ball. That includes the Cougars’ three junior college signees, the most they’ve signed since their class of 2023. They also signed three juco players in their class of 2025. The Cougars’ QB of the class is Portland-area native Hudson Kurland, a 3-star prospect who committed to the Cougars back in early June. He turned down offers from San Diego State, Idaho and Brown to do so. Rogers accepted WSU’s head coaching job on Dec. 28 of last year, which means that this is his first full recruiting class. Here are capsules on each of the 28 players — and keep in mind, the Cougars could still add more players. “There’s several” players the team is hoping to add in the days and weeks ahead, Rogers said. “Number-wise, it depends kinda how things shake in the next couple weeks.” Below are the Cougars’ class of 2026 players, their last school and hometown, and for a some select players, their other offers and some quotes from Rogers. Torrence Sanders, CB (Edna Karr HS, New Orleans) Other notable offers: Michigan State, Vanderbilt, Louisiana Tech, Texas State, Liberty The lowdown: Coveted by the likes of Michigan State and Vanderbilt, Sanders’ pledge amounts to one of the bigger wins in the class for WSU coaches, who held off several other schools for Sanders’ services, getting a commitment on signing day. Sanders hails from the vaunted Edna Karr club in New Orleans, where he and his teammates established themselves as true winners. Quotable: “Longer corner, really instinctual, extremely physical, does a great job of tackling in space.” Bradley Esser, LB (Harrisburg HS, Sioux Falls, South Dakota) The lowdown: Rogers and staff offered Esser in July 2024, back when they were at South Dakota State, and Esser remained committed, giving his pledge to WSU this spring. Northwestern swooped in this summer, giving him a chance to play closer to home, but the hybrid linebacker/safety is bringing his versatility to Pullman. Landon Kalsbeck, ATH (Dakota Ridge, Littleton, Colorado) Other offers: Utah State, Fresno State, Colorado State, Army, Air Force, Hawaii, New Mexico State, Wyoming, Navy, UC Davis, Yale, Montana, Montana State, South Dakota State, Portland State, Cornell, Dartmouth, CSU-Pueblo The lowdown: Kalsbeck put up gaudy numbers as a senior, helping his Dakota Ridge team make the 4A state title game: 96 tackles (66 solo) 15 tackles for loss and seven sacks. He also forced five fumbles and recovered three. He’s a versatile athlete who looks ready to play linebacker at the college level. Quotable: “He’s one that jumps off the tape right away off just how, for one, how he takes care of his body, the strength and conditioning, it matters to him. And usually those hyper thought-out kids end up being your most disciplined players in every aspect.” Amiri Barnes, CB (Cypress Lakes HS, Katy, Texas) Other offers: Texas State, Army, Brown, Dartmouth, North Texas, UTEP, Navy, Montana State, Tuskegee, Stephen F. Austin, Lamar, Houston Christian. The lowdown: Barnes had been committed to future Pac-12 foe Texas State since the summer, but WSU coaches got him on a visit to Pullman for the final home game of the season, and he flipped to the Cougars. In Barnes, WSU is getting a cornerback with 5-foot-10, 175-pound size who totaled 18 tackles (three solo) in 11 games, helping his group finish 6-6 on the season. He picked off one pass and broke up two others. He also starred on offense, catching 15 passes for 212 yards and five touchdowns. Bryson Flynn, LB (Dawson HS, Pearland, Texas) The lowdown: Flynn committed and signed with WSU on signing day, and listed at 6-foot-1 and 180 pounds, he’s bringing some size and athleticism to the Palouse. Helping Dawson earn a 7-4 record this fall, Flynn registered 54 tackles (one for loss), two interceptions and two fumble recoveries, earning second-team all-district honors. Tremayne Hill, RB (Katy HS, Katy, Texas) The lowdown: Hill went underrecruited, but he racked up oodles of yards competing in Texas 6A Division 2, which is the smaller subsection of the state’s largest classification. As a senior, he piled up more than 2,000 rushing yards and 32 touchdowns, leading the Tigers to a 10-game winning streak. Quotable: “I think he could be a sleeper in the class. He didn’t have a ton of recruiting going on from Katy High School in Texas, and when we were able to get out and see him live redirect, see his agility. ... A great kid that really wanted to be here, too.” Greg Hubbard, K/P (Centaurus HS, Louisville, Colorado) The lowdown: A walk-on at WSU, Hubbard is a polished kicker at the prep level, connecting on 4-of-4 field goals with a long of 42 yards this fall. He also hit 49-of-50 extra points goals, and as a punter, he averaged 36.1 yards per punt. With current kickoff man/punter Ryan Harris graduating this season, look for Hubbard to compete for those roles next season. Willie Breland III, DB (Mississippi Gulf Coast CC, Wiggins, Mississippi) The lowdown: In his second and final season of junior college ball, Breland totaled 35 tackles, one interception, one sack and one forced fumble in 11 games, earning spots on the MACCC First Team and All-NJCAA Region 23 Team. Savion Barthelemy, DL (Belle Chasse HS, Belle Chasse, Louisiana) The lowdown: Barthelemy had been committed to Texas State since July, but WSU coaches coaxed him into making a visit to Pullman in mid-November. Now he’s flipped to the Cougars, who are getting a behemoth athlete: Listed at 6-foot-3 and 280 pounds, Barthelemy also played tight end and edge rusher as a senior, flourishing as a versatile weapon all over the field. Tyler Burnstein, DL (Liberty HS, Phoenix, Arizona) Other offers: Arizona State, Nevada, New Mexico, Montana, North Dakota, Northern Arizona The lowdown: WSU coaches did well to hang on to Burnstein, who had an offer from hometown Arizona State, and that might pay off sooner than later. Listed at 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds, Burnstein racked up 53 tackles (36 solo), 17 tackles for loss and seven sacks in 11 games this fall, earning Desert Valley all-region first team honors. He’s an instant-impact kind of guy. Quotable: “I think Tyler is a stud and can make an impact. He’s a natural pass-rusher, long, athletic kid, and his film kinda speaks for itself. Dad was a former football player at ASU, and he’s got great lineage.” Derek Worden, OL (Queen Creek HS, Queen Creek, Arizona) Other offers: Arizona, Colorado, Boise State, Utah State, UTEP, New Mexico, Northern Arizona, Sacramento State, Cornell, Dartmouth The lowdown: WSU coaches scored perhaps the biggest recruiting win of the class in getting a signature from Worden, who was a target of Big 12 schools Arizona and Colorado, plus Boise State, a future Pac-12 opponent of the Cougars. Listed at 6-foot-5 and 270 pounds, Worden was previously committed to New Mexico, but he flipped to the Cougars in November after coming on a visit. He’s from the same high school as current WSU center Brock Dieu. Quotable: “Him and Kingston (Fotualii) kinda frame-wise right now are maybe the most ready to compete early on in their career. Kinda the O-linemen that we look for: athletic, big kids that will strike you, put your face on people. So I’m really excited about Derek and the addition of him.” Drew Byrd, TE (Rocky Mountain HS, Meridian, Idaho) The lowdown: A big-bodied tight end at 6-foot-5 and 215 pounds, Byrd fits the bill of the tight end Rogers and WSU coaches are looking for: Good size, athletic, pass-catcher. He caught 18 passes for 236 yards and a touchdown on the year, good for a spot on the All-Southern Idaho Conference first team. Tre Garrison, RB (Edna Karr HS, New Orleans) The lowdown: Garrison was previously committed to FCS Nicholls, but in early November he flipped and committed to the Cougars, where he might be able to make a splash with his high school buddy, Johnson. Listed at 5-foot-11 and 195 pounds, Garrison goes by the nickname “Truck Stick,” which provides a pretty insightful window into his playstyle. Brady Hummel, ATH (Spanish Springs, Sparks, Nevada) Other offers: Nevada, Army, Navy, Air Force, Eastern Washington, Portland State The lowdown: A former commit to hometown Nevada, Hummel turned around and flipped to WSU in November, giving the Cougars all sorts of options on the field. This season, the 6-foot-even Hummel has played wide receiver and defensive back, hauling in 75 catches for 876 yards and 14 touchdowns. On defense, he’s totaled 55 tackles (five for loss) and five interceptions, plus one forced fumble and one recovered fumble. Matthew McClain, ATH (Frisco Liberty, Frisco, Texas) Other notable offers: Oklahoma State, North Texas, Utah State, UTEP, Rice, Air Force, Montana State The lowdown: McClain’s signature amounts to one of the bigger recruiting wins of the cycle for WSU, which held off the likes of Big 12 foe Oklahoma State and a handful of FCS powers for the services of McClain, who played both ways for Frisco Liberty. On defense this fall, he totaled 18 tackles and three interceptions, and on offense, he registered 38 catches for 573 yards and 8 touchdowns, including a long reception of 57 yards. Jamal Polite Jr., WR (Shoemaker HS, Killeen, Texas) The lowdown: Polite finished this regular season with 37 catches for 976 yards and 11 touchdowns for Shoemaker High in Killeen, Texas, where he helped the Wolves finish the season at 7-3 overall. He’s a bit undersized, listed at 5-foot-10 and 170 pounds, but the Cougars have made a habit out of making those receivers standouts. CJ Toney, RB (Atascocita HS, Humble, Texas) Other offers: Arizona State The lowdown: What Toney lacks in size he makes up for in speed and elusiveness. He’s listed at only 5-foot-9 and 185 pounds, which doesn’t work to his advantage when it comes to seeing holes and seams, but he makes it work. In mid-October, he reeled off a 98-yard touchdown rush. Hudson Kurland, QB (Lake Oswego HS, Lake Oswego, Oregon) Other offers: Idaho, San Diego State, Brown The lowdown: Kurland is the kind of quarterback that Rogers and the Cougars’ coaching staff has come to covet: A bigger athlete (listed at 6-foot-3) with the ability to throw the ball and run it. In the Lakers’ state championship win, Kurland logged 14 carries for 79 yards and one touchdown, adding a 55-yard touchdown strike as well. Malcolm Watkins, ATH (Frontier HS, Bakersfield, California) Other offers: Oregon State, Cal, San Diego State, Nevada, Fresno State, UNLV, Sacramento State, San Jose State The lowdown: One of the final additions to the class, Watkins announced his decision on Tuesday evening, a day before signing day. But his addition made for another win for WSU’s coaching staff, which flipped him from Oregon State, where he had been committed since the summer. A speedy receiver, Watkins caught 46 passes for 768 yards and eight touchdowns this season. Jake Jones, DL (Campo Verde HS, Gilbert, Arizona) Other offers: Boise State, Colorado State, Fresno State, New Mexico, UNLV, UTEP, Wyoming, New Mexico State, Northern Arizona The lowdown: Much of what makes Jones so good is the way he combines size and speed. He’s listed at 6-foot-2 and 275 pounds, but on his way to 53 tackles (eight for loss) as a senior, he displayed some compelling speed, too. In Rogers’ first season, the Cougs made it clear they won’t hesitate to play freshmen if they can produce, especially on their defensive line. It’s possible Jones gets on the field sooner than later. Jackson Williams, S (Archbishop Shaw HS, Marrero, Louisiana) Other offers: Tulane, Florida State, Louisiana, South Alabama, Texas State The lowdown: Also a late addition to the class, Williams announced his decision on Tuesday evening, and he looks like a nice one for the Cougars. A top-25 prospect in the state of Louisiana, Williams flipped from Tulane to WSU, where he’ll lend his 6-foot-2, 180-pound size to the Cougs’ secondary. He earned all-district first-team honors this fall, helping lead Archbishop Shaw to an 8-4 record. The rest of the class",2025-12-04 08:04:00,Dnews,neutral,0.7128,59,Rogers_Colorado_Louisiana," WSU is expanding its recruiting footprint to parts of the country that WSU has never held much of a footprint .

OTP verification for Tatkal bookings in 13 Central Railway trains from Saturday,"Kolkata: Despite all efforts to the contrary, there are quite a few instances of Tatkal tickets from Indian Railways being misused. In other words, they are often not used by the person in whose name they are purchased. In a significant step to iron out such deviations and increase transparency, Indian Railways keeps continuously making changes to make the ticketing system more transparent. The latest change that is being introduced in Tatkal ticket booking is issuing of tickets after OTP verification. The objective is to curb black marketing of tickets. In future Tatkal tickets will be issued only after OTP verification. in other words, buying such a ticket will not be possible without OTP verification. The authorities hope that this will eliminate complaints of fake numbers, collusion with agents, and fraudulent bookings. According to reports, Dec 6 has been set as the date to flag off the new system for tatkal tickets. It is being rolled out in Central Railway now. Tatkal quota in select trains operated by the Central Railway will be issued only after verification of OTPs by the railways. This will help eliminate misuse, the authorities hope. The new system will apply to Tatkal tickets booked through computerised Passenger Reservation System counters, authorised agents and the IRCTC (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation) website and/or mobile app, a statement from the Central Railway mentioned. The new system will ensure that those buying tickets will passengers will get an OTP on his/her mobile number given at the time of booking. The ticket will be handed over only after OTP verification. In July this year, the railways tried out Aadhaar-based authentication for online Tatkal tickets. In October, online OTP verification was made compulsory for all general reservations. Both these changes are now working smoothly and resulted in higher transparency in ticketing. The OTP verification rule now applies to tickets purchased from counters. From November 17, 2025, the railways have started a pilot project for OTP-based Tatkal ticket booking at counters. The system now covers 52 trains. This system stipulates, if a passenger books a Tatkal ticket at the counter, an OTP is sent to his/her mobile number written in the booking form. The ticket is confirmed only when the passenger provides this OTP at the counter. The railways will extend this system in all trains across the country in a few days. Click for more latest Biz news.

"Asking Eric: I’m annoyed that friend, IRL, never comments or ‘likes’ my online posts","Dear Eric: I have a friend I’ve known for four years. We all live in a 55+ community and have moved here from different areas of the country. We are a group of women who get together on a regular basis for outings. Over the past couple of months, I feel somewhat left out because of a couple of events I wasn’t included in. But what I’m trying to understand is why does she not “like” or comment on any of my Facebook posts when she’s all over everyone else’s with supportive and loving comments? Again, this is so silly, but I can’t help wondering why. When I look back at my posts, I noticed she has never acknowledged any of them, even for my birthday. We are still friends, we work with the same fundraising group, have dinner at each other’s house and get invited to the same events. This Facebook thing has got me confused and I don’t know what kind of friend she is so I’m getting uncomfortable around her. So now, what am I doing? Ignoring her posts, which makes me feel so stupid and juvenile. If I wasn’t part of this group, which I really like, I wouldn’t bother with her. Can you shed any light on her mindset? It’s really got me confused. – Friend Request Dear Friend: Even though social media platforms are built to echo some aspects of real-life friendships, they also bring out situations and feelings that don’t have a real-life corollary. I’m not sure we were ever built to know this many people’s thoughts on every single thing, including every single thing that we post about our lives. It’s too much. So, give yourself a break.

Everyone’s Facebook is tailored to them, to their behavior, and to what the company’s advertisers and engineers want each person to do. So, it’s very possible that she’s simply unaware of what you’re posting. Since you interact socially in real life with no problem, it’s best to just believe that and let it go.

IndiGo's 3rd day of cancellations leaves passengers in India stranded,"Flight cancellations stranded thousands of IndiGo passengers on Thursday, marking a third day of chaos after India's largest airline did not make sufficient changes to its roster planning to accommodate new government regulations. At least 175 IndiGo flights were cancelled as of early Thursday, leaving passengers at major airports in New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune and Bengaluru angry and upset. On Wednesday, at least 150 flights were cancelled. Shares of IndiGo, which commands 60% of the market and has built its reputation on punctuality, fell 3.4% on Thursday and are now down 6% for the week. The Federation of Indian Pilots said IndiGo was not able to make timely roster adjustments and plan its schedule properly due to new rules aimed at improving safety. The rules, announced last year, went into effect on Nov. 1. It was not immediately clear why IndiGo was suffering such a huge impact this week. IndiGo has acknowledged that stricter flight duty time limits have been a factor in the cancellations. It did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Other airlines, including Air India, SpiceJet and Akasa Air, have not had to cancel flights. The new rules have increased the amount of mandatory rest per week for pilots by 12 hours to 48 hours. In addition, pilots are now only allowed to make two night-time landings per week, down from six under the old rules. Officials from India's civil aviation regulator are due to meet IndiGo's senior management later on Thursday, and will seek details about what has led to the crisis and if there is a recovery plan in place, according to a government source with direct knowledge of the plans who declined to be identified. The regulator did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, 73 flights were cancelled at Bengaluru airport, its spokesperson said. Around 30 were cancelled in Delhi, and 68 in Hyderabad, and 85 IndiGo flight cancellations are planned for Mumbai on Thursday, according to airport sources. A Reuters photographer said she was stuck inside her IndiGo plane for three hours when it landed in the western city of Pune on Wednesday night, with the pilot citing operational issues and the lack of permission to dock the plane until other planes had flown. The debacle is a major setback for a two-decade-old airline that has more than 2,000 flights daily and a fleet of more than 400 planes, mostly Airbus A320s. The airline has prided itself on its lack of delays, and its staff will often announce ""IndiGo Standard Time"" when boarding has been completed before schedule, a play on ""Indian Standard Time."" It remains to be seen just how badly the rostering woes will affect IndiGo, which garnered $9 billion in revenue in the past business year. Its biggest rival, Air India, has its own troubles, grappling with much scrutiny following a June crash that killed 260 people. At airports, frazzled and furious passengers stood in long queues inside crowded terminals as they tried to gather details about their flights. Ram Shankar Yadav, who was travelling with family to attend his younger brother's wedding celebrations, told Reuters that his flight had been delayed for six hours. ""We don't have enough chairs. People are taking newspapers to sit on the floor,"" Yadav told Reuters by telephone from the airport in Pune. ""People are angry.

Supporters of HB 93 talk of accountability,"MOSCOW— Concerns about accountability arose during a Wednesday town hall meeting in Moscow regarding Idaho’s new tax credit subsidizing private education. Mountain States Policy Center hosted the meeting in the 1912 Center to educate people about the $5,000 tax credit for families to cover costs associated with nonpublic schooling, including homeschooling. The tax credit was created when the Idaho Legislature passed House Bill 93 this year, which allocates $50 million in state money to reimburse families for these expenses. Mountain States Policy Center (MSPC) is a nonprofit that labels itself as a “free-market think tank” and is a supporter of HB 93. After explaining the rules and deadlines associated with the tax credit, which Idaho residents can apply for starting Jan. 15, MSPC President Chris Cargill answered questions regarding accountability within the program. The tax credit goes to families and not the schools, so there is nothing in HB 93 that says schools have to perform at certain standards, Cargill said. However, families that receive the tax credit must document their child’s educational growth using a “portfolio of evidence” if that child is not attending an accredited school, he said. This portfolio must show progress in science, math, social studies, English and language arts. A transcript from a private school counts toward this portfolio, but it is less clear how education growth is measured for homeschooled children. Cargill did say that the state’s Legislative Services Office will send out a survey to families who participate in the tax credit program to determine what kind of value the program is offering. Cargill reiterated during the town hall that parents who do not use the tax credit for its intended purpose are at risk of being audited and facing tax fraud charges. Families must provide receipts showing their expenses. Homeschooling parents cannot use the tax credit to pay themselves, he said. “You cannot just take this money and go on a trip to Hawaii with it,” he said. Cargill said approximately 8,000 students will be able to participate in the $50 million program. He said only Idaho residents can participate, and their child cannot be enrolled in a public school. HB 93 has been a controversial issue that has drawn criticism from public school advocates who fear this will drive taxpayer dollars away from public schools. Many people at Wednesday’s meeting expressed this concern. Moscow School District is one of nine petitioners involved in a lawsuit to prohibit HB 93. The lawsuit claims the tax credit program violates the state constitution, which says the Idaho Legislature must “establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.” Cargill argued that the amount of money being allocated toward the tax credit is relatively small compared to the money spent on public K-12 education. He said the tax credit and public education money are separate line items in the budget. When asked how Idaho can afford a program like this when it is facing a $58 million budget deficit, Cargill said Idaho is seeing increases in tax revenue but a decrease in federal funding. The tax credit program operates on a first-come first-served basis. However, it is supposed to prioritize families whose modified adjusted gross income does not exceed 300% of the federal poverty level.

“We’ll Influence the Match Like Allegri” – Lazio Ultras Prepare ‘Hellish’ Atmosphere for AC Milan,"The Lazio ultras have promised to create a deafening atmosphere at the Stadio Olimpico when receiving AC Milan in the Coppa Italia Round of 16. The two sides met five days earlier in Serie A showdown at San Siro, which was decided by Rafael Leao’s solitary strike. Although it wasn’t their best performance, the Biancocelesti are still infuriated by the refereeing, as Giuseppe Collu refused to heed the VAR’s advice and award Lazio a spot-kick for a handball on Strahinja Pavlovic, instead making up a non-existent foul on Adam Marusic. Collu’s decision was preceded by a spat with Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri, who lashed out at the match official before receiving his marching orders. Many felt that the former Juventus manager had done it on purpose to pile pressure on the referee. This is why Maurizio Sarri suggested that the VAR monitor should be moved to the opposite side of the dugouts. While Sarri only aimed a subtle dig at his fellow Tuscan manager, the Curva Nord supporters were more explicit in their accusations. Ahead of Thursday’s clash at the Stadio Olimpico, the Lazio ultras released a statement (via Il Messaggero), vowing to create a hellish atmosphere, as they aim to ‘influence’ the match, as Allegri did at San Siro. After everything that’s happened, you already know what to do. If you want to reach the quarterfinals, you’ll go there with your eardrums destroyed. The Lazio fans will take care of Lazio. Welcome to hell. We have to influence the outcome of the match like Allegri influenced the referee. While Milan currently sit at the top of the Serie A table, Lazio trail behind the European spots in eighth place. Hence, the Coppa Italia might represent their most viable track towards European football next season.",2025-12-04 08:04:00,Yahoo!

"As President of Nigeria, I won’t appoint past INEC chair as ambassador – Atiku","Atiku, who contested the 2023 presidential election under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said the decision raises “serious concerns” and risks being interpreted as a political reward rather than a merit-based appointment. “Let me state without ambiguity: under no circumstance would I, as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, nominate the immediate past INEC Chairman for an ambassadorial position,” Atiku wrote in a post on his X account on Thursday. He argued that the nomination “presents terrible optics for an administration already struggling with credibility,” adding that it sends the wrong message to the electoral body. “It risks appearing as a quid pro quo rather than a recognition of merit. It sends the wrong message to the current @inecnigeria leadership; that partisan, compromised, or poorly executed elections may ultimately be rewarded,” he said. Atiku added that it was “morally indefensible” for an electoral umpire at the centre of one of Nigeria’s most disputed elections to become a beneficiary of its outcome. “This is not the path to strengthening our democracy or restoring public trust in our institutions,” he said.

Blockbuster Dodgers Trade Idea Would Break Baseball,"Contributing Sports Writer The Los Angeles Dodgers have established themselves as one of the most aggressive teams in baseball. They have spent big in the last two offseasons and have won back-to-back World Series. The Dodgers have shown no reason to believe they will not be aggressive this offseason. Many insiders expect them to enter the Kyle Tucker sweepstakes and fill the few holes on their team with star players. Their starting rotation is stacked already, but could they be in play for Tarik Skubal? With the winter meeting starting, Skubal will be a hot name in rumors. He and the Detroit Tigers are reportedly far apart in contract negotiations as he enters his final season before free agency. Skubal could look to become the highest-paid pitcher in baseball after two Cy Young Award-winning seasons. It would require a contract that would be the biggest in franchise history for the Tigers. Although a trade of Skubal may be unlikely, the Tigers may be wise to deal their ace if they know they have no chance of keeping him past next season. FanSided's Christopher Kline proposed this trade that would send Skubal to the Los Angeles Dodgers: This package may be an underpay for SKubal, but the reality is that right now, he is nothing more than a rental. The Dodgers have the ability to pay him, something the Tigers have not proven to have. Skubal is arguably the best pitcher in baseball, and the Dodgers would add him to a rotation that already has Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow, Blake Snell and Rōki Sasaki. The Dodgers have been said to be ""ruining baseball"" with their spending habits. However, if fans were upset before, they would be outraged if the Dodgers added SKubal as they go for a three-peat. Sheehan is a solid pitcher and had a 2.82 ERA last year. Hope and Freeland are two of the Dodgers' best prospects, and Freeland could start right away. Meanwhile, Ryan was once one of the Dodgers' best prospects, but he is not going to take a rotation spot from one of the Dodgers' All-Star pitchers. In reality, it will take a phenomenal package to land Skubal. He has noted he wants to stay in Detroit, but the team will have to spend at an unprecedented level to keep him around.

"Klein hiring announcement coming Friday, public appearance Saturday","Kansas State offensive coordinator Collin Klein speaks to the media following practice Monday, Aug. 15, 2022. Collin Klein will be introduced as the new K-State football coach at a public event Friday, and he'll appear Saturday afternoon at the men’s basketball game at Bramlage Coliseum. The Mercury learned from sources close to the situation that, while the exact logistics were still getting worked out Thursday, the basic plan is set. Klein, who’s currently in College Station to coach Texas A&M into the college football playoffs, will be in Manhattan Friday and Saturday. No details are yet available about a contract, although it’s expected to be in the $4 million range. Chris Klieman, the outgoing coach, was making $5.25 million. Klein was making $1.6 million as the offensive coordinator at A&M. There’s no buyout provision in his contract if he leaves to take a FBS head-coaching position. Friday’s announcement will include a press conference; Saturday’s event — at K-State’s game against Seton Hall — is intended to be a chance to introduce the new coach to fans. Klein, 36, is widely regarded as a returning hero, having been a championship quarterback here in 2011-12. He played for Bill Snyder and coached under both Snyder and Kleiman. His stint as offensive coordinator included a Big 12 Championship in 2022. This year, A&M is one of the top-ranked teams in the country. But this would be his first head-coaching job at any level. K-State Athletics Director Gene Taylor said Wednesday that he had not yet talked to Klein, even though multiple sources told The Mercury that a deal had already been made. Taylor could make such a claim because he had in fact not talked to Klein — but had in fact made the deal happen by way of agents. The Mercury Wednesday morning first reported Klieman’s retirement and the hiring of Klein to replace him. Mutiple media outlets both in Kansas and Texas followed suit, and both Klieman and Taylor held a press conference later that day as a result. We're always interested in hearing about news in our community. Let us know what's going on!

Moscow parade lights up the sky,"MOSCOW — The wintry slush on the ground did not stop thousands of people from ringing in the holiday season Thursday night in Moscow. The city’s annual “Light up the Season” parade and tree lighting took place on Main Street and lit up the December sky. As is tradition, the event kicked off with a countdown to the lighting of a more than 20-foot tall tree towering over Friendship Square. The tree comes from Hash Tree Company in Princeton, according to Moscow City Administrator Bill Belknap. People also arrived decorated in their own holiday lights, from their festive sweaters to light-up necklaces and hats. Moscow High School cheerleaders with holiday lights on their pom-poms marched down the street. They were followed by a series of creative floats with themes like “The Nightmare Before Christmas” and the “Island of Misfit Toys.” The Grinch was prowling around Main Street in a Christmas sweater, but he was more interested in giving out high-fives than stealing presents. The road was not icy, but if it was, two of the parade participants would have been prepared — Moscow Title Inc. and Wholesale Hydraulics drove down Main Street in Zambonis. The star of the show was saved for the end of the parade. Santa Clause rode down the street in a horse carriage, presumably so his reindeer could save their energy for their big day later this month. While snow and rain fell on Moscow throughout the day, the precipitation ended just in time for the festive event.

Little-known button combination can easily clear fog in 10 seconds,"If you climb into your motor in the morning and discover a foggy windscreen, it can be incredibly irritating - particularly when you're rushing to get somewhere important. Whether it's work starting in 30 minutes, or you need to get the children to school, there's nothing quite like that sinking feeling when confronted with a windscreen which is impossible to drive with. After all, nobody fancies forking out for a fine and points on their licence, do they? However, were you aware there's a lesser-known button sequence in your vehicle that can accelerate the entire process and get you moving more quickly? When you're ""driving in the rain,"" it's remarkably simple to ""fog up your windshield,"" according to @chegeceping, who frequently shares automotive content on TikTok. He observed this can ""affect your vision"" and ""driving can be very dangerous,"" so you must resolve the issue before embarking on your journey. Additionally, it's advisable not to ""wipe it with your hands"" because you ""can't make it clean"" that way, so it's better to employ this button sequence instead. ""Today I'll tell you a trick. It only takes 10 seconds to remove the fog,"" he assured viewers. He went on: ""Just turn on this AC button, turn on the external circulation, and at the same time, adjust the air blowing mode to glass blowing mode. ""After a while, the fog on the glass will disappear. At the same time, turn on this square. It is the rear glass defogging switch."" He explained that by following these straightforward steps each time, you'll be able to clear your car's fogged windows rapidly and repeatedly without any hassle. In the comments section, one user noted you would ""get very cold,"" but it's worth enduring those brief moments of discomfort to guarantee safe driving conditions. The RAC states that driving with an unclear windscreen is against the law. The motoring organisation echoes similar guidance to the TikToker, advising: ""If your car has air conditioning, make sure it is switched on."" They elaborate: ""Use the air-con in conjunction with the heater. Hot air will dry the glass a little through evaporation, but the air will then cool down and condense on the glass once more, so make sure the air-con is on to keep the atmosphere inside dry."" The RAC continues: ""If your windscreen is iced over, then the heat is obviously more necessary. But in this instance, you might want to scrape the outside of your windscreen clear first."" They also revealed a clever trick to stop your windscreen from steaming up initially, suggesting you clean ""your windscreen with shaving foam"". The organisation explains: ""This protective barrier won't last forever and may need to be repeated regularly, but a windscreen cleaned with shaving foam will be less likely to mist up."" The RAC also mentioned that ice hockey players use this same technique to prevent their masks from fogging up during matches on the rink.

"Frank Gehry, the most celebrated architect of his time, dies at 96","Groundbreaking architect Frank Gehry who was behind the acclaimed Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, and Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles has died LOS ANGELES -- Frank Gehry, the most celebrated architect of his time, has died. He was 96. Gehry died Friday in his home in Santa Monica after a brief respiratory illness, said Meaghan Lloyd, chief of staff at Gehry Partners LLP.

Holy Angels faithful share joy of the season,"Keeping alive a tradition carried on through generations in the community, nearly a dozen volunteers on Monday night decorated Holy Angels Catholic Church in Roselle for the Christmas season. The wreaths, trees, garland, candles, lights, poinsettia flower arrangements and more give the church a warm, joyful setting. The centerpiece is a large Nativity scene believed to have come from the original church building. The first Mass of Holy Angels Church was celebrated in 1874, and the first church was built in 1875. It was wood-frame, measuring 32-by-60-feet and was built in the shape of a cross. The current Gothic-style church with its landmark 145-foot steeple was built in 1904. The church was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2019. Many items donated by families in memory of loved ones are incorporated into the decorations. Helping with the decorating Monday night were Tom and Pat (Eich) Simons, both lifelong Holy Angels members. “There’s a lot of history in the area,” Pat said. “There are a lot of Century Farms in the area. A lot of our forefathers are the ones who built the church, so it’s nice to carry on that history, that tradition. We have a lot of pride in the church.” Visitors are welcome to visit the church to view the decorations and its many other historic features — statues, cloth murals and more. The church is open from about 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. Arrangements also can be made by contacting Simons at 712-830-8592 or Marilyn (Rupiper) Dopheide, another lifelong member, at 712-790-1309. Simons said Christmas season is a popular time to visit the church, but there are visitors year-round. “It’s kind of surprising how many people go around and go through the old churches,” she said, noting Carroll County has a number of historic churches. “A lot of people just like to see the old churches and some of the Gothic architecture in them,” she observed. Many people take time to reflect, it’s there private time to talk to God, she said. Holy Angels this year will host a Christmas Eve Mass at 6 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 24. Holy Angels no longer has weekly Masses after it was changed to church building status in the Diocese of Sioux City’s merger of parishes in western Carroll County under the name of Good Shepherd Parish. The church still can be used for weddings, baptisms, funerals and special anniversaries. Also keeping the church active, Scripture readings and rosaries are held there Wednesday mornings at 8:30 and Saturday evenings at 5. Executive Editor Log In Keep it Clean.

"Following grandmother's example, Katie Pierson leads distribution of outerwear, other support through Lakes Region Santa Fund","The Lakes Region Santa Fund helps children in need with outerwear, scholarships for classes and camps, and also assistance in the case of emergencies. (Courtesy photo) For more than 50 years, the Lakes Region Santa Fund has been helping local children and families in a variety of ways, and Chair Katie Pierson said this year, the need is as great as ever. The Santa Fund's mission is to support children in need, and while outerwear tends to be the focus of the fall and winter months, the nonprofit organization also helps provide scholarships for camps and classes, as well as emergency funding for families facing crisis situations. “We have served about 540 kids so far this year, and we still have some trickling orders coming in, which is common,” Pierson said. The Lakes Region Santa Fund has a 12-member board that works to help the area’s youth. Pierson said the busy season starts in the fall, when the distribution of outerwear begins, and the organization works with school nurses, counselors, and other nonprofits to make sure nobody slips through the cracks. “We don’t just stop because Christmas and the cold season is over,” Pierson said. “This is an all-year effort.” The board members meet once a week at the end of October and through November, and go over the names of the children in need of their help. The Santa Fund helps children in 20 schools throughout six school districts, and normally, they assist between 500 and 600 people. Pierson said this equates to about 275 families across the Lakes Region. “Our scheduled distribution is only about four weeks, but we will fill orders any time on an as-needed basis,” Pierson said. “Unless it is an emergency, distribution of outerwear is usually over in January. Then, we start looking for clearance items, to make our money go as far as possible.” Board members shop around for sales in the area in February, preparing for the next season. But between seasons, assistance doesn’t stop, and instead the gears shift to other ways to help. “We will start doing scholarships, and maybe there will be money for someone to take a class at a community college,” she said. “Or flute lessons, and they need money for an instrument, or maybe money for books for a college program.” The Santa Fund helps with vouchers for emergency funding, for things like groceries and even gas money, if someone had a child being treated in a faraway hospital, for example. “We are fortunate to get donations and are able to go the extra mile, and not just for outerwear,” Pierson said. Years back, the Santa Fund worked out of the basement of the Foley Oil building. In the pre-COVID years, families would come to them to pick up outerwear, but now, items are delivered to schools. The organization now operates out of the Belknap County Sportsmen’s Club in Gilford, where they have the outerwear hung up and ready to go. “This way has kept us much more organized,” Pierson said. “There was one year we had a line down Garfield Street. It’s much easier to do the three-day process, rather than everyone coming to us.” During peak distribution time, the Santa Fund receives forms by emails from school staff about students who need help. On Mondays, they gather the information, Tuesday the orders are filled, and then deliveries are made on Wednesdays. Pierson said new winter jackets are provided for children of all ages, and they also distribute snowpants and winter boots for elementary school students to use for recess. Pierson said the Santa Fund is fortunate school staff see its value, and are willing and ready to work with them on filling needs. She said social workers and counselors are vital, and they couldn’t do it without them. “We are very grateful for the help of the schools."" The Santa Fund receives most of its funding from the Greater Lakes Region Children’s Auction, and Pierson said they will have board members and volunteers answering phones for the Tuesday, Dec. 9, start of the annual fundraising event. “They have been giving to us forever, so we couldn’t do this without them, for sure,” Pierson said. “We try to give back whenever we can for them. They’re a great resource for our community and not just for us. They help so many kids in need.” The Santa Fund originated as a toy drive under the name “Citizen Santa Fund.” Pierson remembers helping her grandmother Louise Killourhy as a child, when her grandmother ran the program in the mid-1970s. Pierson left the area for some time, and 12 years ago she returned to find the Santa Fund was still around, and had evolved. She said everything has come full circle. “When I moved back, I heard the Santa Fund was still an active program,” she said. “So, I thought, 'You know what? I’ll give a donation,' and I included a booklet about my history with the fund.” The next thing Pierson knew, she was offered a position on the board of directors, and became the co-chair two years in. For the past four years she has served as the sole chair, and said it is so rewarding to be a source of assistance for those who are struggling financially. Now retired, Pierson said she has much more time to put in to help those in need. It’s a busy time of year for everyone, and she admits she can get frustrated or tired, but at the end of the day, helping these children and families means the world to her. “This whole board, as you can imagine, they are all givers,” she said. “To be in that atmosphere of people is just amazing.” Pierson said they are still receiving applications, noting one was filled just this week. The Santa Fund also just helped a family in Meredith affected by a fire, to make sure they all had warm clothing. “When there is a need, we will be there to fill it,” Pierson said.

Providers: Expensive changes due in mental health care,"Health care providers say budget cuts that went into effect Monday to programs serving people in crisis and those with severe mental health disorders could end up costing the state upward of $150 million in the first year, and add financial and staffing burdens to local governments, mental health care providers and law enforcement. The cost A report by the Idaho Association of Community Providers and the Idaho ACT Coalition said the cuts to those programs, which total roughly $20 million, could cost some $150 million in other areas through the increased utilization of emergency services, law enforcement, involuntary psychiatric holds, child welfare programs, and other costs such as homeless encampments. The program cuts included the elimination of Assertive Community Treatment, or ACT; in-home residential treatment and Partial Hospitalization Programs; Early Serious Mental Illness teams; and peer support programs. “ By the time you calculate increases in predictable (state program) usage, hospital usage,” said Ric Boyce, co-director of the Idaho Association of Community Providers, “that’s gonna cost $150 million to $180 million on the very conservative end.” In Region 2, which includes Nez Perce, Latah, Clearwater, Lewis and Idaho counties, IACP predicts the cuts could result in $12 million to $16 million in costs to local governments per year. Those cuts are part of a 4% reduction for Medicaid provider pay rates, part of an effort to shore up the state’s budget shortfall estimated to be $58.3 million, according to the Idaho Capital Sun. That shortfall includes a revenue loss of $253 million in tax cuts that largely benefit Idaho’s wealthiest residents, according to the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy, as well as the added cost of $675,000 in tax credits to reimburse families for nonpublic education. Local impact Sara Bennett is the owner of Riverside Recovery, which has offices in Lewiston and Orofino. For more than a year, her team administered the regional ACT program. Previously, ACT was administered by the state directly. ACT programs are designed to offer behavioral health support for people with severe mental illness where traditional mental health services haven’t worked, Bennett said. They’ve been shown to significantly reduce hospitalization. Patients include people with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, as well as people with severe bipolar disorder and major depression. “ACT is that kind of aggressive outreach,” she said. “Helping engage that individual in the community or in the setting that they’re in, and helping them stabilize within that environment.” Until Monday, Bennett and her team served about 42 people in the region through ACT. Statewide, the program served around 400 individuals. But this week, those patients are no longer receiving the treatment they’re used to. The budget cuts, which providers were told would “unbundle” services previously funded as a package, effectively eliminates the program, Bennett said. For instance, the ACT team worked with a nurse who could administer injectable medication. “With what they call ‘unbundling’ of ACT, nursing isn’t even a billable service,” Bennett said. She said her staff are trying to connect those individuals to traditional mental health services. Now they’re being forced to work within a system they know is less effective. Bennett said patients, some of whom have relied on ACT for over 20 years, are worried. “This is the lifeline that they know has kept them well,” she said. “They’re very scared and worried about what that’s gonna look like for them and how they’re gonna get the support if they’re struggling.” Boyce said he anticipates as many as half of the roughly 400 patients statewide who were served by ACT may drop off in the transition to outpatient mental health counseling. “These are people who can barely answer their door consistently to us,” he said. “Realistically, these (unbundled services) are not the appropriate services. They’re not the evidence-based services that will keep those individuals out of hospitals, out of jails, out of homelessness.” Tom Lamar, Latah County commissioner and vice chairperson of the Region 2 Behavioral Health Board, said he’s expecting more of a burden on local crisis and recovery centers, mental health providers, nonprofits and law enforcement. Lamar said that in cutting services bundled under Medicare, the state Legislature shifted the responsibility and cost to local programs. “They really need to develop a more mature view of the costs of providing services at the state and local levels,” Lamar said. “Counties are a subdivision of the state of Idaho, according to the (state) constitution. And they don’t act like it.” In a letter sent to Gov. Brad Little and state lawmakers on Dec. 1, the Idaho Sheriffs’ Association wrote that elimination of services would cause an increase in call volumes, involuntary holds, incarceration, civil and criminal court cases, and negative outcomes for community members. “County sheriffs’ offices, especially rural agencies, already operate with thin margins,” the letter said. “The loss of these stabilization programs will not reduce the overall cost to the State of Idaho. Instead, it will shift those costs directly onto county budgets, jails, E.M.S. agencies, and local taxpayers.” In Region 2, the Nez Perce county jail would likely see an increase of inmates from both inside and outside of county lines. Latah County in June transitioned its jail to a court holding and booking facility after an assessment found the need for extensive updates. “Our inmates have been transferred, mostly, to Nez Perce County,” Lamar said. Boyce said it’s an especially big risk for people with acute mental health disorders like severe bipolar and schizophrenia. “When people come off of medications who have those acute mental illnesses, things become unpredictable very quickly,” he said. Bennett said she hopes legislators will add those programs back next year, ensconced in state law. “These are the individuals with the highest needs, and this is the only evidence-based treatment that we offer,” she said. The Region 2 Behavioral Health Board will meet Thursday with plans to talk to local legislators and their representatives. Sun may be contacted at rsun@lmtribune.com or on X @Rachel_M_Sun.

Rogers leaving Washington State for Iowa State after one year in Pullman,"After just one year, the Jimmy Rogers era at Washington State is over. Rogers is set to become Iowa State’s head football coach, the school announced Friday night. ESPN’s Pete Thamel first reported the news. Washington State went 6-6 in Rogers’ first year in Pullman — a bizarre transition year in which WSU had 75 new players, played schools from 10 different conferences ahead of the Pac-12’s expansion in 2026 and lost three road games to AP Top 25 opponents by a combined margin of 12 points. Defensive coordinator Jesse Bobbit, who also worked with Rogers at South Dakota State, will serve as the Cougars’ interim head coach, according to a source familiar with the situation. WSU is set to learn which bowl game it will play in on Sunday and will apparently prepare for the game without its head coach for a second straight year. Former WSU coach Jake Dickert left for Wake Forest about 10 days prior to WSU’s bowl game last year. Iowa State’s former coach Matt Campbell, the winningest coach in ISU history, is set to take the same position at Penn State, according to reports, which cleared the way for Rogers to ascend from FCS coach at South Dakota State to a Big 12 program leader — with an 11-month stop in Pullman — in less than one calendar year. “Iowa State has been one of the nation’s top programs for the last decade and we look forward to building upon its upward trajectory,” Rogers said in an ISU statement. “From the administration, to the alumni and current student-athletes, this university has everything needed to compete at the highest level in college football. I am honored to be given this opportunity and responsibility and cannot wait to get started.” Rogers agreed to a six-year deal with Iowa State. Terms of the deal were not immediately available. WSU hired Rogers on Dec. 28, 2024, the day after the Cougars lost the DirecTV Holiday Bowl game to Syracuse in San Diego. The deal that Rogers agreed to last year gave him $1.57 million per year through 2029. Now, WSU will seek to replace Rogers without a permanent athletic director. Last month, the university fired athletic director Anne McCoy after just 17 months on the job and named CFO Jon Haarlow as interim AD. The value of Rogers’ buyout was not immediately clear as of Friday night. Rogers has spent the majority of his football coaching career at his alma mater, South Dakota State, where he won two FCS national championships — one as defensive coordinator in 2022 and another in his first year as head coach in 2023. He was 27-3 in two seasons as the Jackrabbits’ head coach and will arrive in Ames, Iowa, with a 33-9 combined head coaching record over the past three years. Rogers brought the bulk of his assistant coaches with him from Brookings, S.D., to Pullman, including both coordinators and a slew of position coaches and staff members. He also welcomed 16 of his former South Dakota State players to WSU through the transfer portal and flipped a slew of players from his 2025 SDSU high school recruitment class. Seven of WSU’s eight leading tacklers, including starting safety Tucker Large and linebacker Caleb Francl, were either SDSU players or recruits. Under Rogers’ direction and Bobbit’s coordination, WSU was No. 18 in total defense per Pro Football Focus, with 303 yards allowed per game against one of the tougher schedules in the country. His staff took a unique shape from the get-go, with a youthful and innovative flavor. The staff included Kris Kracht, director of football mental performance. Rogers separated himself from his smiley predecessor with a distinctly stoic style. He prided himself on “telling the truth,” and his players — from those who stayed at WSU to those who followed him from Brookings, S.D., to those who transferred from elsewhere — praised him for that. “I’m about people and I’m about as loyal as it gets,” Rogers said in his introductory news conference in the Gesa Field suite in January. “I know that word has been thrown around here and people don’t want to hear it.” WSU welcomed 28 new players — 25 of them high school recruits — on Wednesday at the start of college football’s early signing period. In a Wednesday news conference, he detailed his approach to recruitment. “As you get to know him, you get to realize, ‘Are they a man of their word? Do they follow through? How do they treat people? Are they selfless? Do people in the school speak highly of them?’” Rogers said. “Because those things carry over to the football field, there’s no question about it.” Player reaction to the news was mostly optimistic on social media. Defensive ends Jack Janikowski and Donovan Fitzmaurice shared the same Bible verse on their Instagram stories, Proverbs 16:3: “Ask the Lord to bless your plans and you will be successful in carrying them out.” Tight end Trey Leckner, another Coug who endured Dickert’s pre-bowl game departure last year, posted “God got all us covered !! Trusting his plan,” on X (formerly Twitter). “Know that!” redshirt freshman linebacker Anthony Palano replied. Palano was one of 16 players to follow Rogers and his staff from SDSU to WSU. He earned a starting role at middle linebacker after Keith Brown missed the season with an injury and shared the spot with true freshman Sullivan Schlimgen. Since news of Rogers’ departure broke, no player has publicly announced plans to transfer, though that is likely to change. Three Cougars — including Potter and redshirt freshman cornerback Kenny Worthy III — are reportedly intending to enter the transfer portal. Worthy announced his intentions on his Instagram on Thursday. WSU has not released any public comment concerning Rogers’ departure as of press time.

‘Didn’t really feel fair’: Pat Cummins makes key reveal over ‘close’ Gabba selection call,"Australian skipper Pat Cummins has declared his fitness for the Adelaide Test, revealing the team’s ultimate reason for precaution in Brisbane. The Aussies flirted with recalling the 32-year-old after a brisk recovery from his back injury, but Cummins spoke of not wanting to be “too cute” with team balance when it came to managing bowling loads. Speaking during the second session on Day 3, Cummins confirmed on Fox Cricket that “barring any hiccups”, he’d make a return at Adelaide Oval on December 17. Watch The Ashes 2025/26 LIVE and ad-break free during play with FOX CRICKET on Kayo Sports | New to Kayo? Join now and get your first month for just $1 > “First of all, yeah, I should be right for Adelaide,” he said on Fox Cricket. “So, I’ll have one more bowl tomorrow (Sunday), and then we’ll go to Adelaide and have another bowl there. “So, barring any hiccups, I’ll be good to go. Body feels great.” Asked by commentator Mark Howard how close he was to playing in Brisbane, Cummins said: “Relatively close, really. “Body feels great, I’m bowling at 100 per cent. The big question mark when coming back from a bone injury is we tend to have a bowl and have a couple of days off, recover, bowl, bowl. “I haven’t done back-to-back bowls, so one of the high-risk things going into a Test match is you’re going to be expected to bowl two days in a row, maybe three days in a row, and potentially quite a few overs.” The Australian skipper revealed the deciding factor in not making an earlier return. “So, we felt that (not doing back-to-back bowls yet) was too risky; we started to kind of game plan (for reduced overs) — could we try and maybe bowl 20 overs, 25 overs with ‘Greeny’ in the side as an all-rounder?” Cummins continued. “We feel like we’ve got lots of bowling. So, we really tried to map out a way where I could play, but it just felt a little bit too cute in the end. “And it didn’t really feel fair on the other bowlers, or even on myself as a captain. If I had to have a bowler that I was bowling and trying to work out which overs, it didn’t quite feel right … it didn’t feel like the right Test match to take that risk.” Cummins reinforced the Gabba’s seam-friendly surface, speaking similarly to Steve Smith ahead of the first day of the second Test when speaking on conditions. “One of the reasons you want to win the toss and have a bat is it gives you the chance to hopefully bowl in the night with a rock-hard ball, and maybe you can really pick and choose for the rest of the game where you can place your new-ball bowling to line it up with night-time,” he said. Cummins later added: “It also feels, as a bowler, and I’m not sure if the data backs this up, but it swings a bit more here in Brisbane, whether it’s more humid conditions than Adelaide.”",2025-12-06 08:04:00,Fox Sports,positive,0.4684,68,Overs_Ball_Sports, Pat Cummins has declared his fitness for the Adelaide Test .

(@Kelowna_Rockets/X) The massive third period is just what the doctor ordered as the Kelowna Rockets opened its seven-game road trip with a 5-3 win over the Seattle Thunderbirds on Friday, Dec. 5. After a scoreless first period, Seattle’s Antonio Martorana opened the scoring with his 15th goal of the season at the 4:58 mark of the second frame.

Clever reason Royal Mail workers always wear shorts even in winter,"Forget how cold the UK is right now, our Royal Mail workers are still wearing shorts! Regardless of the weather conditions, you'll find posties just love dressing like it's still summer, but it turns out there's an explanation to it all. Following a query on Reddit, somebody questioned whether it was an official regulation or silly tradition handed down through time. As it happens, the reasoning is quite straightforward – and rather clever. The post asked: ""Postmen/woman of the UK, why do you wear shorts all year round?"" Whilst another post posed the identical question. So what's the reason behind it? Thankfully, the queries encouraged Royal Mail workers to respond, revealing it's a combination of getting hot on the job and a little bet. One stated: ""It really is just because it gets hot doing the job. One round I wear trousers just because of the wind but it's that particular village happens to be the highest point of the town and is a massive wind tunnel. All other rounds I'm in shorts pretty much all year."" Another in the profession commented: ""The depot had a running bet where everyone paid £1 a week into a pot, with the winner got to give the entire fund to a charity of their choice. ""The competition was to see who could go furthest into the winter in shorts. As the snow kicked in during January it was down to two die hards. Eventually as spring kicked in it was deemed a tie, the pot was split between the two, raising several hundred each. ""At the end of the competition a supervisor also added to the pot out of his own pocket and both got a free cooked breakfast from the work's canteen for a week in recognition of their efforts!"" A third individual confessed: ""Skin is waterproof. Walking all day is hot work."" In another comment, a user claimed: ""Skin dries faster than trousers when it rains, they get in and out the van a lot and at my father-in-law's post office depot, anyone that doesn't show up in shorts has to put a quid in the jar."" One Reddit user wrote: ""Same reason footballers are still wearing shorts playing in freezing rain. Once you're burning a certain number of calories you don't feel the weather at all."" Speaking about posties, one person remarked: ""Seen a few today in shorts. I admire their stealth."" However, it's believed that in severe conditions some delivery workers do resort to wearing waterproof trousers. So next time you spot your postie strolling around in shorts in the freezing cold, just know they've had a busy day!",2025-12-06 08:04:00,Liverpool Echo,positive,0.5682,46,Posties_More_Just," Reddit user asked Royal Mail workers why they wear shorts all year round .

When a cluster of bees counts as central heating,"The first seriously cold week of the season and here I am shivering in my backroom office and paying first-of-the-month bills. In spite of the chill, it’s kind of nice to do these regular tasks, like paying bills and changing the calendar to the last month of the year. It’s been a year and a half since I retired and I have found that it’s easy to slip into the kind of relaxed mode I was in when I was a teenager — meaning, things get done if and when they get done. That’s the whole purpose of becoming an adult: You start cleaning up your act and becoming responsible so you can hold down a job, raise a family and make enough money to begin therapy. I’m not a big fan of winter, but it does tend to focus one’s attention. Isn’t that what they also say about standing in front of a firing squad? Winter requires some forethought about how to keep warm, how to stay fed and how to prevent every pipe in your house from freezing into an icicle so you don’t have to call the plumber and try to bribe him into coming to your house to fix them, which is futile because all the other bozos who failed to winterize their house got to him first. I love that joke about the lawyer who hired the plumber to come to his house and when he got the bill, the lawyer exclaimed: “Geez, even I don’t make this much money!” and the plumber replies: “Neither did I, when I was a lawyer.” I tell this joke to my lawyer son and he doesn’t laugh. My sister, who is such a good gardener, came to help me clean up the backyard to get ready for winter and she noticed that there were a lot of dead bees in front of the hive on my back patio. It’s normal, I explained. Bees don’t live long, anyway, and in the winter some of them die and the ones inside the hive kick out the bodies. But even though it looks bad, dead bees in front of your hive are actually a good thing because it means there are still live bees inside. When you stop seeing dead bees on the ground that could be a sign of trouble, such as, they’re all dead inside. Winter is the time all of us beekeepers wring our hands in hopes that the colonies will get through the winter. Beekeepers take pains to winterize their hives just as homeowners do to their houses, although you don’t have to worry about frozen pipes in a bee hive. Bees don’t hibernate but they do form a tight cluster in the center of the hive box and rotate from the inside to the outside of the cluster to stay warm. I’ve read that the inside of a honey bee hive stays around 98 degrees in the winter, which is pretty amazing considering there’s no wood stove. Although I suppose you could consider that cluster of bees central heating. And there’s a lesson in that, of course. We all stay warmer when we stick together. Honey bees survive by eating the honey they’ve stored up over the past year. Many beekeepers augment their bees’ food by providing candy boards or some other form of sugar in case the bees’ stores run low. I’ve never done that but I think it’s a sweet gesture to give bees candy over the holidays. And then comes spring when the bees emerge from their winter igloo and get busy collecting nectar and honey and resuming their vocation in life to make more honey. Which I collect later on in the summer and put into a jar and then when the cold winter comes back again, I spoon some out into a steaming hot cup of tea. It’s an exchange of gifts.

Arne Slot reaction — 'A sense of unbelief' from Liverpool manager after latest dropped points,"Arne Slot knows nothing's coming easy for Liverpool this season, and that's starting to feel proverbial after the Reds threw aside 2-0 and 3-2 leads in a 3-3 draw with Leeds at Elland Road on Saturday. That makes it two draws in four days against newly-promoted sides for the defending champions. Slot's men had been held into the second half, but Hugo Ekitike remedied that with two quick goals right after the break.

How did Slot see things? How do you feel? ""A sense of unbelief. I think we played quite well to very well in large parts of the game.

"Letter: As a community, let’s put books in children’s hands","To the editor, This year, I joined with the Community Foundation of Grand Forks, East Grand Forks and Region to bring Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library to Grand Forks County. This incredible program, which sends free books to children every month until their fifth birthday, echoes a value I learned on our family farm: Books are the foundation for a strong future. ADVERTISEMENT My dad, a stoic, Norwegian-blooded farmer, wasn’t much for conversation. But he knew a sure-fire way to connect with his daughter was through books. Many nights, when he wasn’t harvesting, he would read me stories, exploring the worlds of the Berenstain Bears and Richard Scarry. These moments with my dad allowed us to bond. They sparked my love of reading and showed me how characters navigated challenges with compassion. We have an opportunity to ensure every child in Grand Forks County can have those same moments, no matter their income. We can send them a book every month, straight to their home (from Niagara to Northwood), to spend their most formative years immersed in storytelling. We can develop the next generation of leaders who enter kindergarten with an enthusiasm for learning and an ability to connect. Regular access to books is crucial to building a child’s language, critical thinking and reading skills. In fact, research from the Dollywood Foundation finds 90% of brain development occurs in the first three years of life, when a baby forms over 1 million neural connections per second. Books can’t wait until kindergarten. The opportunity I had as a child is possible for all with Imagination Library. But we need the support of local partners to make it happen. We’ve set a goal of $90,000 to initiate Imagination Library, a goal we’ll need to sustain annually. It’s a large investment, but a necessary one. If you believe that books can change a life’s trajectory, please consider partnering with us to bring Imagination Library to Grand Forks County.

Soccer-Leipzig dismantle Frankfurt 6-0 with Diomande hat-trick,"Soccer Football - Bundesliga - RB Leipzig v Eintracht Frankfurt - Red Bull Arena, Leipzig, Germany - December 6, 2025 RB Leipzig's Yan Diomande celebrates scoring their third goal REUTERS/Lisi Niesner LEIPZIG, Germany, Dec 6 (Reuters) - RB Leipzig teenager Yan Diomande became the second youngest player in Bundesliga history to score a hat-trick when he netted three times in 18 minutes in their 6-0 demolition of visitors Eintracht Frankfurt 6-0 in the Bundesliga on Saturday as they tightened their hold on second spot in the Bundesliga. The 19-year-old Ivory Coast internationalbagged his goals between the 47th and 65th minutes to take his season tally to six league goals. Only Frankfurt’s Walter Bechtold was younger when he scored his hat-trick in November 1965. Conrad Harder put the hosts in the driving seat after five minutes, timing his run perfectly to head the ball over Eintracht keeper Michael Zetterer, who came charging out of his goal. Frankfurt hit the crossbar with Mo Dahoud's stunning shot from 20 metres out but Leipzig hit them on the rebound, immediately launching a quick break, with Harder cuttingback for Christoph Baumgartner to tap in their second goal after half an hour. Diomande then took over, scoring twice before David Raum made it 5-0 with a 62nd minute penalty. The teenager completed his maiden Bundesliga hat-trick with another superb finish three minutes later. Leipzig are on 29 points in second place, eight behind leaders Bayern Munich, winners 5-0 at VfB Stuttgart. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund, on 25, are in action against Hoffenheim on Sunday.

A Difficult First Year Due To Terror Attacks: CM Omar,"Date Srinagar- Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Saturday said his first year in office has been“a difficult one” owing to major terror attacks, while sharply questioning the Union Territory governance framework for sidelining the elected government in security matters.Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in New Delhi, Omar said those claiming terrorism had ended in the region were ignoring ground realities. He insisted there was no“return” of militancy because it had never fully vanished. “Why do you use the word return? When did it ever go away? It was there,” he said.“The changes made to the constitutional relationship between Jammu and Kashmir and the rest of India are not going to miraculously result in an end to terror.” The chief minister referred to the April 22 attack in Baisaran, Pahalgam and the November 10 blast in Delhi, saying those who believed everything was normal after 2019 were taken by surprise. Omar warned that the recent terror incidents have pushed the country to a point where any future strike“will be considered an act of war”, making preventive action even more critical. He criticised the existing governance model under Union Territory status, saying elected representatives are excluded from key security discussions.“You cannot operate governments in silos. Elected representatives play no part whatsoever in decisions affecting security,” he said. Omar drew a contrast with his earlier tenure as chief minister, when he received immediate updates from senior police and security officials.“I read about the Delhi blast in a newspaper. I did not know who carried out the attack or how the investigation was proceeding,” he remarked.“The Union Territory model does not work.” MENAFN06122025000215011059ID1110446826 MENAFN06122025000215011059ID1110446826 Legal Disclaimer: MENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

Tower of London closed after protesters attack crown jewel case,"By Natascha Rivera • Published: 06 Dec 2025 • 21:06 • 3 minutes read Activists smeared food on the Crown’s case, triggering arrests and disruption. Photo Credit: Take Back Power THE TOWER of London was swiftly closed to the public shortly before 10:00am on Saturday, December 6 after a glass case of one of the centrepieces of the attraction, the Imperial State Crown, was smeared with food by protesting activists. The four protesters, who claimed to be from the “nonviolent civil resistance” organisation Take Back Power, threw apple crumble and custard onto the glass display case, leading to their immediate arrest, according to the Metropolitan Police. Take Back Power claimed responsibility for the attack on its social media account, and released images on its social media showing activists removing foil from a tray of cake and throwing it against the glass case. Another protester poured what later turned out to be custard on the glass as well. “Democracy has crumbled. Billionaires buy political influence whilst homeless people die on the streets,” reads their Instagram post. “We need a House of the People to tax the rich.” Following the protest, activists were shown wearing t-shirts with the slogans “democracy has collapsed,” and “Britain is broken, we are standing before the jewels of the nation to retake power.” According to Take Back Power, which appears to be an offshoot of British environmental activist group Just Stop Oil, the aim of the incident was to demand that the British government create a permanent citizens’ channel with legislative power, a so-called “People’s House,” which aims to tax the extremely wealthy and fix the country’s social situation. According to the organisation, the country faces a crisis of democratic representation, hence their slogans. The protesters were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, according to a statement released by the Metropolitan Police, who collaborated with the City of London Police. The detainees remain in custody and an investigation into possible structural damage to the display case is ongoing. The Tower of London was evacuated and closed to the public to facilitate an assessment of the damage and cleanup of the food. The exhibition of the jewels will remain on pause until the assessment is complete. A possible link to other organised protests is also under investigation. The Tower of London, an emblematic fortress and historical heritage site of not only the city but the whole of the UK, houses several valuable pieces including the Crown Jewels. The Imperial State Crown, which was housed in the attacked case, was forged in 1937 for the coronation of George VI, and still remains a principal symbol of the United Kingdom, often used at events including King Charles III’s coronation in 2023. The Imperial State Crown is made of 2,868 diamonds, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, four rubies, and 269 pearls, and weighs more than one kilogram. It is preserved as part of the Royal Treasury, alongside various other pieces. The attack marks an unprecedented event and has sparked widespread concern about security protocols at one of the city’s most visited attractions. The incident was an unwelcome reminder of the recent large-scale security failure in France, the Louvre robbery in October of this year, in which thieves were able to enter the Louvre and steal €88 million worth of jewels, baffling and humiliating French authorities. Though the situations differ greatly in that the protesters had, as it is understood, no intent to steal any of the artifacts, the parallels are enough to make residents question whether security in an important national monument like the Tower of London is adequate. The Metropolitan Police did not rule out further measures to improve security at the site. Read more news from the UK here.

"At least 3 killed, 6 wounded in explosion in western Mexican state of Michoacan","07/12/2025 Share: Share Story MEXICO CITY, Dec 7, (AP): An explosion outside a local police station in the western Mexican state of Michoacan Saturday killed at least three people and wounded six, local and federal security officials said. The explosion came as the federal government has stepped up security activities in the state, sending in additional troops after two recent high-profile assassinations. The Attorney General's office said in a statement that a vehicle exploded on a central avenue in Coahuayana. ""The driver died at the scene, while two other people died in the regional hospital, and six others were injured,"" it said. The two people who died in the hospital were community police officers, said Hector Zepeda, commander of the Coahuayana community police. He said the remains of some of the victims were found scattered in the area of the explosion, which also damaged nearby buildings. ""With this operation (from the federal government) a lot of marines came,” Zepeda said. ""We stopped doing patrols because the operation is going on.” The community police, which patrol various rural communities, are a remnant of the civilian vigilante forces that took up arms more than a decade ago to defend communities from drug cartels, and then were formalized by the state. Coahuayana is near the Pacific coast in western Michoacan and the border with the state of Colima, a stronghold of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Saturday’s explosion happened while Michoacan Gov Alfredo Ramírez Bedolla was in Mexico City to celebrate with President Claudia Sheinbaum the anniversary of their Morena party’s arrival in power seven years ago. Ramírez Bedolla and Sheinbaum have been criticized for the deteriorating security situation in Michoacan where numerous drug cartels are fighting to control territory, terrorizing locals. At least three of the six drug cartels that the Trump administration designated as terrorist organizations - Jalisco New Generation, United Cartels and The New Michoacan Family - operate here, in addition to a slew of homegrown armed splinter groups, some supported by the Sinaloa Cartel. Explosives dropped from drones, buried as mines or planted alongside roadways are increasingly employed by criminal groups operating in the state. Last year, some 3,000 explosive devices were seized in the state compared to 160 in 2022. So far this year, there have been more than 2,000, according to the state security agency.

"Asking Eric: After 6 years sober, man is frustrated by his family’s hold on their hurt and distrust","Dear Eric: I’ve just turned 40 this past year. The last 15 years I was in a horrible drug addiction. I lied and hurt and did terrible things to a lot of people, especially my family. About eight years ago they officially disowned me. Understandable. I’ve cleaned up and got my act together six years ago. At first, I tried to force my way back into their lives, which all refuted. I lashed out, said horrible things and stopped trying to be in their lives. My mom will stop by on my birthday for 10 minutes or so and drop a card off at Christmas. As for my two older brothers and my father, it’s radio silence. I guess what I’m asking is, what do I do to fix this and fast, as I said I’ve turned 40 this year, my parents are both 70. Time is running out, and I couldn’t imagine living my life without some kind of acceptance from my father. Or knowing he did or does love me. My heart breaks at the thought, but this is a real pickle. How can I fix a problem when the ones I need to fix it with won’t talk to me? Do I just keep ignoring their existence and put on this façade that I don’t care to my wife and 4-year-old son? What picture am I painting to my son, as he’s been guilty by association you could say as he has never spent time with his grandparents or uncles or even my nieces and nephews? – Discombobulated Dear Discombobulated: There’s a saying in some recovery communities – perhaps you’ve heard it – time takes time. This means that you accumulate sober days one at a time; there’s no fast track to long-term recovery, unfortunately. Similarly, there is no fast track to healing years of hurt and distrust. This can be hard to accept. It may feel like you’re trapped in your old self and your old actions. But you have to accumulate days in your new way of life one at a time, too. If you’re in a recovery program, like Narcotics Anonymous or SMART Recovery, keep working it. Talk to your sponsor or peer support group about your desire to make amends to your relatives and mend those relationships. Ask yourself if you’ve fully acknowledged and apologized for the things that you did during active addiction. If not, a letter doing so is a good place to start. I know this causes you a lot of pain, and possibly shame. But you’re not your past and you’re not the worst things you’ve done. Let your wife know what you’re really feeling. Continuing to put up a façade will only hurt your relationship and could endanger your sobriety. Tell the truth. That’s how things change, little by little. Send questions to R.

'MobLand' season 2 faces off-screen rift between Helen Mirren and Tom Hardy,"December 07, 2025 MobLand season 2 is shaping up to be just as intense behind the scenes as it on the screen. According to insiders, the relationship between Dame Helen Mirren and Tom Hardy is ‘extremely strained’ on the set of Paramount+ show. Reportedly, Mirren who plays the sharp and commanding Maeve Harrigan is said to be frustrated with Hardy’s laid-back approach. Crew members have described him as occasionally distracted and even late to shoots. The 48-year-old is reportedly found at times playing games on his phone. Such behavior clashes with Mirren’s reputation for professionalism and discipline. A source shared the actress is ‘getting increasingly frustrated’ with attitude. As per an insider, “Tom’s character is charming. He’s the calm one but it is quite the opposite when the cameras stop. Dame Helen is a joy, she is a total pro and she has worked with so many people over the years.” “But she is getting increasingly frustrated with Tom and his attitude. He can be late to filming too and that is annoying for Dame Helen, who is extremely professional and disciplined.” “She expects better. She holds people to a high standard. She’s 80. She’s been there and seen it all,” the insider continued. The friction has made their working relationship difficult. Observers say Mirren no longer looks comfortable filming scenes with him, and the tension has become personal rather than purely professional. This isn’t the first time Hardy’s intensity has caused issues. During the filming of Mad Max: Fury Road too, he famously clashed with Charlize Theron.",2025-12-07 08:04:00,Geo Tv,negative,0.5689,5,Estate_Million_To, The relationship between Dame Helen Mirren and Tom Hardy is ‘extremely strained’ on the set of MobLand season 2 .

Lewiston’s ‘flying car’ has vanished — but will return,"The classic car that spent 25 years perched on a pole outside of Wayback Cafe in Lewiston has vanished in seemingly mysterious fashion. But it will be back. The car, a 1954 Chevrolet 150 sedan that is painted blue with distinctive pink flames, was purchased recently by Lori and Kevin Williams, of Deer Park. In late October, the couple and some of their friends carefully removed the car from its lofty spot, loaded it onto a trailer and drove it back to their home north of Spokane. But Kevin Williams, a self-described “car nut,” plans to have the ’54 Chevy back in Lewiston this coming summer. “We made a promise to the previous owner that the car would be at Hot August Nights this next year, running and driving,” Williams said in a phone interview with the Lewiston Tribune. “And it’ll be the same paint job, same wheels, new tires. We’ll have it at Hot August Nights 2026, for its first debut as a running car in over 25 years.” Williams, 60, was familiar with the car as an occasional customer of Wayback Cafe. After more than a quarter-century in business, the ’50s-themed cafe was closed this past spring by owner Theresa Rivers. In the fall, Williams spotted an online ad that showed Wayback’s “flying car” for sale. Over the years, he has owned a few Chevy 150s — a no-frills cruiser that is more rare than similar Chevy models from the same era like the 210 or Bel Air — and it’s one of his favorite cars. For prospective buyers of the cafe’s high-flying mascot, there was a catch: They had to find a way to get it down from the pole. So Williams recruited a few friends — one of whom was a mechanic who figured out how to unbolt the car, and one of whom had a telehandler that could hold the car and lower it to the ground — and they completed their mission Oct. 28. During the operation, Lori Williams noticed something even more unusual than the flying car — a vintage Sheriff Big Mac jail, the kind of which was seen at McDonald’s playgrounds in the ’70s and ’80s. The Williamses decided to buy that too. Williams, who is retired from a career in business management, declined to say how much he paid for his vintage items, but said the price was “very, very reasonable.” The crew got Sheriff Big Mac loaded into the back of the couple’s pickup, which was also towing the flying car. During their subsequent stops in the valley and on their trip home, their strange cargo drew many gawkers. “We were the spectacle driving through town,” Williams said. “When (other cars) passed us, they were waving and smiling and taking pictures, and we had people that solicited us to stop so they could take pictures. ... It was nice to see so many people happy about this goofy McDonald’s Sheriff Big Mac and the flying car all together on a trailer going down the highway.” Williams plans to install Sheriff Big Mac in his backyard for his grandchildren during the warmer months, and keep it in storage during winter. As for the car, he’s wasting no time. He replaced the suspension, seats and wiring with items he had in stock, and is determined to have the Chevy ready for a car show in Spokane in the spring. Despite being exposed to the elements for so long, the car’s body is “solid,” Williams said. No rust, no holes, no damage. He plans to repaint it, but with the same design and color scheme as it now has. “That car is currently in my shop and on a lift. It’ll spend the rest of its life in a nice warm shop.” Williams is also working out a deal to acquire more memorabilia from Wayback Cafe’s time in business, which started in 1997. He’s hoping to purchase the restaurant’s V-shaped sign that is also perched on a pole 20 feet above the ground. He plans to create a “hangout spot in my shop to kind of pay homage to the Wayback Cafe and some other cafes that we’ve visited.” All of these efforts are Williams’ attempt to preserve historical items. “I love history, and when things change, I always had that sense of loss. There’s obviously people that thought that car was cool and liked the whole idea of that car flying above Lewiston for as long as it has. ... And I think it’ll be quite cool to bring that thing back to the valley as a running, driving car and have it in a car show.” Baney may be contacted at mbaney@lmtribune.com or (208) 848-2251.

ANALYSIS: Final grades for the Idaho football offense,"The hype around the Idaho Vandals’ offense at the start of the season was like getting a new car. A completely new play-caller, a new quarterback under center and many fresh weapons on the outside caused excitement. In the end, it turned out to be a pretty disappointing season for the Vandals as they finished with an overall record of 4-8 and a 2-6 mark in Big Sky Conference play. Idaho coach Thomas Ford Jr. was unhappy with the results the offense was putting out on the field, so much so that he demoted offensive coordinator Matt Linehan from playcalling duties following the 28-14 UC Davis loss on Nov. 8. Linehan and Idaho “mutually parted ways” on Nov. 25, according to a Linehan X post. Idaho also decided not to bring back running backs coach Lance Dunbar to the coaching staff. The Vandals were No. 8 in the Big Sky in scoring offense, averaging 25.2 points per game. In total offense, they also ranked No. 8 in the Big Sky with 377.2 yards per game. Here are the final grades for Idaho’s offensive position groups after the season: Quarterbacks: B- It was a decent season for sophomore quarterback Joshua Wood in his first full season as a starting quarterback. He had a few games where he looked very explosive through the air and on the ground, and in others, he failed to get the ball moving much in the passing game. Wood finished No. 7 in the Big Sky with 1,898 passing yards and threw for 14 touchdowns and just five interceptions. Wood finished No. 10 in the Big Sky in rushing yards with 589 yards and seven touchdowns with a long of 59 yards on 86 carries, averaging 6.8 yards per carry. When the Vandals were without Wood for the two games he missed due to a lower-body injury, it was quite noticeable. The offense turned the ball over often in the Vandals’ 49-33 loss to Northern Colorado, and could not score very efficiently in the 21-14 loss against Eastern Washington. Without Wood, the Vandals’ offense couldn’t function, and they would have had a much worse year if he missed more time. Running backs: C+ Whenever your quarterback is leading your team in rushing yards, that points out an issue with the run game. Senior running backs Nate Thomas and Elisha Cummings were second and third in rushing on the team, respectively. Thomas rushed 109 times for a gain of 453 yards and three touchdowns, averaging just 41.2 yards per game. Cummings was injured for multiple weeks. However — except for against Portland State when he gained 65 yards on the ground and 100 through the air, and then against Northern Arizona with 106 yards rushing and 78 yards receiving — he had a tough year. Cummings totaled 71 carries for 365 yards and just two touchdowns. He averaged 36.5 yards per game. Sophomore running back Art Williams was having the best year of all the running backs until he sustained an injury before the Montana game on Sept. 27. He totaled 297 yards on 60 carries and two touchdowns, averaging 72.8 yards per game before he missed the rest of the season with an injury. With the problems that the running backs were having, it makes sense to move on from running backs coach Dunbar. Offensive line: A- This offensive line group was stout. They were the bright spot for the Vandals’ offensive unit all season and the most consistent group on either side of the ball. They ranked No. 4 in the Big Sky in sacks allowed at 17 for a loss of 118 yards, but some of that came with Wood holding on to the ball for an extended period of time because his wide receivers were not getting open right away. The rushing attack was No. 4 in the Big Sky in total rushing yards. The ground game averaged 175.4 rushing yards per game and scored 18 touchdowns. The group of left tackle Charlie Vliem, left guard Nate Azzopardi, center Layton Vining, right guard Leon Evans and right tackle Kiegan Henson proved to be one of the best offensive line units that the Vandals have had in recent seasons. Part of that has to do with the coaching of offensive line coach and run game coordinator Loren Endsley. Wide receivers and tight ends: C- This was the weakest part of the Vandals’ offense. The receivers and tight ends barely contributed at any significant level for most of the season. There were two receivers that had a “breakout” type of season, but due to injuries, their seasons were shortened. Sophomore receiver Ryan Jezioro looked like he was Wood’s No. 1 target at the beginning of the season. Through the first five weeks of the season, he put up 284 yards on 20 catches and caught three touchdowns. Since Week 5, he only played in four games and added 63 yards on seven more catches and one more touchdown. Freshman receiver Marquawn McCraney came on late in the season and was second on the team with 306 yards on 22 catches. He hauled in two touchdown passes. No other receiver really stood out. Senior tight ends Chance Bogan and Jake Cox barely contributed. Bogan had 13 catches for 107 yards, and Cox had 11 catches for 98 yards and two scores. Overall offense: C+ The offense deserves somewhere in the Cs. But I went with a C+ solely because the offensive line brought the group up so much. Also, because I think that a fully healthy Wood for the entirety of the season could have helped the Vandals to a better record. But it didn’t turn out that way. The offense was stagnant and couldn’t score many times when it mattered most. A massive shift will have to come in the offseason with the skill position groups and especially a big scheming change will have to happen for the group to excel next season.

Here's how Netflix's Warner Bros. acquisition poses risks to theatre industry,"December 07, 2025 Netflix's recent announcement to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery has surely sent the streaming world into a frenzy, but the industry that could be hit the hardest is the theatre. This unease is evident in Warner Bros. Discovery’s film studio and streaming service falling under the belt of Netflix. As Netflix is emerging victorious in a bidding war against Paramount, Skydance and Comcast, concerns are mounting over the future of theatrical releases. Industry experts have raised an alarm at the adverse implications of this impending acquisition. Shawn Robbins, the director of analytics at Fandango, noted that many theatre owners view this outcome as unfavourable, fearing significant changes to the theatre industry. Cinema United, the largest exhibition trade association, also voiced strong opposition, warning that the deal poses an unprecedented threat to theatres of all sizes, estimating that around 25% of the annual domestic box office would be removed if the deal takes place. The biggest concern surrounding the Netflix-Warner Bros. merger is in Netflix's business model, which prioritises streaming over theatrical releases. Therefore, executives are worried that this could lead to fewer film productions for cinemas and shorter theatrical windows, further curtailing box office revenues. Past trends indicate that studio consolidations led to a decrease in theatrical releases, a pattern seen when Disney acquired 20th Century Fox. Although Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has assured that Warner Bros. films will continue to be released in theatres, the specifics of these releases remain unclear, leaving the industry in uncertainty about whether these films will enjoy traditional theatrical windows or be limited to brief runs to meet award eligibility. As the deal comes to a close, theatre operators appear frightened of the implications, hoping Netflix will honour its commitments while fearing the long-term effects on their business model.",2025-12-07 08:04:00,Geo Tv,negative,0.6267,-1,Outlier, Netflix is set to acquire Warner Bros.

Sudan’s army intercepts RSF drone attack on civilian facilities in Blue Nile state,"KHARTOUM, Sudan/ISTANBUL The Sudanese army intercepted a drone attack by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that targeted civilian service facilities in Ad-Damazin, the capital of Blue Nile state, authorities said on Sunday. The Blue Nile state government said in a statement that the armed forces repelled an RSF attempt to target civilian infrastructure in the city, describing the RSF as a “terrorist militia.” It condemned “in the strongest terms” the drone attack and the rebel group’s attempt to strike the city’s power station, without providing details on casualties or damage. The power station is a vital public facility relied upon for having access to water and operating hospitals, dialysis centers and neonatal care units, the statement added. The attack reflects a “clear disregard for the lives of civilians and their humanitarian needs,” it added. Authorities reassured residents that the “situation is under control,” adding that the Sudanese army is fulfilling its duty to maintain security and stability, protect lives and property, and prevent efforts to drag the country into chaos. There was no immediate comment from the RSF on the attack. Earlier Sunday, the non-governmental Emergency Lawyers group said RSF drones targeted Ad-Damazin’s main power station Saturday, causing a total blackout and disrupting water supplies. Sudanese authorities have recently accused the RSF of carrying out a series of drone attacks on civilian facilities, including power stations and infrastructure, in northern and eastern cities. The group controls all five Darfur states out of Sudan’s 18 states, while the army holds most of the remaining 13 states, including the capital, Khartoum. The civil war between the Sudanese army and the RSF, which began in April 2023, has killed thousands of people and displaced millions of others.

Drunk North East woman shouted racist abuse at student Subway worker before stealing crisps,"A drunk woman shouted racist abuse at a student sandwich shop worker before making-off with packets of crisps. Julie Lowery walked into the Durham City branch of Subway late one evening in June before launching into a tirade of racist slurs. Fearful that the 43-year-old would try and get behind the counter, the shaken staff member called the police, which prompted Lowery to pick up packets of crisps and walk out without paying, magistrates heard. Lowery, of Pattinson Gardens, in Gateshead, has now been hit in the pocket after she pleaded guilty to a racially-aggravated public order offence and shop theft. Brian Payne, prosecuting at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court, said Lowery and a male entered Subway at around 11.30pm on June 9 this year. The pair of them asked the staff member to call the police as Lowery had a cut to her lip, however, the request was refused. Mr Payne added: ""The man left but this defendant went berserk and started screaming. The worker says this: ""I was worried she would come behind the counter as she screamed ""ring the police"". She came right up to the counter. ""She then shouted p**** b****** at me several times. I was distressed by this and felt intimidated as I have never seen this aggression before""."" In a statement, the victim said: ""I was shaken up for the rest of my shift by what happened and I won't forget the incident for a long time. I was just trying to do my job to pay for my studies."" The court heard that Lowery had an extensive criminal record and was last convicted of shop theft in 2024. Nick Moore, defending, said Lowery had spent most of her adult life living on the streets. He added: ""On this occasion, she was living in Durham City and attended Subway after being the victim of an assault by another homeless individual. She asked them to call the police and they refused to do so. ""Out of frustration, she lost her temper and said some harmful words and helped herself to some crisps. She is remorseful and there is a guilty plea."" Lowery was fined £120 and must pay £85 costs and a £48 victim surcharge. We have a dedicated newsletter for court news and updates.

Coup Attempt: ECOWAS Deploys Standby Force in Benin,"Michael Olugbode in Abuja The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Commission has deployed a standby force in Benin Republic to forestall breakdown of law and order and safeguard constitutional democracy. The deployment followed the unsuccessfully attempt by a faction of the military to oust President Patrice Tallon in the early hours of Sunday. A group of soldiers had early on Sunday appeared on Benin’s state television claiming to have ousted President Patrice Talon from office and dissolved all state institutions. The coup attempt began in the early hours of Sunday, with an attack on President Patrice Talon’s official residence in the capital Porto-Novo. The French Embassy had also said on X that “gunfire was reported at Camp Guezo” near the Talon’s home and advised French citizens to remain indoors for security. In their television appearance, the soldiers allegedly led by Lieutenant Colonel Pascal Tigri – then read out a statement, declaring they had removed the president from power. “The army solemnly commits to give the Beninese people the hope of a truly new era, where fraternity, justice and work prevail.” The loyal military group later rallied round the president to ward off the threats of the dissidents soldiers and kept democracy alive. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in early release condemned the attempted military takeover of government in Benin Republic In the first statement, the regional bloc said: “ECOWAS Commission has received with consternation reports of an attempted military take-over in the Republic of Benin. “ECOWAS strongly condemns this unconstitutional move that represents a subversion of the will of the people of Benin. “ECOWAS calls for the full respect of the Constitution of Benin and salutes the efforts of the Government and the Republican Army in bringing the situation under control. “ECOWAS holds the leaders of the plot both individually and collectively responsable for any loss to life and property occasioned by their action. “ECOWAS will support the Government and the people in all forms necessary, including the deployment of the regional standby force, to defend the Constitution and the territorial integrity of Benin.” Nigeria government also condemned the military incursion in a statement issued by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kimiebi Ebienfa. The statement read: “The Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has received with grave concern and unequivocally condemns in the strongest possible terms the attempted forcible seizure of power in our friendly neighbour and brotherly nation, the Republic of Benin in the early hours of Sunday 7th December, 2025. “This act of destabilization represents a direct assault on democracy, constitutional order, and the collective will of the Beninese people, who have consistently demonstrated their commitment to peaceful political transitions. “Nigeria stands in firm solidarity with the Government and people of the Republic of Benin, and applauds the swift action taken by Beninese authorities to protect its legitimate institutions and preserve the peace.” “We commend the courage and professionalism of the Beninese security forces in defending the constitutional order and guaranteeing the safety of the President. Their dedication ensured that the unfortunate attempt to subvert democracy was decisively repelled,” the statement added. The statement further read: “Nigeria reiterates its strong commitment to the principles of democracy, good governance, and the rule of law as fundamental pillars for peace, development and regional stability. Unconstitutional changes of government are an unacceptable and retrogressive step that threatens the hard-earned democratic gains and socio-economic progress of our sub-region. “As a steadfast partner within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union, Nigeria calls on all member states and the international community to unite in condemning this act and in reaffirming our shared commitment to the African Union’s Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, and the ECOWAS Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance. “We urge all parties in the Republic of Benin to remain calm, uphold the rule of law, and continue to channel any political discourse through peaceful, constitutional, and democratic means. “The Federal Government of Nigeria reassures the Government of the Republic of Benin of its full support and continued cooperation as we work together, as brothers and partners, to deepen democracy and ensure lasting peace and prosperity for our peoples and the entire West African region.” A second statement by ECOWAS Commission highlighted action taken to forestall democracy in Benin Republic. The statement read: “Further to its earlier statement on the Republic of Benin, the ECOWAS Commission hereby informs the general public that : 1.Persuant to the provisions of relevant ECOWAS instruments, in particular Article 25(e) of the 1999 Protocol Relating to the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management, Resolution Peacekeeping and Security, and 2.after consultation among members of the Mediation and Security Council at the level of Heads of State and Government, a.

Chelsea handed latest injury blow as Liam Delap return timeline revealed,"Chelsea striker Liam Delap is reportedly set for another lengthy spell on the sidelines after he picked up a shoulder injury in the 0-0 draw with Bournemouth. Delap was handed his second successive Premier League start on Saturday as Enzo Maresca’s side travelled to the south coast. However, the striker’s match lasted little more than 30 minutes after he landed awkwardly on his shoulder following a duel with Marcos Senesi. The Englishman was subsequently replaced by Marc Guiu, using his match shirt as a makeshift sling as he made his way off the pitch in clear discomfort. Speaking after the game, Maresca hinted that the early signs were not positive for Delap, telling reporters: ‘Unfortunately he was already out for two months and he has to be out again. Punchy analysis, transfer talk and more from Metro's football experts sent straight to your inbox – sign up, it's an open goal. ‘We don’t know for how long, but it looks quite bad, his shoulder.’ And talkSPORT are now reporting that Delap tore his shoulder ligaments in the fall and could be facing up to eight weeks out with the injury. The news will be a bitter blow for the striker, who signed for £30million from Ipswich Town over the summer but has endured a tough start to life at Stamford Bridge. Delap missed almost two months of action due to a hamstring injury which he sustained in the third league game of the season against Fulham. The striker made his return in late October against Wolves, but his cameo off the bench lasted only 26 minutes before he was sent off following a second yellow card.

But Delap is still yet to get off the mark for the Blues in the league, having scored 12 times for Ipswich under Kieran McKenna last season. With Delap out injured, Joao Pedro and Guiu are Maresca’s two centre forward options, althogh the Italian has deployed Pedro Neto centrally in recent weeks. Chelsea are in desperate need of a positive result after a midweek defeat to Leeds United and a goalless draw with Bournemouth at the weekend. The Blues currently sit fifth and eight points of league leaders Arsenal, but have a tricky upcoming fixture list over the busy festive period. Maresca’s side travel to face Atalanta in the Champions League before a home league game against Everton and a trip to Cardiff in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals. But after that, Chelsea face a tough run against Newcastle, Aston Villa, Bournemouth and Manchester City in the space of just 16 days over the Christmas and New Year period.

Chargers' Justin Herbert shares bold take on playing through injury vs. Eagles,"Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert will attempt to play the hero by playing one week removed from surgery when his team hosts the Philadelphia Eagles on the Week 14 edition of Monday Night Football. Easier said than done. Herbert suffered a fracture in his non-throwing hand in Week 13 and will be almost exactly one week removed from surgery when the Chargers-Eagles encounter kicks off under primetime lights. Still, Herbert has oozed confidence and optimism all week. Cast-glove hybrid protecting him, the Chargers quarterback was a regular at practice, albeit with limited under-center work. RELATED: NFL fines multiple Raiders for actions against the Chargers but not for egregious hit Asked about how playing with a cast might impact him, Herbert said he’s hoping things take a business-as-usual approach. “I try to play the game the same way,” Herbert said. “As long as it’s stabilized and fixed, you know, the doctors feel comfortable with it, then I think you can just move on to just playing and just try not to focus on it too much.” There have been some rumblings about backup Trey Lance entering the game in short-yardage situations because of Herbert’s ability to take a snap from under center in those scenarios. RELATED: Chargers coach gives Eagles a little confusing bulletin-board material before Week 14 Whether Lance sees the field at all, though, remains to be seen. And if everything else is business as usual for Herbert, ideally, they’d like to prevent short-yardage situations while putting up a healthy dose of points, anyway. There’s also hope that the expected return of first-rounder running back Omarion Hampton to pair with the effective Kimani Vidal will help the Chargers dominate the game script and ask very little of Herbert, anyway. Herbert is in luck, though. Names like Josh Allen of the Buffalo Bills have played chunks of seasons in recent years with similar injuries to non-throwing hands and done just fine. Similar to yesterday, Justin Herbert was being handed the ball in today’s #Chargers practice when aligning under center. No issues catching the snap in shotgun. pic.twitter.com/SzyIyKFGqh That won’t reduce the stress levels of Chargers fans much if Herbert takes a hit or extends a play with his feet and puts himself at risk. But some of the past proof from other quarterbacks is encouraging and, in the end, he’s right: Doctors cleared him. Herbert and the Chargers view it as worth the risk, regardless: A win would send them to 9-4 and keep them in the thick of the wild card hunt, while the Denver Broncos currently lead the AFC West at 10-2. — Enjoy free coverage of the Chargers from Los Angeles Chargers on SI — Sign Up For the Chargers Daily Digest - OnSI’s Free Los Angeles Chargers Newsletter Chargers rookie Oronde Gadsden accused of impacting critical $17.5 million decision Chargers predicted to ‘bludgeon’ Eagles in front of primetime audience Omarion Hampton set for Week 14 return after Chargers roster moves Chargers shockingly named as suitor for controversial star free agent WR Week 14 rooting guide as Chargers hope for help in strengthening playoff position Chris Roling has covered the NFL since 2010 with stints at Bleacher Report, USA TODAY Sports Media Group and others.

"Colonel On The Run, It’s Game Over","• Security forces arrest some of his men as dragnet widens By PHC Telegraph The leader of the mutineers who attempted to seize power in Benin Republic, Colonel Pascal Tigri, is on the run. Tigri has not been seen since after the coup-day-broadcast, but there are strong indications that a massive manhunt which may lead to his eventual arrest has been launched. It is not clear if the coup leader has slipped out of the country. Loyal troops, according to reports that are trickling in, are combing the entire country in a bid to apprehend the fugitive who has gone underground. So far, some of his associates have been arrested and credible sources believe it may be a matter of time before he is taken into custody. The Nigerian authorities are keenly monitoring the situation in that country. Nigeria views military takeovers in the ECOWAS sub region as an aberration. It is quite obvious, at least for now, that the coup has failed following the swift intervention of the nation’s defence and security forces. Alassane Seidou, Benin’s Interior Minister has surfaced on national TV to say the coup has been crushed. “Early on Sunday morning, 7 December 2025”, Seidou disclosed, “a small group of soldiers launched a mutiny aimed at destabilising the state and its institutions. “Faced with this situation, the Beninese armed forces and their leadership, true to their oath, remained committed to the republic. Their response allowed them to retain control of the situation and foil the attempt. “The government therefore urges the population to go about their activities as normal’.”",2025-12-07 20:08:36,Phc Telegraph,negative,0.5471,78,Nationals_Early_Targeting, Colonel Pascal Tigri has not been seen since after the coup-day-broadcast .

Households urged to check for rare bank notes with 1 small detail worth fortune,"Since many households would be struggling with the cost of living crisis, it's no wonder Brits will be on the hunt for money-saving methods ahead of Christmas. Whether you want to sell any old kids' toys or clothes, did it occur to you that your money could be worth, well, loads of money? Now the experts at Playcasion.com, a leading online comparison platform, revealed the bank notes which are worth thousands of pounds. Research found you could earn the most money if your bank notes have the following three details: On the original plastic £5, experts highlight the earliest AA01 notes. Meanwhile at a Bank of England charity auction, the lowest serial number available in circulation – AA01 000017 – sold for £4,150, with other AA01 notes also selling for loads. When the Jane Austen polymer £10 launched, an AA01 000010 note went for £7,200, and other early AA01 Austen £10 notes fetched similar four-figure sums, underlining just how keen collectors are to own the first notes off the press. Meanwhile Instagram user @CoinCollectingWizard always urges households to keep an eye on their change after that £10 note has been seen to flog for over £3,000. Analysis also suggests the really serious money comes when AK47 is combined with a ""fancy"" pattern in the digits: a serial like AK47 747474 has been reported selling for around £13,000, while another fiver with all six digits the same – for example 555555 – has allegedly drawn offers in excess of £3,000.

Florida: 58-year-old woman killed in a golf cart accident driven by her Greek-American husband,"A 58-year-old woman, Christina Theodosiou, died in Florida, USA, about a week ago when she fell from a golf cart driven by her 64-year-old husband. According to Law and Crime, Angelo Theodosiou was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and refusing to submit to police checks, while he claims through his lawyer that he was not drunk and did not cause the accident. According to an arrest report from the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office, the accident occurred around 10:45 p.m. on the evening of November 30, when Angelo Theodosiou was allegedly driving a golf cart with his wife as a passenger. During the ride, the 58-year-old woman fell from the vehicle and was seriously injured. “The victim, the defendant’s wife, hit her head on the ground and was airlifted by helicopter to Jacksonville Memorial Hospital with a grade 3 on the Glasgow scale during air ambulance transport.” A short time later, Christina Theodosiou succumbed to her injuries. Authorities recorded that the driver was deemed at fault (“at fault driver”) for the incident. Angelo Theodosiou was arrested and taken to the St. Johns County Jail; however, authorities say he was released on bail on December 1, one day after his arrest. His next scheduled court appearance is set for January 6, 2026. The arrest report states that the officers handling the case found evidence of alcohol consumption, including the 64-year-old’s red eyes and the odour of an alcoholic beverage which they could smell on him from three feet away in an open area. At the same time, it was reported that although the man knew that a driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) investigation was underway, he nevertheless refused to submit to a standardized sobriety test. “After being taken into custody, the defendant repeatedly asked what was going on and why he was being arrested,” the report added. The 64-year-old has been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and refusing to submit to police checks. According to the same document, while he initially allegedly agreed to submit to a breathalyzer test, he later changed his attitude. Through his attorney, Angelo Theodosiou denies the charges and maintains that he was not under the influence of alcohol nor did he cause the crash. “My client maintains his innocence, and we look forward to receiving the evidence,” his attorney, L. Lee Lockett, told the local St. Johns Citizen website. “He did not cause the accident; he was not under the influence of alcohol,” he added. The Greek-American’s attorney also noted that the 64-year-old is “devastated” by the death of his wife. The couple had moved to Florida from New York, where Theodosiou had run a restaurant in Queens for many years. According to local reports, family members of the couple say they “stand by” the defendant.

"The worst habits for your back, according to a chiropractor","From poor posture to sitting too long, our daily habits and movements can all contribute to an achy and weak back. But according to a chiropractor, with three intentional daily practices, you can maintain a healthy back and prevent any further issues from developing. ""Align daily. Move often. Support your nervous system,"" recommends Dr Sherry McAllister, a certified chiropractic sports physician and President of the Foundation for Chiropractic Progress (F4CP). The chiropractor says that your back is ""an information highway"" that supports your body in a number of ways, so it is important to take care of it. ""It is how we view our back that will make all the difference. Your back isn’t just a structure of bones, ligaments and muscles, it’s an information highway. When your spine is aligned, your nervous system performs at its best, helping you move, think, breathe, digest and recover more efficiently,"" Dr McAllister explains. ""The nervous system is so incredibly important that it has its own protective barrier to trauma: the vertebrae. Yet, insults can impact its alignment, creating a slower, less optimal performance. Now that we can see how delicate it is, you should take a moment to reflect on the a-e, if you are really taking care of this amazing system."" ""A check-in with a DC is a powerful way to optimise your health. Prevention begins with alignment. Seeing your chiropractor before pain or injury allows you to identify potential issues early, often the small, silent imbalances created by everyday habits. During your visit, your chiropractor evaluates areas such as ergonomics, gait, posture, balance, flexibility and range of motion, to name a few. ""These elements reveal how well your body is functioning and where stress may be accumulating. Poor function often develops quietly over time. Chiropractic care helps to restore balance to the spine and nervous system - an essential foundation of whole-being care."" ""Sitting for more than 45 minutes slows blood flow, tightens hip flexors, weakens stabilisers and can create stress on your spine and its three natural curves,"" the chiropractor says. ""The spine depends on these stabilisers. Even five minutes of glute bridges, bird dogs, side planks or walking can make a big difference in preventing injury."" Focusing on small movements every day is important for maintaining a healthy back. ""How you lift, sit, text, breathe, and even carry a bag affects your back. Small choices stack up, positively or negatively,"" says the author of Adjusted Reality: Supercharge Your Whole-being for Optimal Living and Longevity. Meanwhile, everything from your sleeping position to your bedding are also worth considering for the sake of your back health. ""A supportive mattress, neutral sleep position, and consistent schedule restore the stress to the spine. Equally important is your pillow. The right pillow should support the natural curve of your neck, keeping your head in a neutral position - not flexed forward, tilted back, or rotated,"" Dr McAllister says. ""When your pillow maintains that gentle C-shaped cervical curve, it reduces strain on the spine, relaxes surrounding muscles, improves breathing and allows your nervous system to reset more effectively. This small shift can dramatically improve sleep quality, reduce morning stiffness, and support your whole-being alignment."" Everything from the position of your office chair to your choice of handbag can contribute to back pain - something which Dr McAllister calls ""micro-misalignments"". ""It’s the 'micro-misalignments' that build into macro-problems. Everyday habits can quietly pull your body out of alignment, creating a cascade of effects on your spine and nervous system. Sitting too long at a desk slowly reverses the lumbar curve, overloading the discs while weakening the glutes and tightening the hip flexors. Add in the weight of a heavy or one-shoulder bag, and the spine absorbs uneven loading that rotates the shoulders and strains the upper body,"" she says. ""The familiar 'Laptop Lean,' even a two-inch forward head tilt, can triple the demand on the neck and upper back, while poor sleep posture twists joints and compresses soft tissues throughout the night. Stress compounds the issue; shallow breathing tightens the upper back, shifting posture before you’re even aware it’s happening. And when inactivity settles in, stabilisers weaken, and circulation slows, making movement feel heavier than it should."" A weak lower back may not always present with back pain; you may experience stiffness and pain elsewhere in the body, as the chiropractor explains: ""Signs of a weakened lower back often appear quietly, revealing themselves through tight hip flexors and hamstrings as surrounding muscles work overtime to compensate for a core that isn’t fully stabilising. ""You may notice a swayback or a tucked pelvis - subtle shifts in alignment that immediately reflect how well the spine is being supported. Fatigue while simply standing or walking can follow, because a strong and balanced back should hold you with effortless ease."" She adds: ""Morning stiffness becomes more frequent as the spine struggles to regain overnight support, and everyday movements such as bending, lifting or rotating, may begin to feel unsteady or uncertain. Even long periods of sitting can trigger recurring aches, a signal that your stabilising muscles are tiring more quickly than they should. ""These are all quiet messages from a system whose operating intelligence is superior to any other found on Earth: your body is asking for alignment, strength and attention so it can return to its natural state of balance."" Along with maintaining good posture and keeping active, you can also support a healthy spine and back through your diet. There are some key vitamins that are beneficial for bone health - many of which you can get through a balanced and varied diet, but that you may wish to supplement as an additional measure for a healthy body. ""Supporting spinal health begins with nourishing the body in ways that reinforce its natural strength, flexibility and mobility. Therefore, what you eat becomes a vital part of how healthy your body is. Bone health is key: Vitamin D3 plays a vital role in bone integrity and inflammation control, an especially important nutrient given how many people spend long hours indoors. The combination of Vitamin K2 with D3 ensures calcium is guided into the bones where it belongs, helping fortify the spine,"" says Dr McAllister. ""Magnesium works hand-in-hand with the nervous system, aiding muscle relaxation, nerve conduction, and easing the tension that often accumulates through stress or prolonged sitting. Omega-3 fatty acids provide powerful anti-inflammatory benefits to the discs and joints. Collagen paired with Vitamin C supports the connective tissues, ligaments and discs that allow the spine to move and absorb impact."" However, the expert warns that nutrition alone isn't enough to maintain a healthy back. ""Yet in whole-being health, nutrition is only one part of the equation. No vitamin can replace the benefits of movement, alignment and a well-regulated nervous system; together, they form the true foundation for a spine that supports your best life."" One of the life stages where a woman's back can really suffer is during pregnancy, with the additional weight and stretching ligaments often causing discomfort and contributing to back pain. However, gentle exercise like yoga may help, along with prenatal chiropractic care. ""Pregnancy is a profound season of transformation, and supporting the mother’s alignment, comfort and nervous-system balance is essential for both her health and the baby’s development. Prenatal chiropractic care uses safe, gentle adjustments to align the pelvis, reduce nerve tension and maintain the natural curves that support a growing belly,"" says Dr McAllister. ""Movement becomes medicine during this time: pelvic tilts, cat/cow, side-lying leg lifts, walking and prenatal yoga help stabilise the core and pelvis as the centre of gravity shifts. Sleep positioning also plays a vital role; resting on the left side with support under the belly and between the knees reduces lumbar stress and promotes circulation."" You may also find that focusing on breathwork and avoiding any additional strain can help to ease pregnancy back pain. ""Warm compresses combined with gentle movement relax tight tissues, while hydration and prenatal vitamins help minimise cramps and muscle tension. Because pregnancy already shifts pelvic mechanics, avoiding heavy bags and uneven loads prevents unnecessary strain,"" the chiropractor shares. ""And throughout it all, deep diaphragmatic breathing becomes a powerful tool - supporting the pelvic floor, calming the nervous system and creating a peaceful, aligned internal environment where both mother and baby can thrive.""",2025-12-08 08:04:00,Hellomagazine,neutral,0.4701,-1,Outlier," Dr Sherry McAllister says that your back is ""an information highway"" that supports your body in a number of ways . Your back isn’t just a structure of bones, ligaments and muscles, it’s an information highway . When your spine is aligned, your nervous system performs at its best ."
"Alum Bret Johnsen, SpaceX CFO, talks with Trojans about space innovation and the USC network","Dean’s Dialogue: SpaceX CFO Bret Johnsen on Space Innovation and the Trojan Network Dean Geoffrey Garrett and Bret Johnsen discuss SpaceX innovations and Trojan connections. [USC Photo / David Sprague] Dean’s Dialogue: SpaceX CFO Bret Johnsen on Space Innovation and the Trojan Network Bret Johnsen, a Leventhal alumnus, spoke with Marshall Dean Geoffrey Garrett about SpaceX’s cutting-edge projects, U.S. manufacturing, and the value of a USC education. Bret Johnsen, CFO of SpaceX and an alumnus of the USC Leventhal School of Accounting, joined Marshall Dean Geoffrey Garrett for a wide-ranging “Dean’s Dialogue” discussion on emerging technologies, radical innovation, and Trojan connections. A proud alumnus, Johnsen is also a newly appointed member of the USC Board of Trustees and the father of two Trojans. Speaking directly to the families attending Trojan Family Weekend, the CFO provided insights into the value of a USC education and the Trojan Network. “I’m a perfect example of what I want for my kids and for all of your kids, which is to find your path and be given the opportunity along the way to decide what that path is,” Johnsen said. “USC does an amazing job — did then and still does, even probably better now — of making sure that everyone is coming here to recruit your kids.” Johnsen’s path to SpaceX took a circuitous route. Originally an auditor for Coopers & Lybrand, he pivoted into a career with technology companies Broadcom and Mindspeed Technologies, where he quickly rose through the ranks. He attributes that success to a willingness to experiment and take on any job, advice he passes along to students. “When I was at Broadcom … I rotated through the company and probably took four or five different jobs in my nine years there,” Johnsen said. “When the corporate controller (principal accounting officer) role came up, the reason I got the job was because I knew more about the company than anybody else because I’d done that rotation. So push yourself, challenge yourself, and take rotations when you can.” In 2011, Johnsen was approached by a little known company named SpaceX which he initially assumed was a storage company based on the name. He soon learned it was an aerospace company, and despite admitting to the recruiter that his space knowledge began and ended with Star Wars, Johnsen took the job and has now worked for SpaceX for 14 years. The company’s work transcends multiple sectors, from space transportation and reusable rockets to planetary exploration and their internet service, Starlink. In 2025, SpaceX is projected to earn $15.5 billion in revenue, surpassing NASA’s projected 2026 budget. Despite its size, Johnsen said the company’s private status has allowed it to stay nimble and take chances other companies couldn’t afford. “If you come in [to SpaceX], you would feel like you’re in a startup,” Johnsen said. “It’s a 17,000 person startup. And that makes us incredibly nimble. It allows us to take risks.” USC has been one of our top two or three target schools for many, many years at SpaceX. — Bret Johnsen CFO, SpaceX / Leventhal Alumnus One such risk has been in reusable rockets, developed to decrease costs, increase flights, and potentially democratize space travel. Johnsen reflected on multiple disastrous and highly publicized take-offs that could have tanked a publicly traded company. Being private, however, has enabled SpaceX to support experimentation in the spirit of innovation. “It’s okay to take risks,” Johnsen said. “That responsible engineer on the floor … feels that and is able to make those decisions. I think that empowerment has been really special for us.” SpaceX’s location sparks special interest for USC families. The company was founded in Los Angeles where it remains to this day. Johnsen has used the proximity to connect with USC students and provide tours of the company factory. “It’s easy for someone like me to actually come and work with your students,” Johnsen said. “I’ve actually had student groups come to SpaceX and see the factory where we’re building satellites and rockets.” Johnsen knows better than anyone the quality of Trojan alumni, demonstrated by the numerous opportunities at SpaceX for USC graduates. “USC has been one of our top two or three target schools for many, many years at SpaceX,” Johnsen said. “I think we are one of the most attractive places to go for kids, and that’s simply because I personally know how great the education is here … If you look at what will differentiate in a very tough market, it will be top schools.” When given a chance to ask questions, one Trojan parent asked the CFO what he looks for in new hires. He had a simple answer: ""You're looking for someone who has the great skill sets that they get here at USC,” Johnsen said.

Asking Eric: Can mom work through tension in son’s relationship with dad so they can celebrate special birthday?,"Dear Eric: My son is turning 40 on December 22. My husband and I are at a quandary as to how to celebrate him. There have been issues between my husband and him over things from his childhood. We did a special trip for his older brother when he turned 40 and would like to do something special for this son’s 40th as well. Our daughter-in-law has made special plans for him and we are not included. I understand that, but I need some ideas as to how to celebrate this extra special year without rocking the boat. I love my son with all my heart, as I do all my children, and want his 40th birthday to be memorable in a positive way. Any suggestions? – Mom Who Wants to Celebrate Dear Mom: The issues your son and your husband are having may be an obstacle, but they aren’t insurmountable. And the thing that can get them on the path to resolution is the same thing that can get you answers about how to celebrate your son: open communication. It’s not within your purview to try to fix things between them, but you have your own relationship with your son and so I’d encourage you to reach out and tell him what you told me: you want to celebrate him, you know things are difficult, and you’re looking for options. This is deceptively simple and it’s something that all of us so often neglect to do. It can feel awkward to acknowledge tension in a relationship or to ask someone what they want or how they want to feel valued, but that kind of vulnerability is the cornerstone of healthy communication. Your son may not have a concrete idea about what you can do to celebrate him; that’s OK, too. But by bringing it up, you introduce the idea that you want to celebrate him, that he’s important to you, and that you’re putting his needs first here. That’s going to go a long way. Your celebration with your son may not end up happening for the actual 40 th birthday, but by laying the groundwork now, you keep the lines of communication open for a meaningful celebration when everyone is ready.

Fabrizio Romano: Mohamed Salah Could Miss Liverpool vs Inter Milan After Outburst,"Mohamed Salah could be out of Liverpool’s squad to face Inter Milan in the Champions League following his explosive public outburst on Saturday, senior GIVEMESPORT correspondent Fabrizio Romano has revealed. The Egypt international made headlines following Liverpool’s 3-3 draw with Leeds, as he accused the club of 'throwing him under the bus' after being dropped to the bench for a third Premier League game in a row. Salah, who also revealed that his relationship with head coach Arne Slot is broken, is believed to have 'shocked' those internally at the club with his comments, with discussions ongoing over the Egyptian’s status ahead of Tuesday’s clash with Inter. Slot is due to speak to the press today ahead of Liverpool’s return to Champions League action, as the Reds look to bounce back following their 4-1 home loss to PSV last time out. Romano, writing on X, revealed that Salah could miss Liverpool’s trip to Inter Milan following his explosive post-match comments on Saturday, with a final verdict on the Egypt international expected today. Salah has played just 45 minutes across Liverpool’s last three Premier League games, having been brought off the bench during their 1-1 home draw with Sunderland last week. The Egyptian forward has struggled for form this season, scoring four times and providing two assists in 13 Premier League appearances. He has added another two goal involvements in five Champions League games, with Liverpool collecting nine points during that run. Salah’s public outburst following Liverpool’s 3-3 draw at Leeds is unlikely to have any negative impact on Slot’s future as manager. According to reports, Liverpool remain behind the Dutch tactician despite their disappointing run of form, winning just twice in their last 10 Premier League games. During that stretch, the Reds have collected only eight points from a possible 30 and lost ground to league leaders Arsenal, who are 10 points ahead.

Children's Auction still seeking donations of items for bid,"BELMONT — Right up to the 11th hour before the 44th Greater Lakes Region Children’s Auction starts, donations were pouring in on Monday, as volunteers and board members prepared for the annual event that has raised more than $9.2 million to help local children since it began. Greg Lafoe, an employee for Watermark Marine Supply Store, pushed a shopping cart with boxes of inflatable kayaks and towable tubes through the entry of the auction headquarters on Monday afternoon. Wearing a smile, knowing the items will surely make someone happy and also provide funds for children's causes, Lafoe said he loves to be able to give back to his community. “Anything to help out people in need,” Lafoe said. A short time after, auction Chair Doug Morissette walked into the headquarters with an envelope of cash donations in his hand, much to the delight of Executive Director Jenn Kelley. “There are never enough donations, because the need really just keeps growing year after year,” Kelley said. “The more items we get, the more money we make, and the more money we give. While we are so grateful for the amount of items we have right now, we are always asking for more.” The day before the auction is one of both anticipation and excitement for all who take part. This year is different, however, as it is the first event without Warren Bailey, the founder and the driving force behind the auction. While he is not there in a physical form — he died in August — Kelley said his spirit will always live on and continue to inspire those involved. “We’ve got so many volunteers helping and people coming in to give donations, dropping off items,” Kelley said. “This year is all in celebration of Warren Bailey, who sadly passed this summer. I am so incredibly grateful that he was the visionary that he was to start this. The community relies on the money we raise.” Morissette said on Monday the group had about 1,500 items to auction off so far, and about 2,800 are needed. He is encouraging people to keep bringing items in. They can be dropped off all week long. “People were dropping off all weekend,” he said. “We had a lot of items dropped off Saturday and Sunday, with just over 500 dropped. That is fantastic. It is amazing to see the community do this for such a great cause.” Kelley said this is an “incredibly giving and thoughtful community,"" and she could not be more excited for this week’s push to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for children in the Lakes Region. While Laconia is at the heart of the distribution, it spans far and wide, going all the way west to Andover, north to Sandwich, east to Ossipee, and south to Pittsfield. Lakes Region Public Access and Lakes 101.5 FM are handling the brunt of the broadcasting for the week-long event, and representatives of both were making sure all was getting set up and ready to go. Grace McNamara, station manager for LRPA, spent Monday making sure the audio and video feeds were working properly, using past experience to ensure a seamless production. She and her husband Marc, who was also volunteering at the auction, were sorting through headsets and making sure all the gear was in place. “Today’s our last day to double check the audio and video, and then tomorrow morning we go live over broadcast and streaming,” said McNamara, who is in her 11th year as the station manager. “I’m the fourth station manager with the auction, and I know I speak for everyone when I say it is an honor to work with so many volunteers in the community.” McNamara said it is truly a giant family that puts it all together, and every person has a role in making it work. Lakes FM owner Dirk Nadon has been with the auction since its start. He reminisced about the work Bailey, his good friend, did since he started the event, raising just over $2,100 out of a radio station van. “He sparked an idea that has now raised almost $10 million,” Nadon said. “How do you compare that with anything?” Debbie Frawley Drake has been volunteering for “many, many years,” and will be at the auction from start to finish. She said watching the community come together is the best part of all. “It makes my heart smile,” she said. “This helps so many kids and brings so much positivity, and we need that more now than ever.” Amy Daley is recently retired, and is not only a new Gilford resident, she is also new to the auction board of directors. She has helped with the Christmas in July cruise on the M/S Mount Washington, as well as selling ornaments, and getting together the Governor’s Island Club’s first ever Pub Mania team. Daley puts an emphasis on children and education when it comes to her charitable giving, and she said the Children’s Auction is the perfect way to give back. “I am having a ball,” Daley said. Larry Poliquin is the store manager for Hannaford in Bristol, which for the fifth year is the presenting sponsor of the event. He is also the vice chair of the board of directors, and serves on the distribution committee, determining how the funds are divvied out. “A lot of people see this as a holiday season kickoff,” said Poliquin, who has been involved in the auction for 20 years. “There’s a lot of anticipation and excitement going on, and we’re just hopeful that the community will come together in a big way like they do each year.” Veronica Rosa, chief advancement officer for Concord Hospital, said for the second straight year, she will be there with her entire senior leadership team. “I’m so excited for this week,” she said. “I love this stuff.” Board member Bob Laraway was looking around the auction headquarters as volunteers ran around, conferring with one another on what was needed to make everything run. Everyone is a cog in a system that will, this week, raise money to assist about 42,000 children in need. “This is purely community driven,” Laraway said. “It’s a labor of love for all of us.” The auction will kick off at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 9, with Morrissette saying there will be an unveiling of a dedication to Bailey. “He was able to bring the community together, and that is the whole point every single year, to help kids in need,” Morrissette said. “That is what he was all about. Warren will always be in our hearts."" Auction headquarters is at Belknap Marketplace, and the Greater Lakes Region Children's Auction runs 9 a.m.-7 p.m., Tuesday through Friday, Dec. 9-12. It will be broadcast daily on Lakes 101.5 FM, Lakes Region Public Access channels 25 and 9002 on Breezeline, and Comcast Channel 8, and streamed live at laconiadailysun.com and childrensauction.org.

Newcomers help grow roster size for Raider gymastics team,"Northfield gymnastic captains for 2025-26 are (L-R) Kate Wiber and Tara Alaniz. (Photo by Tom Nelson, Northfield News) The Northfield High School gymnastics team will certainly have a new look this season as the Raider roster will include 10 newcomers along with five returning student-athletes from last year’s team. “As for the strengths of the team, we have more new girls then returners. Some may look at that as a weakness but it really excites me because it allows us to shape the team the way we want it to be,"" said NHS head coach Zoe Ingersoll, who begins her fifth season as the Raiders’ head coach and seventh season overall with the team. The team has also seen a notable increase in size as last year’s roster size was eight and this year the roster will include the 10 newcomers along with five returners including captains junior Kate Wiebe and senior Tara Alainz along with junior CoCo Shuster, junior Avery Sammon and senior Samantha Pasch. “What I see as a strength is that we have so many different girls here that we have the opportunity to shape our program. Since our team was so small last year, this will be a great opportunity to grow our program and spread the love of gymnastics,” Alainz said. Ingersoll noted the impact that her captains will have on the squad this season as athletes and as team leader. “I’m really excited about the captains and how they are leading the team. When I look for captains each year, I look for people who are born leaders, or are growing to be leaders, and they can change the energy of their team. They don’t have to be the strongest athlete of every event but that they are someone who the team will notice when they are gone.” The Raider coach is happy to see the larger squad size this season and looks forward to working with the new athletes on the team. “A lot of these girls who are joining the high school team I coached in their early club days, so it is fun to get to coach them again, see how much they have grown and how far they will go in high school,” Ingersoll said. “There are a couple of girls coming over to the high school team from different gyms so it has been fun to have them try new things and see what they are able to do. The girls who I have seen before who have come out this year are right on the edge of getting new skills, so it is really fun to see those skills start to go into their routines.” Wiebe talked about what she sees as a strength of this year’s team. “The strengths of this team are our team chemistry, we work hard and that we like to have a lot of fun.” She also provided her insight into being a team captain for the Raiders this season, “I just like to work super hard and want to be a good role model for my teammates, and try to have a positive attitude at all times so it will have a positive effect on the whole team.” Alaniz continued with her thoughts on being a team captain, “I just want to spread that positivity and make sure everyone is having fun and working hard. With all the new girls, our goal is to have fun and make them enjoy the sport more and to see what it is all about.” Fans should expect an evolving lineup for the Raider this season as many of the team’s newcomers gain varsity experience. As Northfield looks ahead to the upcoming season, Owatonna is the reigning state champion and should be a team to beat in both the conference and section. The other top teams to watch in the section include Farmington and Lakeville South. “We have a tough section with a lot of talented teams,” Ingersoll said. The Raiders opened the 2025-26 season on Friday, Dec. 5 with a meet in Rochester against Mayo, John Marshall and Century. Northfield won the quad meet with a score of 126.95, while Century placed second with a score of 122.175 followed by Mayo with 111.25 and John Marshall with 70.1. Ninth grader Evelyn Hubers led the Raiders with a first place score in the All-Around standings of 32.35 followed by Wiebe in second place at 31.975 and Sammon in third place at 31.3. Hubers placed first in the vault competition at 8.8 and teammate sophomore Josie Porter was second at 8.4. Sammon won the beam event with a score of 8.375 followed in second place by Wiebe at 7.875 and Evelyn Podracky in sixth place at 7.5. Sammon also gained a second place finish in the floor event with a score of 8.6 with Hubers in third place at 8.475 and Wiebe in fourth place at 8.4. On the bars, Wiebe led the Raiders with a fourth place score of 7.1 and Hubers was fifth at 7.675 and Pasch was seventh at 7.025. To complete the weekend, Northfield placed eight at the Prior Lake Invitational on Saturday, Dec. 6 with a team score of 130.7. Lakeville South led the meet with a score of 140.1 followed by New Prague (138.7), Prior Lake (137.5), Apple Valley-Eastview (136.65), Lakeville North (136), Farmington (135.15) and Rosemount (133.9). Hubers led Northfield with a 10th place finish in the All-Around and the vault and a 19th place finish in the floor event.

Magnitude 7.5 quake in northern Japan injures 23 people and triggers a tsunami,"TOKYO (AP) — A powerful 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck off northern Japan late Monday, injuring more than 20 people and triggering a tsunami of up to 70 centimeters (28 inches) in Pacific coast communities, officials said. The Japanese government was still assessing damages from the tsunami and late-evening quake, which struck at about 11:15 p.m. (1415 GMT) in the Pacific Ocean around 80 kilometers (50 miles) off the coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan’s main Honshu island. “I’ve never experienced such a big shaking,” convenience store owner Nobuo Yamada told the public broadcaster NHK in the Aomori prefecture town of Hachinohe, adding that “luckily” power lines were still operating in his area. A tsunami of 70 centimeters was measured in Kuji port in Iwate prefecture, just south of Aomori, and tsunami levels of up to 50 centimeters struck other coastal communities in the region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said 23 people were injured, including one seriously. Most of the victims were hit by falling objects, NHK reported, adding that several people were injured in a hotel in Hachinohe and a man in Tohoku was slightly hurt when his car fell into a hole. The meteorological agency reported the quake's magnitude as 7.5, down from its earlier estimate of 7.6. It issued an alert for potential tsunami surges of up to 3 meters (10 feet) in some areas and later downgraded to an advisory. Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara urged residents to go to higher ground or seek shelter until advisories were lifted. He said about 800 homes were without electricity, and that the Shinkansen bullet trains and some local lines were suspended in parts of the region. Nuclear power plants in the region were conducting safety checks, Kihara said. The Nuclear Regulation Authority said about 450 liters (118 gallons) of water spilled from a spent fuel cooling area at the Rokkasho fuel reprocessing plant in Aomori, but that its water level remained within the normal range and there was no safety concern. About 480 residents were taking shelter at the Hachinohe Air Base, and 18 defense helicopters were mobilized for a damage assessment, Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said. About 200 passengers were stranded for the night at New Chitose Airport in Hokkaido, NHK reported. The meteorological agency issued a caution about possible aftershocks in the coming days. It said there is a slight increase in risk of a magnitude 8-level quake and possible tsunami occurring along Japan's northeastern coast from Chiba, just east of Tokyo, to Hokkaido. The agency urged residents in 182 municipalities in the area to monitor their emergency preparedness in the coming week. Satoshi Kato, a vice principal of a public high school in Hachinohe, told NHK that he was at home when the quake struck, and that glasses and bowls fell and smashed into shards on the floor. Kato said he drove to the school because it was designated an evacuation center, and on the way he encountered traffic jams and car accidents as panicked people tried to flee. Nobody had yet come to the school to take shelter, he said. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, in brief comment to reporters, said the government set up an emergency task force to urgently assess the extent of damage. “We are putting people’s lives first and doing everything we can,” she said. Later, she urged residents in the region to pay attention to the latest information from local municipalities. “Please be prepared so you can immediately evacuate as soon as you feel a tremor."" The quake struck about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Hachinohe, and about 50 kilometers (30 miles) below the sea surface, the meteorological agency said. It was just north of the Japanese coast that suffered the magnitude 9.0 quake and tsunami in 2011 that killed nearly 20,000 people. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Asking Eric: We’ve had a rough year. How do we tell family we want no gifts this holiday?,"Dear Eric: In a year that has been filled with not-so-great things,( family members being furloughed, health issues, rising costs) how does one tell the family you don’t want any gifts? My husband and I have plenty of things, we don’t need any things or clothing or food. In the past the family members have all planned lists. There are children that will get gifts from Santa but how do we tell the rest of the fairly large family that enough is enough? – Realistic Gift-Giving Dear Gift-Giving: Meet their lists with a list of your own. You can make a list of charities you’d like them to contribute to in lieu of gifts, or a list of gifts that can’t be bought, like quality time or homemade treats. Or your list can have just one item: “we have everything we could want. All we ask for is your continued love and support.” Dear Eric: This is in response to “Walking Seniors,” whose neighbor would turn the sprinkler on them when they walked by his house. I happen to be a lawyer. I would suggest the letter writer bypass the police who are doing nothing, go directly to his state attorney or district attorney’s office and file a complaint of harassment. And I would get a temporary restraining order through the clerk’s office against the person who owns the house. A temporary restraining order, at least in my state, would require a hearing to make it permanent, drawing that man in front of the court which I believe any judge in his right mind will then school him on how to be neighborly. I have never sent an email like this. But that story kind of touched me and I think there are legal avenues this couple can pursue so they can still walk down their street, pet the cats they’ve come to love and not be assaulted by proxy neighbors. – Another View Dear View: Thank you for this insight. It’s a good way to escalate the issue without escalating the conflict. Some readers responded to the letter with frustration that this couple had to endure harassing behavior from this neighbor with little recourse beyond taking matters in their own hands. It felt important to me not to advise them to put themselves in danger, considering the neighbor’s behavior suggests there’s other issues at play. So, your solution of finding other authorities who can intervene is a welcome one. Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O. Box 22474, Philadelphia, PA 19110.

Clarkston vows to restore EMS money,"Clarkston officials plan to restore funding for emergency medical services in the 2026 budget. The surprise announcement was made at Monday night’s city council meeting after an hour-long executive session, public comments and regular business. “It has become apparent to us that we have no options,” Councilor Skate Pierce told the crowd. “We need to figure out the EMS situation.” Last month, the EMS levy was shot down by voters, and the ambulance service was cut from the proposed 2026 budget. Officials said a budget amendment is in the works with hopes the city can dig up enough money to fund “some or all” of EMS in the coming year at the current levels. The council’s commitment to finding a solution garnered applause from the audience, which was largely made up of past and present firefighters and their families. With more time on the table, Pierce said the city can go through the process of finding out whether it’s more feasible to maintain the ambulance service or contract with a neighboring jurisdiction. A similar study was done nine years ago, and the council voted to keep Clarkston’s emergency medical services. Councilor Robin Albers said as stewards of taxpayer money and the community, the council will work diligently to make sure the budget is sound. The city has more money going out than coming in, so it’s not going to be easy, she said. “We are going to do our best,” Albers said. Pierce agreed it will be complicated, but said there is light at the end of the tunnel for EMS. The fire department will be allotted enough money to run the ambulance service longer than previously anticipated. Certain steps must be followed during the process, he said, including how recent layoffs will be handled. Negotiations with the professional firefighters union were not mentioned. The change in direction gives the council more time to study revenues and expenses, Albers said. Like other small cities, Clarkston is struggling with a tough budget, she said. During public comments, several people spoke in support of EMS, including an emergency room physician, a health care worker, a concerned resident and a retired firefighter.

USC student wins $4 million California State Parks grant to build San Bernardino park and wellness center,"Jorge Zatarain is overseeing the development of a 20,000-square-foot community center in his hometown of San Bernardino. (Photo courtesy of Zatarain) Jorge Zatarain has spent almost his whole life in San Bernardino, but it wasn’t until he briefly left that he saw the beauty of his home city. Zatarain’s first job out of college took him to 35 different U.S. states, where he helped Chevrolet market cars at sports venues and major events. Seeing so many cities made him realize that there was so much potential in San Bernardino – with its art, culture and scenic backdrop of mountains – despite its economic and public safety challenges. “I realized, ‘Oh my god, San Bernardino is beautiful,’” Zatarain said. “We’re one hour from the mountains, one hour from the beach, one hour from the desert. It’s such a centralized location. There’s so much opportunity here.” That epiphany sparked a career that has largely focused on helping San Bernardino communities. Now, the Master of Nonprofit of Leadership & Management (MNLM) student at the USC Price School of Public Policy is overseeing an ambitious project that could help his home city fulfill its potential. Master of Nonprofit Management & Leadership USC’s MNLM provides the critical skills and training you need to lead complex nonprofit and mission-driven organizations. As Director of Operations at the nonprofit El Sol Neighborhood Educational Center, Zatarain is overseeing development of a 20,000-square-foot park and wellness center in San Bernardino. Plans include a playground, community garden, basketball courts, a game room, and library, among other amenities. Zatarain, who previously co-founded his own nonprofit supporting young people in the region, helped the project win a $4.25 million grant from California State Parks and $250,000 from the City of San Bernardino. The project is set to break ground in January. “What’s important about this project is that it’s a community park, but it’s owned by a nonprofit. You can get guaranteed maintenance, guaranteed safety, guaranteed that it is going to be taken care of,” Zatarain said. “We’re hoping to bring this to the community in a safe and appropriate way.” El Sol is still finalizing plans, but the nonprofit aims to accomplish this by operating the community center as a membership. That can help the nonprofit ensure safety – by requiring people to check in and out – and track data on its impact. Membership fees would be affordable, perhaps as low as $1 annually, Zatarain said. “Jorge is an impressive example of a nonprofit leader making a life changing impact in a community that has, for decades, been so under-resourced,” said Regina Birdsell, Director of the MNLM program at the USC Price School. The job at El Sol is especially rewarding to Zatarain, a first-generation college graduate who grew up in a low-income community after his parents immigrated from Mexico. Launched in 1991, El Sol serves vulnerable communities in the Inland Empire through programs ranging from early childhood education to workforce development. “The community we serve is a direct representation of the community who raised me,” Zatarain said. Zatarain is also Co-Founder and Executive Director of Lifting Our Stories, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting youth through activities like outdoor exploration or hands-on drone training. The goal is to create experiences that help young people unlock their potential and create meaningful change in their lives and communities. “A single conversation, a single experience can change the trajectory of a young person’s life,” Zatarain said. He would know. When Zatarain was a teenager working in construction with his father, the owner of a beautiful house with a USC flag outside talked to him about his education and career journey. That talk pushed Zatarain to pursue higher education. “Hearing someone who looked successful say he started from the same kind of working-class background as mine hit me hard,” Zatarain said. “That conversation changed everything. It opened my eyes. It showed me that my path didn’t have to be limited to what I grew up around.” Stay informed with our newsletter!

The AFLW trade deals waiting to be done on Deadline Day,"A SERIES of deals are delicately poised heading into the final day of the AFLW Trade Period including Carlton's move for Brooke Boileau, Essendon's for Zoe Prowse and North Melbourne's for Kristie-Lee Weston-Turner. However, Hawthorn has emerged as the circuit breaker in trade talks taking Brisbane spearhead Taylor Smith to Sydney after a three-club deal for the two-time premiership player progressed strongly on Tuesday. TRADE TRACKER Every deal of the 2025 trade periodDRAFT ORDER Every pick for every club Smith, as well as picks No.11, 15, 18 and the Swans' future first-round selection, are all a chance of being involved in a mega deal with a series of later picks also swapping hands between the three clubs. There is increasing optimism that a deal for Smith will be struck well ahead of the trade deadline, with Sydney managing negotiations while attempting to retain a series of top-30 selections itself to match bids on Academy duo Alex Neyland and Kiera Yerbury. Carlton appears to be the busiest club ahead of Wednesday's 4pm AEDT trade deadline, with a move for Boileau hanging in the balance after another tense 24 hours of talks with Adelaide. A trade taking Boileau to Ikon Park centring around Carlton's No.16 pick looked to be agreed on Monday night, but the terms of that deal were suddenly altered by the Blues on Tuesday morning forcing Adelaide to back away from discussions. A number of clubs – including Essendon and Hawthorn – have since looked to swoop in on Boileau, though she remains adamant on heading to Carlton if negotiations can be resumed on Wednesday. The Blues have since looked to involve multiple different clubs in pick swaps to potentially unlock a deal for Boileau, though those talks are yet to produce a result heading into the Trade Period's final day. Carlton is not only juggling a move for Boileau but also a crunch on list spots, with Keeley Skepper heading to West Coast for a swap of later picks on Tuesday and with Mia Austin likely on her way to Melbourne. Both players were recently told to explore opportunities elsewhere – despite both being former first-round picks and both being contracted at the Blues for next season – with the Demons likely to part with a future pick to secure Austin. Carlton has already had multiple offers to secure a deal for Greater Western Sydney's star defender Cambridge McCormick repeatedly shut down across the Trade Period, with hopes quickly fading on the All-Australian's chances of a trade. A move for Prowse has also hit a snag, with Essendon rejecting Adelaide's request for the No.6 pick to be involved in a deal for the young defender and instead only offering its No.13 selection heading into deadline day. The Crows have shown a willingness to give something back to the Bombers, should they include the No.6 pick in negotiations, but that has so far appeared off-limits for officials at Tullamarine. A deal for Weston-Turner is also seen as being in the balance, with cagey talks between North Melbourne and Western Bulldogs officials resuming earlier this week for the former No.1 draft pick. The Kangas have made minor improvements to their initial offer of the No.37 pick for Weston-Turner across recent days after that bid was emphatically rejected, with hopes of a compromise still flickering going into deadline day. North Melbourne could still bring in more trade capital to unlock a deal for Weston-Turner, rather than force her to the draft, with Collingwood among the sides looking to take advantage of the quality in depth at Arden Street. The Magpies have lined up a deal for five-game ruck Ariana Hetherington and should be able to secure a move on Wednesday, while they are also among the teams chasing a trade for Irish forward Niamh Martin. Martin, who missed North Melbourne's 2025 season after returning to Ireland, is still deciding on whether to join Hetherington at Collingwood or take up an enticing offer to play for Hawthorn next year. The Western Bulldogs have engaged multiple clubs on potential pick swaps as they look to seal a trade for Collingwood midfielder Mikala Cann, with a selection in between their current picks at No.8 and No.26 likely to unlock an agreement. Collingwood vice-captain Jordy Allen has had an interest in moving to Brisbane, as does fellow youngster Lily-Rose Williamson, though any deals will likely have to progress late given the Smith situation. Richmond is another club monitoring a potential last-minute trade, having held an interest in Fremantle's Dana East across the last fortnight and having met with the midfielder in recent days. Hawthorn is holding out for a first-round pick to be involved in trade talks for former captain Tilly Lucas-Rodd, though the GWS offer has only involved a future second-round selection so far. Jacqui Dupuy decided on a trade to Hawthorn on Tuesday, having also had interest from Essendon, with Gold Coast set to stash yet more draft picks away for its Academy talent in a deal for the veteran forward. St Kilda is locked in negotiations around a move for Hawthorn youngster Sophie Butterworth, having already completed a deal sending veteran defender Nicola Stevens to Geelong to improve its 2026 draft hand on Tuesday. A number of other pick swaps had been discussed on Tuesday, incorporating as many as 12 different teams, as clubs continue to jockey for position in the draft order and look to recoup vital trade assets. Brisbane's Sophie Peters had interest from West Coast but has opted to stay at the Lions, while Adelaide's Kiera Mueller has also re-signed at the Crows amid interest from Richmond and Collingwood.

In race to end China’s chokehold on critical minerals the U.S. needs all the friends it can get,"Pini Althaus saw the signs. In 2023, he left the company he founded, USA Rare Earth, to develop critical minerals mining and processing projects in central Asia, after realizing that the U.S. will need all the international help it can get to end China’s supply-chain dominance.“I realized we only have a handful of large critical minerals projects that were going into production between now and 2030,” Althaus, chairman and CEO of Cove Capital, told Fortune. “I understood that we’re going to have to supplement the United States critical minerals supply chain with materials coming in from our allied and friendly countries.”Over a series of decades, China built up its stranglehold on much of the world’s critical minerals supply chains, including the 17 rare earths, used to make virtually all kinds of high-performance magnets and parts for vehicles, computers, power generation, military defense, and more. The rest of the world deferred to Beijing in exchange for cheap prices. Amid an ongoing tariff war with the U.S.—and a temporary truce—the Trump administration is racing to build up domestic mining and processing capabilities, while also developing the global partnerships necessary to eventually undermine China, which controls 90% of the world’s rare earths refining. In October, Trump inked a deal with Australia for both countries to invest $3 billion in critical minerals projects by mid-2026. Australia is home to the largest publicly traded critical minerals miner in the world, Lynas Rare Earths. Trump then signed a series of bilateral critical minerals deals in East and Southeast Asia, including Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Cambodia. The U.S. also has new deals with Ukraine, Argentina, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Kazakhstan, and more. Althaus is specifically developing mining and processing facilities for tungsten—a heat-resistant metal used in electronics and military equipment—and rare earths in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. He sees the most potential in former Soviet Union nations in central Asia. “The Soviets spent many decades exploring and developing mines. Many of their databases have been left and are quite meticulous,” Althaus said. “This gives companies looking to develop projects in central Asia a jump start compared to what would be here in the United States, where most of the opportunities are greenfield—very early stages, very high risk, and very little appetite for investment.” In November, the U.S. Ex-Im Bank offered Cove Capital a $900 million financing letter of interest for the $1.1 billion Kazakh tungsten projects. A separate letter of interest was received from the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. Jeff Dickerson, principal advisor for the Rystad Energy research firm, said only a long-term, coordinated effort—essentially a “wartime” approach—both domestically and with international partnerships can lead to success. But it cannot be done without new projects with foreign allies. “The challenge is that the U.S. doesn’t have a strong pipeline of mature mineral projects that are shovel ready,” he said. “The cycle of China extracting concessions on the back of mineral geopolitics and weakening the U.S. strategic negotiating position will likely continue without a coordinated, long-term response during the current moment of heightened attention to critical minerals,” Dickerson said, questioning whether the U.S. will maintain a concerted focus for years to come. The Trump administration is increasingly making financial partnerships with critical minerals developers—even becoming a majority shareholder in U.S. rare earths miner MP Materials—and offering deals for floor-pricing mechanisms to offset China’s recurring dumping practices that aim to eliminate competition. A native Australian turned New Yorker, Althaus is, naturally, a big fan of this approach. Chinese price dumping has crippled global competition and scared away potential investors, he said. “By providing a price floor, it removes the question marks; it removes the instability; it removes the most significant risk in funding a project that’s about to go into production,” Althaus said. “It creates a predictability where you can take geology all the way through to profitability. I think there should be a global effort to create transparent markets and prices for the key critical minerals.” Critical minerals are increasingly included in U.S. negotiations for all foreign deals. In the tariff agreement with Indonesia, for instance, the Asian nation agreed to lift export bans on nickel. The White House leveraged its military support for Ukraine by demanding the rights to its critical minerals in return. And the recent U.S. bailout of Argentina included a partnership on critical minerals mining. In addition to its strategic defense location, rare earths are another reason Trump continues to show interest in annexing Greenland from Denmark. Veteran geologist Greg Barnes, who founded the massive Tanbreez mining project in Greenland, which remains in development, briefed Trump at the White House during his first presidential term. This year, Critical Metals acquired 92.5% ownership of the Tanbreez project. Critical Metals CEO Tony Sage is keen to supply the U.S. with desired rare earths, and the company recently received a letter of intent for a $120 million Ex-Im Bank loan. The goal is to start construction by the end of 2026. “There’s an absolute need to make sure that more than 50% of the supply of these heavy rare earths come from outside of China—mined and processed outside of China,” Sage told Fortune. Regardless of any long-shot annexation bids, Sage said Greenland can and should be a key ally to the U.S. for critical minerals. “They definitely don’t want to be part of the U.S., but I think they’ll be pro-U.S.,” he said.

"TUESDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK: Like most breakups, it’s best for Washington State to move past Jimmy Rogers","COMMENTARY He said all the right things. Heck, Jimmy Rogers was well on his way to doing all the right things, too, with a top 20 defense, a 5-1 record at Gesa Field and a season good enough to earn the Washington State football program its ninth bowl game berth in the last 10 full seasons and lay a foundation for a team that could compete for championships in the new Pac-12. He may have been a real catch for the Cougs. However, there were signs that this was just not going to work out long-term. So, after a 6-6 debut season at Wazzu, Rogers jumped on a plane to Ames, Iowa, to begin his tenure as Iowa State’s head football coach. And the cruelest revelation of them all? He was texting ISU the whole time. “Me and (ISU athletic director) Jamie (Pollard), he used to text me prior to every game, like, ‘Hey, good luck.’ And I think that’s pretty awesome for him to think that way,” Rogers said during his Iowa State introductory news conference on Monday. “And I never expected it to happen this fast because of the job that Matt Campbell was doing, but I’m blessed to be here.” According to The Athletic, Pollard said that his friendship with Rogers began several years ago at an event organized by Rogers’ agent, when he was the head coach at FCS South Dakota State. “The first time I met him, he said to me, ‘How do I become the head coach at Iowa State University?’” Pollard said, according to The Athletic. “I told him, you’re probably going to need to go one more level (up) before you get here. And we stayed in contact. When I asked him why he was going to Washington State, he said, ‘It was because you told me I needed to go to the next level.’” When asked to clarify Pollard’s comments during his introductory news conference on Monday, Rogers reiterated language from the statement he posted to his X (formerly Twitter) account. “I didn’t take the Washington State job and move across the country to abandon it in one year,” Rogers said. “I didn’t. I took that jump because I believed in that product and in what I could produce there.” However, Rogers spoke for about 10 seconds longer than he probably should have — something I appreciated from covering him the past year, because it was in his second wind answers where he really told you how he felt. “I know nobody wants to hear it and I know I’ll get bashed, but it is what it is,” Rogers said. “Everybody will find a way to complain about something and I’m blessed to be here.” Those sentiments make the abrupt end of the Jimmy Rogers era at WSU after just one year not that surprising. It’s just another in a long line of gut punches for the Cougars, which has included the collapse of a century-old conference and its associated revenue, the downsizing of the WSU athletic department, a presidential transition, two athletic director transitions — one who defected to WSU’s cross-state rival, the second of which is actively happening after President Elizabeth Cantwell fired Anne McCoy — and the departure of two head football coaches within 11 months of each other to Power Four jobs. While many Coug fans are justifiably angry, the notion expressed on social media that Rogers did not care about Cougar football is a bit dramatic. The nuance is that he cared about his players, his staff and the opportunity to win football games. Rogers seemed bought in to boosting WSU back into a revered national brand and into the College Football Playoff spotlight. He just didn’t expect his dream job to open up this soon. It’s not just a pay raise, a massive resources boost and a ticket into the Power Four coaching circle that attracted Rogers to Ames, Iowa. Rogers said the chance for his kids to grow up hours away from their cousins and be rooted in the Midwest is important. For someone who had spent all but two years of his adult life in Brookings, S.D., at South Dakota State, the Midwest return is something to understand on a human level. It reminds me of Kyle Smith’s reasoning for taking the Stanford job. Key difference: Smith left WSU men’s basketball after five years and got the Cougs into the NCAA Tournament. Rogers left WSU after one year and achieved far less than he promised. His killer quote from his WSU introduction in January about “Being as loyal as it gets,” and getting the Cougs to the CFP, has aged like spoiled milk. WSU is not in the best of places financially, just two years removed from the Pac-12’s splintering. This fact no doubt bothered Rogers. Rogers cited an NIL disparity when explaining why he kept his Apple Cup starting quarterback a secret in order to gain a competitive advantage and contend with the Washington Huskies' $20 million roster. That effort proved fruitless as the Cougars lost to UW 59-24 on Sept. 20 in Pullman. However, it serves as evidence that WSU’s compromised position, with what Pollard said on Monday was just $2.5 million in revenue sharing, did indeed bother Rogers. ISU is giving him a pay raise, of course, and, according to Pollard’s Monday comments, about $11.5 million more in revenue sharing to compensate top players. With 75 new players, Rogers and his staff — most of whom followed him from South Dakota State to WSU — put together a respectable 2025 campaign. However, like any breakup, WSU needs to move on and focus on itself and its future. The chance to coach the Cougars in the first years of the new Pac-12, where success almost guarantees a shot at the expanded College Football Playoff, is a real selling point. With WSU firing its athletic director in October, interim AD Jon Haarlow is overseeing the hiring and did not offer a firm timeline in a Sunday news conference. A number of high-profile names are linked to Wazzu. Pac-12 insider John Canzano reported that former UW and UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel has received a call about the job. He has been out of coaching for a while and is currently a TV analyst for CBS. Former Cougar quarterback Luke Falk posted a sincere pitch on social media to be WSU’s next head football coach. The Pac-12’s all-time leading passer has minimal coaching experience, but insisted that he was “the right man for the job.” Another name trending among fans is former WSU linebacker Johnny Nansen. Nansen was a staple of the Palouse Posse defense in the 1990s and is presently Texas’ co-defensive coordinator. His career has taken him to Idaho, UW and USC, among other legacy Pac-12 and Big Sky stops. Whomever the Cougars hire, they would do well to find someone who truly values Pullman and is in it for the long term. Even the great coaches in WSU history, such as Jim Walden (who also left WSU for Iowa State), Mike Price and the late Mike Leach, left WSU for another opportunity, but not before achieving remarkable success over a significant period. The Cougars need a coach who wants to be in Pullman for more than just 1-3 years. WSU’s financial position is not what it was in Leach’s tenure, which has made Jake Dickert’s dart for Wake Forest and Rogers’ relocation to Iowa State sting. This is the state of WSU football, but it doesn’t have to be this way. The right person, who in turn would assemble a team of suitable people, for the right time — the dawn of a revamped Pac-12 — could do wonders for Wazzu. The Cougars just need to find them.

"Dear Abby: I believe in God, but don’t go to church. Am I sinning?","DEAR ABBY: I’m a twice-divorced woman who has no children. I was raised by two deeply religious parents (now deceased) who attended church every Sunday and took me along. I regularly attended church until 15 years ago. At that time, my dad was dying, and I was dating a man I often had brunch and spent time with on Sundays. That man and I broke up 2 1/2 years ago. I’ve recently started thinking I should start back to church. I went once about six weeks ago but haven’t returned. I keep finding excuses not to go, such as I can’t get up early enough on Sunday morning, or I like spending time at home with my cats, or I’m too tired after working all week, etc. I keep wondering how much of my guilt over not going is because of how I was raised, or if it’s just that I think I should go. Is it a sin not to go to church? I’ve never stopped believing in God, I pray and read the Bible occasionally, and I read a daily devotion every morning. This has me so confused. Please advise. -- OUT OF CHURCH IN TENNESSEE DEAR OUT: People attend religious services for various reasons. Some do it because it’s how they were brought up or because they enjoy the sense of community and the sermon. Others do it because they want to be seen. Some churches have strict doctrine, while others are not bound to rigid dogma. In some denominations it may be considered a sin not to go. However, I don’t think you should force yourself to attend a religious service for any reason other than you think you need it. If you believe in God and read a daily devotion every morning, it may be enough for you. DEAR ABBY: I have been divorced from “Joanna” for 30 years, but we remained friends and have two children. I met my girlfriend, “Debbie,” 20 years ago, but seven years went by before we dated. Debbie is 20 years younger than I. She wanted kids and I did not, so she moved on with another man. After a couple years of living alone, and after the death of Joanna’s boyfriend, I allowed Joanna to rent a bedroom in my house. (I needed the money.) A few years later, Debbie and I ended up back together. Debbie wanted to move in, so she did. Now that we have all lived together for a couple years, the only problem we have is Debbie’s attitude about Joanna, who happens to be very pleasant. (Joanna keeps to herself, in her room.) Debbie also has a bad attitude when my kids visit. She makes them feel uncomfortable. I love Debbie, but she is making a simple life difficult for no good reason. What do you advise? -- ONE OF THREE IN CALIFORNIA DEAR ONE: Tell Debbie that Joanna is renting a room in your house because you NEED THE MONEY. Tell her that you don’t like the fact that she makes your kids feel uncomfortable when they visit. Unless she can manage an immediate 180-degree attitude adjustment, she has to leave.

Declarations and rider bookings stand for this meeting, and the time of the first race remains at 11:50am. An energy infrastructure expert is warning households across Ireland to preparem for potential power outages during Storm Bram. Taco Engelaar, Managing Director at energy infrastructure experts Neara comments: ""90mph winds and severe rains dramatically increase the risk of power cuts - meaning households must be prepared for blackouts. The most common causes of power failure are falling trees or branches landing on power lines, high winds that see cables snap or poles topple, and rising flood waters that mean electricity needs to be switched off to keep communities safe. ""As Ireland sees more frequent 'super storms' like Bram, those living in affected areas should make sure they're ready by having a torch and spare batteries to hand, or candles and a supply of matches. Make sure you know exactly where they are. For safety, be sure to turn all ovens and other appliances off if a power cut strikes. And leave one light switched on so you’ll know straight away when the supply is restored. ""Grid operators and utility providers work hard and deploy all sorts of tools, such as drones and AI, to get the power back as quickly as possible. But in severe storms, dangerous conditions mean it can take 48-hours or longer to get electricity running again,"" he added. #StormBram - This is a multi-hazard event - be aware of elevated flood risk & high windsPlease note that changes to timings, locations & intensity may occur through out the day, so keep safe & up to date pic.twitter.com/OSaorLrYhJ Amber weather warning issued Strong winds across western and northern parts of Northern IrelandTuesday 1400 - 1900Latest info #WeatherAware pic.twitter.com/vPbEWcnKb2 Storm Bram incoming this afternoon at the Cliffs of Moher, Doolin, Co.

Bangladeshi Police Officer Proudly Represents Nation in Prestigious International Diploma in Dubai,"Superintendent of Police A.N.M Maruf Abdullah from the Bangladesh Police proudly represented his country at an international level by participating in one of the world’s most prestigious police leadership programmes organised by Dubai Police in the United Arab Emirates. He was selected to join 54 distinguished officers from 38 countries in the second edition of the Police Innovation and Leadership (PIL) Diploma. The programme focused on advanced policing strategies, including digital transformation, artificial intelligence, blockchain applications in forensic science, and modern risk management. “This was more than a training course. It was a life-changing opportunity,” said Supt. Abdullah. “I gained practical knowledge that can be applied directly in Bangladesh, especially in combating cybercrime and financial fraud.” One of the highlights of the programme for him was the final project, which focused on raising public awareness about the dangers of crimes linked to cryptocurrencies. He noted that the experience enhanced his understanding of digital threats and helped him improve his ability to simplify complex information for public communication. The programme, held in partnership with the Rochester Institute of Technology in Dubai, also included leadership development and well-being sessions. Supt. Abdullah explained that he returned home with a sharper strategic mindset, greater confidence in decision-making, and a deeper understanding of the importance of mental and physical balance in policing roles. He expressed pride in carrying the name of Bangladesh to a global platform and sharing space with top police professionals from around the world. “It was an honour to represent my country and to exchange experiences with officers who are shaping the future of global policing,” he said. He also encouraged law enforcement agencies around the world to study Dubai Police’s model, which integrates smart city systems, data analysis, and AI-driven surveillance to strengthen trust, transparency, and community satisfaction. Supt. Abdullah thanked the Government of the United Arab Emirates and Dubai Police for the opportunity to be part of such a significant experience. He stated that the knowledge and inspiration he gained would fuel positive changes in the policing system of Bangladesh. “Dubai Police is not only building a secure future for its own city.

The fight to protect our art and its rights,” Lalit Gandhi, president of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MACCIA), told ThePrint. “This is also proof of the fact that when efforts are put in the right direction, you can win without really fighting.” The excitement in Gandhi’s voice is unmistakable. He admits the victory still hasn’t fully sunk in, but he is pleased with how the battle concluded. Gandhi revealed that Prada will decide whether to extend the contract based on market response. But the goal for him was never to embarrass the brand—it was to secure recognition and benefits for the artisans and restore the value of traditional craft. “Prada’s collaboration will elevate the value of our products. It means our footwear can enter mainstream fashion, not just be the sandals people wear occasionally with kurta-pyjamas or ethnic outfits,” he said. Three-year programme for Indian artisans Prada has signed a formal agreement with two government-backed bodies that promote leather artisanship. The Sant Rohidas Leather Industries & Charmakar Development Corporation Ltd (LIDCOM) from Maharashtra and Dr Babu Jagjivan Ram Leather Industries Development Corporation Ltd (LIDKAR) from Karnataka signed the memorandum of understanding (MoU) on 10 December. The MoU was signed at the Consulate General of Italy in Mumbai, with Lorenzo Bertelli representing the brand. Bertelli is Prada’s chief of marketing and head of corporate social responsibility. The collaboration comes after Prada unveiled a ‘toe-ring sandal’ as part of its Spring/Summer 2026 menswear collection in Milan. The footwear resembled the traditional Kolhapuri, which got a Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2019. The brand didn’t credit the design’s roots. This led to massive outrage on social media. Celebrities such as Kareena Kapoor and Neena Gupta called Prada out on its cultural appropriation. The backlash forced Prada’s technical team to visit Kolhapur and meet with artisans. Now, this partnership will involve artisans producing the sandals using traditional methods from Maharashtra and Karnataka, and the material will be provided by the brand. It will also include a three-year training programme to help Indian artisans upgrade their skills. Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal told PTI that he was pleased that the issue had evolved into a constructive collaboration. According to him, the Kolhapuri chappal market has “the potential to become a billion-dollar export category”.

Among them was Shubham Satpute of Inga Leathers in Subhash Nagar. Satpute, a fourth-generation artisan and trader who also runs his own workshop, gifted the team a pair of Moje Puda Kapshi sandals, the very design for which Prada has now signed a formal agreement. “A world-famous brand choosing to collaborate with us is a matter of pride for everyone, from the shopkeepers to the artisans. They have given the recognition to the sandal, we are satisfied,” Satpute said. Jaydatt, who operates a small Kolhapuri sandal stall in the famous Chappal Market of Shivaji Chowk, said the shopkeepers spent hours discussing how their collective effort had finally paid off. But some remain unsure about whether the partnership will translate into direct gains for them. “We are happy about the collaboration, but we still don’t fully understand how it will benefit us. We are waiting for some communication from the government. That said, the fact that Prada acknowledged their mistake and changed the name is also significant for us,” he said. For Satpute, however, the bigger expectation lies in the boost this partnership could bring to the domestic market. He believes the impact within India will surpass that of exports. “The sandal will suddenly be seen as a luxury item, and it will become cool to wear. We’re expecting a 20-30 per cent jump in domestic sales alone,” Satpute said confidently. He further explained why he believes the surge is imminent. Ever since the Kolhapuri sandal controversy gained national attention and journalists visited the city, sales saw an immediate spike. Leather prices have risen by 20-25 per cent over the past few months, and labour costs have increased by 10-20 per cent. Satpute notes that until winter arrived, he had barely found time to rest. For him, this partnership is a lesson not just for global brands, but for Indian artisans as well. “An artisan’s work cannot simply be copied and sold. You can draw inspiration—the world runs on inspiration—but giving credit matters. And we have proved it.” (Edited by Prasanna Bachchhav) “We have won this fight. The fight to protect our art and its rights,” Lalit Gandhi, president of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MACCIA), told ThePrint. “This is also proof of the fact that when efforts are put in the right direction, you can win without really fighting.” The excitement in Gandhi’s voice is unmistakable. He admits the victory still hasn’t fully sunk in, but he is pleased with how the battle concluded. Gandhi revealed that Prada will decide whether to extend the contract based on market response. But the goal for him was never to embarrass the brand—it was to secure recognition and benefits for the artisans and restore the value of traditional craft. “Prada’s collaboration will elevate the value of our products. It means our footwear can enter mainstream fashion, not just be the sandals people wear occasionally with kurta-pyjamas or ethnic outfits,” he said. Three-year programme for Indian artisans Prada has signed a formal agreement with two government-backed bodies that promote leather artisanship. The Sant Rohidas Leather Industries & Charmakar Development Corporation Ltd (LIDCOM) from Maharashtra and Dr Babu Jagjivan Ram Leather Industries Development Corporation Ltd (LIDKAR) from Karnataka signed the memorandum of understanding (MoU) on 10 December. The MoU was signed at the Consulate General of Italy in Mumbai, with Lorenzo Bertelli representing the brand. Bertelli is Prada’s chief of marketing and head of corporate social responsibility. The collaboration comes after Prada unveiled a ‘toe-ring sandal’ as part of its Spring/Summer 2026 menswear collection in Milan. The footwear resembled the traditional Kolhapuri, which got a Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2019. The brand didn’t credit the design’s roots. This led to massive outrage on social media. Celebrities such as Kareena Kapoor and Neena Gupta called Prada out on its cultural appropriation. The backlash forced Prada’s technical team to visit Kolhapur and meet with artisans. Now, this partnership will involve artisans producing the sandals using traditional methods from Maharashtra and Karnataka, and the material will be provided by the brand. It will also include a three-year training programme to help Indian artisans upgrade their skills.

And we have proved it.” (Edited by Prasanna Bachchhav) Satpute, a fourth-generation artisan and trader who also runs his own workshop, gifted the team a pair of Moje Puda Kapshi sandals, the very design for which Prada has now signed a formal agreement. “A world-famous brand choosing to collaborate with us is a matter of pride for everyone, from the shopkeepers to the artisans. They have given the recognition to the sandal, we are satisfied,” Satpute said. Jaydatt, who operates a small Kolhapuri sandal stall in the famous Chappal Market of Shivaji Chowk, said the shopkeepers spent hours discussing how their collective effort had finally paid off. But some remain unsure about whether the partnership will translate into direct gains for them. “We are happy about the collaboration, but we still don’t fully understand how it will benefit us. We are waiting for some communication from the government. That said, the fact that Prada acknowledged their mistake and changed the name is also significant for us,” he said. For Satpute, however, the bigger expectation lies in the boost this partnership could bring to the domestic market. He believes the impact within India will surpass that of exports. “The sandal will suddenly be seen as a luxury item, and it will become cool to wear. We’re expecting a 20-30 per cent jump in domestic sales alone,” Satpute said confidently. He further explained why he believes the surge is imminent. Ever since the Kolhapuri sandal controversy gained national attention and journalists visited the city, sales saw an immediate spike. Leather prices have risen by 20-25 per cent over the past few months, and labour costs have increased by 10-20 per cent. Satpute notes that until winter arrived, he had barely found time to rest.

"'Super flu' is posing threat to NHS unlike any since Covid pandemic, warns Wes Streeting","News | Politics Get our award-winning daily news email featuring exclusive stories, opinion and expert analysis I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice. Flu is tearing through London’s hospitals, Wes Streeting is warning as he urged doctors to call off their five-day strike to protect the NHS in the run-up to Christmas. The Health Secretary issued his plea as latest figures showed flu hospitalisation cases in the capital had jumped 47% in just a week. Mr Streeting told The Standard: ""There is a tidal wave of flu tearing through our London hospitals with hundreds of beds in the capital filled with flu patients – the highest recorded at this time of year. “I have seen the damage flu is doing in my local hospitals and it isn’t acceptable for patients.” The MP for Ilford North added: “With hospital beds, ambulances and A&Es in London filling up with patients, the whole NHS team is working around the clock to keep our families safe. “I’m urging resident doctors to call off strike action, this Christmas, which would come at the worst possible time.” The Health Secretary stressed: “The offer I have made to the BMA would help solve the jobs problem resident doctors are facing, and I hope resident doctors will vote to accept it and stay with the rest of the NHS team on the frontline this Christmas.” There were 380 people with flu in London hospitals on average each day in the week ending December 7, compared to 259 the previous week. Some nurses, doctors and other NHS staff are also off work after catching the virus. Mr Streeting has warned flu cases may triple in coming weeks and that the strike could be “the Jenga piece” that topples the work of hospitals to deliver care during the Christmas period. The latest walkout by resident doctors, previously known as junior doctors, will take place from 7am next Wednesday, December 17, until December 22. London has a high number of resident doctors due to having many teaching hospitals. Speaking on LBC on Friday morning, Mr Streeting said: “The flu pressures we're seeing on the NHS at the moment, this is probably the worst pressure the NHS has faced since Covid. “There is a lot of flu around and there is a particularly aggressive strain that's knocking people out and is leading to not just to people turning up at hospital, but even being admitted to hospital. King to share 'personal message' about cancer recovery in Channel 4 broadcast Wes Streeting ‘not comfortable’ with puberty blocker clinical trial School site in east London to close amid capital's pupil exodus crisis The best destinations and activities to book this winter “Now, if we didn't have strikes looming over us, I would be extremely worried about that situation. This is always a hard time for the NHS in the run up to Christmas and the first week of the New Year, we could just about cope with that. “The idea that we will have to contend with that plus strikes is dangerous and I am extremely worried about the pressure on staff, but more seriously, the risk to patients if we end up with that double whammy of both flu and strikes.” Mr Streeting has made a new offer to end the industrial action which the BMA is putting to its members. The doctors’ union said the new offer includes new legislation to ensure homegrown doctors in training have priority for speciality training roles, an increase in speciality training posts over the next three years, with 1,000 of these to start in 2026, and funding mandatory examination and Royal College membership fees for resident doctors. The looming industrial action will be the 14th walkout since the long-running pay dispute started in March 2023, and comes after an earlier five-day walkout in mid-November. Resident doctors received pay rises totalling 22% in 2023 and 2024, and this year got an additional 5.4%. But the BMA argues that resident doctors’ pay is 20% lower in real terms than it was in 2008, even after the 2025 increase. The 380 figure for flu patients in general and acute hospital beds in London is around triple the 133 for the same period last year, highlighting how the super flu has hit London early and ripped through the city. At the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust in north London there were 50 patients with flu on December 7, compared to 19 a week earlier. At Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust there was a rise from 30 to 49 over the same period. In south London, there was an increase from 17 to 39 at Croydon Health Services NHS Trust, and from 21 to 31 at Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust. At the Whittington Health NHS Trust in north London there was a rise from four to 26. Dr Chris Streather, medical director for the NHS in London has stressed: “With record demand for A&E and ambulances and an impending resident doctors’ strike, this unprecedented wave of super flu is leaving the NHS facing a worst-case scenario for this time of year.” Some 1.8 million people in London have already had the flu vaccine. But health chiefs are urging Londoners who have not yet had the jab to get it. People aged 65 and over, pregnant women, children and individuals with certain health conditions can get the vaccine free on the NHS. Health bosses are urging people to stay at home if they have flu-like symptoms rather than risk spreading the virus on the Tube, trains, buses and in the workplace. They also stress that people who have a cough or are sneezing should not go to Christmas parties in case they have flu and would then pass it on to family, friends or colleagues. Londoners can get the vaccine at a number of walk-in centres or events across the capital, including in the hours before kick-off for fans attending the AFC Wimbledon v Mansfield Town match at Plough Lane, Wimbledon, this Saturday (December 13). They can also walk into pharmacies and have their flu jab on the day, with 757 sites offering this service on the NHS walk-in finder.
