Here's CBA's latest Australian interest rate forecast,"Image source: Getty Images You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More If you've been hoping for another RBA interest rate cut this year, the economists at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) have some bad news for you. CBA revised its outlook for rate relief Down Under following yesterday's widely unexpected surge in inflation. News which sent the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) into a tailspin in early afternoon trade on Wednesday. The prospect of ASX 200 investors or Aussie mortgage holders seeing another 2025 interest rate cut from the RBA all but vanished yesterday after the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicator rose 1.3% in the September quarter and 3.2% annually. That marks the highest quarterly inflation increase since March 2023 and was well ahead of market expectations. The annual inflation print was the highest level since the June 2024 quarter. As for trimmed mean annual inflation, which removes certain volatile items and is the metric favoured by the RBA, it came in at 3% for the September quarter, up from 2.7% in the June quarter. This was the first time trimmed mean annual inflation rose since December 2022, and it came in well above the RBA's forecast of 2.6%. Which brings us to… Commenting on the surprise surge in inflation, Belinda Allen, head of Australian economics at CBA, said, ""This result will be a genuine concern for the RBA. We expect the central bank to take a more hawkish tone to avoid a return to higher inflation."" The RBA meets next week and announces its interest rate decision on Tuesday. As for that upcoming meeting, CBA said, ""We expect the cash rate to be held steady at 3.60%."" Unfortunately for ASX investors patiently waiting until 2026 for the next rate cuts, CBA also believes those are off the table for now. According to the ASX 200 bank: Given the material upside surprise to the Q3 25 CPI, and the broad-based nature of pricing pressures, we now expect the RBA to remain on hold from here. Previously we expected one last rate cut in February 2026 to bring the cash rate back closer to neutral. So, what will it take for Aussie to get some rate relief? ""We expect it would take a material move higher in the unemployment rate, together with more moderate inflation prints, to bring the RBA back to the cutting table,"" CBA said. Could, gasp, the next RBA interest rate move actually be higher? According to CBA, that's certainly a possibility, with the bank noting ""the latest data has tilted the risks to the upside"". CBA concluded, ""If inflation remains elevated in 2026, as we expect it could, the RBA may need to act.""",2025-10-30 04:39:40,Fool Australia,neutral,0.849,2,Demand_Spending_Industry
"Business : Xi Jinping Urges Partnership With Us, Says Frictions Are 'normal' Between Economic Powers","KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 30 (Bernama) -- China and the United States (US) should be partners and friends, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his meeting with his counterpart Donald Trump at the Gimhae Air Base in Busan, South Korea, while stating that it is normal for two economic powerhouses to have frictions at times. Trump called Xi a great leader, “President Xi is a great leader of a great country, and I think we are going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it is an honour to have you with us. Thank you very much.” Xi said, “China’s relations have remained stable on the whole (and) given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then and in the face of winds, waves and challenges.” “You and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course and ensure the steady sailing forward of the giant ship of China-US relations. I always believe that China’s development goes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again,” he said in the video that was streamed live by The White House. Xi said both leaders have spoken over the phone three times, exchanged several letters, and stayed in close contact since Trump’s re-election. He said both Beijing and Washington are fully able to help each other succeed and prosper together. “Over the years, I have stated in public many times that China and the US should be partners and friends. This is what history has taught us and what reality demands,” Xi said. Xi said that in the latest round of consultation, both economic and trade teams have reached a basic consensus on addressing respective major concerns and made encouraging progress. Earlier in his opening remarks, Trump also mentioned the consensus that has been reached. “I think we have already agreed to a lot of things, and we will agree to some more right now,” said Trump. Xi said the consensus provided the necessary conditions for their meeting today. He said, “Mr President, I am ready to continue working with you to build a solid foundation for China-US relations and create a sound atmosphere for the development of both countries.” Meanwhile, Trump also said Xi is a “very tough negotiator”, and a China-US trade deal could be signed between the two countries. Xi also expressed his appreciation for Trump’s contribution to the recent conclusion of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. “Mr President, you care a lot about world peace, and you are very enthusiastic about settling various regional hotspot issues. I appreciate your great contribution to the recent conclusion of the Gaza ceasefire agreement,” he said. The Chinese President also mentioned the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord, signed in Kuala Lumpur by Cambodia and Thailand. He said China has been helping, in its own way, for both countries to settle their border disputes, and that it has also been promoting peace talks to resolve other hotspot issues. “The world today is confronted with many tough problems. China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world,” he said. Both leaders are in South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Week, which is taking place in Gyeongju, a coastal city. Malaysia is a founding member of APEC, an intergovernmental forum comprising 21 economies. Collectively, the APEC economies contribute approximately 61 per cent of global gross domestic product and 46 per cent of world trade, underscoring their pivotal role in driving international economic growth and integration. With a population exceeding three billion, the APEC region continues to serve as a key engine of global development and is projected to expand by 2.9 per cent in 2026, reflecting its resilience and enduring economic potential. -- BERNAMA BERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.

All about glass bead art,"African glass bead art has been a part of cultural expression for centuries, combining traditional techniques with modern aesthetics. This art form has evolved, yet retained its roots, showcasing the rich heritage and creativity of African artisans. From intricate patterns to vibrant colors, glass bead art continues to captivate audiences worldwide. Here are five fascinating aspects of this unique artistic tradition. #1 Glass beads have been a part of African culture since ancient times. They were used for trade, adornment, and spiritual purposes. The introduction of European-made glass beads in the 15th century revolutionized the industry, making them more accessible. Today, these beads are still used in traditional ceremonies and contemporary fashion alike. #2 The art of bead-making is passed down generations, with artisans perfecting their craft over the years. Traditional techniques include melting raw materials and shaping them into small spheres or tubes. Modern innovations have introduced new colors and shapes, but the basic methods remain largely unchanged. #3 Each design in African glass bead art carries cultural significance. Patterns may depict social status, tribal affiliation, or personal identity. Colors also have meanings; for example, red may symbolize strength, while blue could represent peace. Understanding these symbols adds depth to appreciating this art form. #4 The production and sale of glass beads provide a source of income for many communities across Africa. Artisans often work in cooperatives that support fair trade practices and sustainable development initiatives. The global demand for authentic African beadwork helps preserve this tradition while contributing to local economies. #5 In recent years, there has been a resurgence in popularity for African glass bead jewelry among fashion enthusiasts around the world. Designers are incorporating these vibrant pieces into modern wardrobes, highlighting their versatility as both statement accessories and subtle embellishments. This trend not only celebrates cultural heritage but also encourages ethical consumerism through supporting artisan communities.",2025-10-30 04:38:32,Newsbytes,positive,0.8043,0,Economy_Prosperity_Sector
"Fed Meeting: Second Rate Cut Of The Year Announced, Benchmark Rates Lowered By 0.25%","The U.S. Federal Reserve just cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percent, which lines up with what most people on Wall Street expected. It's the second time they've trimmed rates this year, dropping the policy range to 3.75 to 4 percent. The vote wasn't unanimous either—out of twelve members, ten wanted this cut, one didn’t want any change, and another actually wanted an even bigger cut of 0.5 percent. The Fed didn’t give much of a hint about what they're planning for December. Back in September, they said there could be three more cuts in 2025, but for now, everyone’s waiting for the next meeting in December. After the announcement, markets bounced around—stocks jumped at first, then got shaky after the Fed Chair made his comments. So, what does the Fed say about the economy? In their official statement, they said things are still growing, but not too fast. Job growth is slowing down, and unemployment has ticked up a bit, though it’s still low. Inflation is higher than it was at the start of the year and isn’t coming down yet. The Fed keeps pointing to its two big goals: keeping unemployment low and hitting that 2 percent inflation target. Lately, with job risks creeping up, they decided a 0.25 percent rate cut was the right move to balance things out. They’re keeping a close eye on economic trends and global issues before making any more decisions. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke, markets got even more jittery. He said there’s a lot of disagreement inside the Fed about what to do in December, and it’s just too soon to say if there will be another cut this year. Stocks, which had gone up right after the rate cut, quickly lost those gains as investors digested his remarks. One more wrinkle: a government shutdown has held up a bunch of important economic reports. Even with some data missing, the Fed said they had enough information from both public and private sources to make the call. The shutdown has made it harder for agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect data. The White House warned that if this drags on, key inflation reports could be delayed, which could mess with how everyone judges the economy.",2025-10-30 04:38:10,The Free Press Journal,neutral,0.5975,2,Demand_Spending_Industry
"Asian Stocks Erase Gains After Trump-Xi Talks, Yen Falls: Markets Wrap","US equity-index futures erased gains and Asian shares lost momentum after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping ended their summit that was aimed at easing the trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Contracts for the S&P 500 were flat after the underlying gauge erased gains following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s warning that a rate cut in December isn’t a foregone conclusion. Asian shares gave up earlier gains to trade 0.1% lower. The technology sector remained in focus after Samsung Electronics Co.’s earnings beat estimates, and megacap US companies boosted bets on the artificial intelligence theme. The yen fluctuated against the dollar after the Bank of Japan held its policy rate. Gold was flat after four days of declines, while a gauge of the dollar trimmed gains from the prior session. Treasuries recouped some of their losses with the yield on the 10-year declining one basis point to 4.06%. Markets are looking past the Fed’s cautious stance on further rate cuts and turning their focus to the ongoing Trump–Xi meeting, which investors hope will ease the world’s largest trade dispute and steady global markets after months of tension. The artificial intelligence theme and spending by megacap companies were also in focus as big technology names started reporting earnings. Trump earlier said the US and China “could” sign a trade deal Thursday as the two leaders started a high-stakes meeting. The two leaders were set to finalise a détente at their South Korea meeting to put the world’s biggest trade fight on hold — at least for now. Earlier, following the Fed’s expected rate cut, Powell’s caution about future moves and his focus on labor market risks led investors to scale back easing bets. Fed officials delivered their second straight rate reduction Wednesday to support a softening labor market, and said they would stop shrinking the portfolio of assets on Dec. 1. Governor Stephen Miran dissented again in favor of a larger reduction. Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid said he preferred not to cut rates at all. Investors also got a chance to price in tech companies spending on artificial intelligence after earnings from megacaps. Three bellwethers – Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — together racked up some $78 billion in capital expenditures last quarter. That’s up 89% from a year earlier. Their earnings were mixed. Meta Platforms shares fell 7.4% in extended trading while Alphabet jumped 6.7%. Microsoft fell almost 4%. Earlier in the US trading day, Nvidia Corp. became the first company to reach $5 trillion in market valuation. “Even though the Fed communication was more hawkish than the market had expected, the news of Nvidia’s market cap exceeding $5 trillion and Alphabet’s favorable earnings announcement are supporting tech-related stocks in Asia,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. Some of the main moves in markets: S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% as of 1:16 p.m. Tokyo time Japan’s Topix rose 0.3% Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.5% Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.5% The Shanghai Composite was little changed Euro Stoxx 50 futures rose 0.2% The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1% The euro rose 0.2% to $1.1625 The Japanese yen was little changed at 152.74 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.0957 per dollar Bitcoin fell 1.4% to $109,904.42 Ether fell 1.8% to $3,881.47 The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 4.06% Japan’s 10-year yield was unchanged at 1.655% Australia’s 10-year yield advanced seven basis points to 4.29% West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.4% to $60.22 a barrel Spot gold rose 0.3% to $3,942.76 an ounce",2025-10-30 04:37:12,Ndtv Profit,neutral,0.7247,-1,Outlier

"‘Friction Is Natural, But Ties Must Stay On Track’: Xi Jinping Urges Trump For China-US Partnership","Chinese President Xi Jinping met his American counterpart Donald Trump in South Korea on Thursday, marking their first meeting in six years. During the talks, Xi emphasised that Beijing and Washington must remain partners and friends, acknowledging that differences were “natural” but urging both nations to stay on the “right course.” “It is natural to have friction,” Xi said, adding, “China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish more great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world.” He also expressed appreciation for Trump’s efforts to promote peace in ongoing global conflicts, reiterating China’s willingness to continue working with the United States. In response, President Trump described Xi as “a great leader of a great country,” adding, “I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it's an honour to have you with us.” The two leaders met at an air base in the southern port city of Busan, with the encounter taking place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. This was also the first meeting since Trump’s return to office in January this year. As the two leaders shook hands, Trump remarked, “We are going to have a very successful meeting, I have no doubt. But he is a very tough negotiator.” The meeting came against the backdrop of renewed US-China trade tensions, which have persisted since 2018. The dispute reignited earlier this month after China proposed expanding curbs on exports of rare-earth minerals, a key component for high-tech manufacturing where Beijing holds global dominance. In response, Trump announced plans to impose additional 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods and hinted at further restrictions on exports involving US software - a move that analysts warned could severely disrupt the global economy. Following urgent negotiations between senior officials, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Beijing might delay the rare-earth export restrictions for a year and resume purchases of US soybeans, a vital export for American farmers. Just ahead of the APEC Summit, Reuters reported that China had bought its first cargoes of US soybeans in several months, signalling tentative progress towards easing trade tensions.

Euro zone growth beats forecasts as France outperforms,"The euro zone economy grew quicker than expected last quarter as buoyant consumption offset faltering exports and persistent struggles in Germany's oversized industrial sector, fresh data from Eurostat showed on Thursday. The economy of the 20 nations sharing the euro expanded by 0.2% in the third quarter, beating expectations for a 0.1% increase in a Reuters poll, with France and Spain growing well above average, balancing out stagnation in Germany and Italy. On an annualised basis, the economy grew by 1.3%, ahead of expectations for 1.2%, a level economists consider to be around its natural rate of growth without stimulus. Spain remained the best performer among the bloc's largest economies, growing by 0.6% on the quarter, in line with forecasts, while France expanded by 0.5%, beating expectations for 0.2%. Germany and Italy meanwhile both stagnated. Thursday's figures ease pressure on the ECB to cut interest rates any further in the near term as they confirm the bank's long standing view that the economy is proving resilient to this year's unusual spike in uncertainty. While trade tensions, lingering uncertainty and Chinese dumping of surplus goods could still weigh on growth in the months ahead, economists remain relatively upbeat about the outlook and ECB projections suggest that last quarter may have been the worst for some time. Growth could pick up as past interest rate cuts work their way through the economy, households sit on ample saving, Germany boosts spending, uncertainty over tariffs eases and inventories have already run low. Indeed business activity, measured by a key purchasing managers survey, is already showing a pick up, sentiment in Germany, the bloc's biggest nation, is improving and business are becoming more optimistic, partly over lower tariff uncertainty. But any growth pick up is likely to be modest as the rigid structure of the euro zone economy limits activity, say economists, who predict growth in the 1.2% to 1.5% range for years to come.

Marcos leaves for APEC meet in South Korea,"(UPDATE) PRESIDENT Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday departed for South Korea to participate in the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ Meeting, where he will promote the Philippines and push for stronger regional trade and investment ties. Marcos left Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on board the presidential plane with first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos for the summit scheduled from Oct. 30 to Nov. 2 in Gyeongju, South Korea. In his departure statement, Marcos said the growth and stability of the Asia-Pacific region were directly tied to the opportunities and welfare of all Filipinos, as the region accounts for nearly 46 percent of global trade in goods and commercial services, and generates around 61 percent of global gross domestic product. “So, given these high stakes, this gathering is imperative. We convene at a critical juncture, defined by evolving geopolitical landscapes, supply chain disruptions, threats of climate change, and the urgent need for equitable and inclusive growth,” Marcos said. Citing the theme of this year’s APEC gathering, “Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect. Innovate. Prosper,” Marcos said the Philippines was committed to accelerate physical and digital connectivity, as well as digital transformation for competitiveness, and ensure stable and equitable prosperity for all Filipinos. “Our collaboration with the Republic of Korea and all APEC economies is pivotal. We will forge deeper ties around our shared goals and objectives, including fostering AI-driven innovation, enhancing cultural and creative industries, and proactively addressing demographic challenges,” the president said. “This collective resolve will ensure that our development efforts align with regional progress, laying the groundwork for a future where the power of creativity, technology and sustainability benefits every Filipino,” he added. Marcos said his engagements with the leaders of economies in the Asia-Pacific region would focus on “actionable areas” consistent with his administration’s long-term vision under AmBisyon 2040. He said these areas were guaranteeing equitable access to digital services and financial inclusion, particularly in underserved rural areas; advancing seamless movement of goods and people through investment facilitation and infrastructure development; promoting supply chain resiliency amid shocks and crises; and promoting digital literacy and skills development for micro, small and medium enterprises, women, and other segments who can realize their full economic potential through digitalization. The president said he was scheduled to address the APEC CEO Summit, an annual gathering of top CEOs in the region, where he would showcase the Philippines’ commitment to fostering economic partnerships and promoting a favorable business climate, aligned with the government’s vision of building a strong, innovation-driven economy. “Among others, we will highlight how we are pursuing digital transformation as a core pillar of our development, fully recognizing the potential of new technologies to unlock a more prosperous and resilient future,” said Marcos, who is heading to the APEC meetings after a four-day visit in Malaysia for the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Summit and Related Summits. Coming from the 47th Asean Summit, the president said he would lobby for stronger collaboration with regional partners, including Asean, to achieve the shared objectives for a sustainable, technologically empowered and inclusive future. “As the chair[man] of Asean in 2026, our goal is to impart that working silos impede the region’s potential. Real growth and lasting prosperity are achievable when we break down barriers, share knowledge, and collaborate across sectors, industries and communities,” he said. On the sidelines of the APEC meetings, President Marcos will meet with South Korean business leaders to deepen trade ties, attract investments and strengthen people-to-people cooperation. “I want to use this moment to reaffirm a core truth to the international business community: The Philippines is not merely ready. We are a reliable, forward-looking partner in the Asia-Pacific. Invest in the Filipino,” he said. Marcos also looked forward to meeting the Filipino community in Busan for the first time, where Filipinos thrive and make meaningful contributions to the city’s socioeconomic growth and further strengthen the enduring people-to-people ties between the Philippines and South Korea. Meanwhile, Marcos said that the ongoing meeting between United States President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would influence discussions at APEC, saying any agreement between the two economic powers would have global ripple effects. “The world is watching because this is the source of the largest shock that has entered into the world trade system. And we have to see what the agreements will be coming out of these meetings between President Xi and President Trump,” Marcos said. “Those will certainly color everything that we will be talking about in this APEC because the agreements or the arrangements that are made between two of the largest economies of the world will certainly affect every single citizen of the world,” he added. Trump kicked off a meeting with Xi at a South Korean air base on Thursday, optimistic about striking a trade-war truce between the world’s two largest economies. “We are going to have a very successful meeting, I have no doubt. But he is a very tough negotiator,” Trump said, as he shook hands with Xi. A few days ago, trade negotiators for both countries reached a “fundamental consensus on addressing each other’s primary concerns,” Xi said. “I am willing to continue working with President Trump to lay a solid foundation for China-US relations,” he added. During the president’s trip, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin will head the three-man government caretaker committee, with Agrarian Reform Secretary Conrado Estrella III and Education Secretary Sonny Angara as members. Part of Marcos’ delegation are Presidential Communications Acting Secretary Dave Gomez, Foreign Affairs Secretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro, Trade Secretary Cristina Roque, Migrant Workers Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac, Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick Go, and Palace Press Officer Claire Castro. Established in 1989, the regional economic forum aims to harness the growing interdependence of the Asia-Pacific region to promote greater prosperity for its people. Marcos’ attendance this year marks his return to the summit after skipping last year’s meeting in Peru to focus on the government’s disaster response efforts.",2025-10-30 04:48:12,The Manila Times,neutral,0.5849,0,Economy_Prosperity_Sector
Giving stalling car industry a break on petrol-engine ban could be a mistake,"A law banning petrol and diesel engines in new cars by 2035, supposed to be one of the main planks of Europe’s ambitious green agenda, has become the latest front in a Brussels tug of war between climate and industrial policy. The law is part of the European Union’s efforts to become climate neutral by the middle of the century, by phasing out polluting cars and encouraging people to switch to greener electric vehicles (EVs). You will still be able to buy second-hand petrol or diesel cars after 2035, but new vehicles coming off the manufacturing lines will have to be battery-powered. The combustion engine ban, which was approved by the European Parliament and national governments two years ago, is in the sights of the stalling car industry. Volkswagen, BMW and other big German carmakers, which Berlin has rowed in behind, are looking for leeway on the deadline and specific carveouts. The fight cuts across several big questions policymakers are wrestling with: climate targets, the level of regulation from Brussels, Europe’s sluggish economy and the threat of China eating the EU’s lunch. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, whose “green deal” reforms introduced the 2035 engine ban during her first term at the helm of the EU’s powerful executive body, is under pressure to walk it back. The commission president has promised a review of the ban by the end of this year, which is expected to outline proposed changes. German chancellor Friedrich Merz is on a mission to strip back EU regulations he views as a burden on European industry. The plan to stop any new carbon dioxide-emitting cars being produced in 10 years is at the top of his list. There, he has a friend in Manfred Weber, the conservative German MEP who leads the European People’s Party (EPP), the centre-right grouping that dominates the European Parliament. Merz, Weber and von der Leyen all belong to the same political family in German politics, a home constituency the commission president can’t be seen to ignore. Definitely not when Germany’s industrial engine – the auto sector – is feeling the financial pinch and laying off workers. The review of the combustion engine ban will have to be a tidy piece of politics. Von der Leyen needs to give something to the car industry, but still hang on to the broad ambition of her legislation. That something might be scope for the car industry to keep producing hybrids, with both electric and combustion engines, beyond 2035, or a delay in the cut-off. Promising more help to car manufacturers developing their EV battery supply in Europe could be another sweetener. Giorgia Meloni’s hard-right Italian government has lined up beside Germany in opposition to the 2035 ban. The French and Spanish governments have been fighting a rearguard action in defence of the EU pivot to electric vehicles. A paper authored by France and Spain, circulated to diplomats in Brussels last week, said Europe didn’t stand a chance of hitting its climate targets if it failed to gradually get people to shift away from petrol and diesel cars. The paper, seen by The Irish Times, called for the review to “preserve the 2035 cap” and the environmental ambition behind it. The two big countries said that did not mean the auto industry could not be allowed some “flexibilities” to smooth its transition to EV production, but any leeway needed to be contingent on companies manufacturing their cars in Europe, not abroad. Ban or no ban, Europe is up against the clock to produce affordable electric vehicles. China is making moves to take over as much of the market as it can. Beijing has pumped huge amounts of state resources into industries it thinks will dominate the coming decades, from renewable energy to artificial intelligence and electric and self-driving vehicles. Trade hawks in the European Commission are concerned that China is halfway around the track and Europe is still lacing up its runners. The danger is that Chinese-made EVs, manufactured by say BYD, can seriously undercut European competitors on price, over time snuffing out domestic EV production here and leaving Europe reliant on China for its cars. Last year, the EU slapped defensive tariffs on imports of EVs from China to compensate for what the commission deemed to be an unfair leg-up Beijing gives its industry, which was allowing Chinese manufacturers to flood the European market. Pushing out the 2035 cut-off point for petrol and diesel engines might give European car manufacturers a break in the short term, but it won’t help them catch up to their Chinese rivals in the electric vehicle race.",2025-10-30 04:48:00,The Irish Times,neutral,0.7866,3,Inflation_Forecasts_Investment
Labor Slashes Regional Funding Again,"The Regional Development Victoria (RDV) annual report has revealed grants have been cut by $15 million, or 11 per cent, compared to the previous year. Four years ago, RDV had a total grants pool of $370 million to support development in the regions. Last year, it was just $118 million – a 70 per cent drop. But what is just as damning is the staffing wages bill at RDV. Employee expenses in the last financial year totalled $27.9 million – up 17 per cent from $23 million the previous year. To put it simply, regional Victorians are paying more for public servants, but getting less in return in development grants. Leader of The Nationals and Shadow Minister for Regional Development and Liveability, Danny O’Brien, said Labor is continuing to ignore regional Victorians. “The great divide continues. Labor is leaving regional Victorians out in the cold,” Mr O’Brien said. “It is impossible to justify a 70 per cent cut in grants for regional development across the past four years. “These grants are so important in supporting jobs, infrastructure and helping local economies flourish and thrive.” Mr O’Brien also questioned the staffing cost blow-out. “If RDV is delivering less grants and programs, why is it spending more in wages? Clearly, there’s less work to do,” Mr O’Brien said. “This is a double-edged sword. Regional Victorians are receiving less and paying more for the privilege because Labor can’t manage money.”",2025-10-30 04:47:44,The National Tribune,negative,0.6846,0,Economy_Prosperity_Sector
"Trump, Xi talks wrap up with outcome unclear","China has agreed to keep rare earth exports flowing to the world as part of a one-year agreement, President Donald Trump said on Thursday shortly after meeting his counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea. The agreement, which Trump provided few details about except that it would probably be extended, would ""settle"" the issue, he said. China has yet to comment on what was agreed by the two leaders in talks, which ran for almost two hours. ""All of the rare earth has been settled,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. ""And that's for the world, worldwide, you could say this was a worldwide situation, not just a U.S. situation."" ""There is no roadblock at all on rare earth. That will hopefully disappear from our vocabulary for a little while."" Rare earths, 17 elements which play tiny but vital roles in cars, planes and weapons, have emerged from obscurity to become China's most potent source of leverage in its trade war with the United States. Export controls introduced in April caused widespread shortages overseas, especially for magnets, forcing some automakers to pause production before exports rebounded following deals between Beijing and Washington and the European Union to free up the flow. China expanded those controls again in October, taking the total number of elements restricted to 12 and adding much of the equipment used to process them. The expanded controls are set to come into force in early November and it is unclear whether the agreement discussed by Trump covers the full suite of China's rare earth export controls or just the October extension. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, also on the flight, said China would not be imposing its proposed rare earth controls after an understanding between the presidents. He did not comment on controls that are already in place.",2025-10-30 04:47:02,The Korea Times,neutral,0.7463,1,Economic_Economies_Korea

Instant View: Market analysts react to Trump-Xi meeting,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump held talks with China's Xi Jinping at a South Korean air base on Thursday, with both leaders sounding optimistic about cooling trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. Market reaction was fairly muted as investors awaited further details of any agreement with Chinese stocks holding steady near a 10-year peak. Here are some comments from market analysts and investors: TARECK HORCHANI, HEAD OF DEALING, PRIME BROKERAGE, MAYBANK SECURITIES, SINGAPORE: ""The U.S.–China trade truce is likely to be greeted as a relief rally rather than a structural reset. When such truces occur, one of the first areas both sides highlight is agriculture, a politically sensitive sector in the U.S. where farmers form a key constituency. ""Overall, this looks like a tactical pause rather than a strategic breakthrough, with underlying tensions in technology, supply chains and rare earths still unresolved."" DICKIE WONG, HEAD OF RESEARCH, KINGSTON SECURITIES, HONG KONG: ""I don't see there's any major optimistic surprise at this point, both for the markets and the U.S.-China talks. It's still that same question - after the meeting ends, does it really mean the two countries will have a joint statement, and then the U.S. will roll back all tariffs on China, drop tech curbs, and China will export rare earths again? I don't see any possibility. ""The markets have already priced in much of the positives and there could be an 'anti-climax' development."" MUHAMMAD SAIFUDDIN BIN SAPUAN, ECONOMIST, KENANGA INVESTMENT BANK, KUALA LUMPUR: ""I think this is a tactical pause rather than a structural shift as both likely aim to ease tensions. But the truce will help stabilise global sentiment and trade expectations in the short term, which offers a relief for global demand and supply chain. ""Nevertheless, we still think that structural decoupling between the U.S. and China will continue to shape the long-term outlook.""

5-year wait ends: Bengaluru’s delayed Hosakerehalli flyover finally set to open in November,"The long-delayed Hosakerehalli flyover on Outer Ring Road (ORR), near PES College in southwest Bengaluru, is finally nearing completion and is expected to open to traffic by mid-November. The 500-metre structure was planned to ease congestion at one of the city’s busiest junctions but has faced repeated delays since its launch. The project began in August 2020 with an initial deadline of just 15 months. However, more than five years, around 64 months have passed since then. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) faced criticism for the prolonged delay, prompting the recently formed Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) to issue a 15-day ultimatum for completion, as per a report by Times of India (TOI).

Trump cuts China tariffs to 47pc after ‘amazing’ Xi meeting,"BUSAN, Oct 30 — US President Donald Trump said today he had agreed to reduce tariffs on China to 47 per cent in exchange for Beijing resuming US soybean purchases, keeping rare earths exports flowing and cracking down on the illicit trade of fentanyl. His remarks after face-to-face talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the South Korean city of Busan, their first since 2019, marked the finale of Trump’s whirlwind Asia trip on which he also touted trade breakthroughs with South Korea, Japan and South-east Asian nations. “I thought it was an amazing meeting,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One shortly after he departed Busan, adding that tariffs imposed on Chinese imports would be cut to 47 per cent from 57 per cent. Trading in global stocks was choppy as Trump revealed details of the deal, with major Asian indexes and European futures swinging between gains and losses. China’s Shanghai Composite Index slipped from a 10-year high, while US soybean futures were weaker. World stock markets from Wall Street to Tokyo had hit record highs leading up to the meeting on hopes of a breakthrough in a trade war between the world’s two largest economies that has upended supply chains and rocked global business confidence. The meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, lasted nearly two hours. Trump shook hands and escorted Xi to his car before the US president was given a red-carpet send-off at the airport. Trump repeatedly talked up the prospect of reaching agreement with Xi since US negotiators on Sunday said they had agreed a framework with China that will avoid 100 per cent US tariffs on Chinese goods and achieve a deferral of China’s export curbs on rare earths, a sector it dominates. But with both countries increasingly willing to play hardball over areas of economic and geopolitical competition, many questions remain about how long any trade detente may last. — Reuters",2025-10-30 05:22:52,Malay Mail,neutral,0.5946,1,Economic_Economies_Korea
Alausa’s skills-focused agenda gets support,"Education October 30, 2025 by Bola Olajuwon and Victoria Amadi The Minister of Education, Dr. Maruf Tunji Alausa, has embarked on a comprehensive overhaul of the country’s education system since he took over the ministry, moving from the traditional structure towards a skills-focused curriculum and a sustainable education model. A major part of the reforms is the restructuring of the national curriculum for basic, senior secondary and technical education, which commenced this academic year. The ministry had also added new vocational and trade subjects to the curriculum, including digital literacy, solar installation, agricultural entrepreneurship, and garment making. This is intended to entrench practical skills from an early age and prepare students for the demands of the modern job market. According to the minister, the total number of subjects a student would offer would be streamlined across different grade levels to reduce “content overload” and enable deeper learning. The government has converted federal science and technical colleges into modern technical colleges. This includes free tuition and stipends for students, with a curriculum that is 80 per cent practical and 20 per cent theoretical. Alausa has also emphasised the need for ongoing education reforms to move beyond policy declarations and deliver practical outcomes that strengthen skills, innovation, and job creation among young people. According to him, the ultimate goal of the reforms is to ensure that students are not only educated but also equipped with the competencies required to thrive in a fast-changing global economy. He explained that the Federal Government was working to align education with the needs of the labour market through curriculum review, improved teacher training, and investment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. READ ALSO: Why petrol prices are high despite cheaper crude The minister, at the National Education Group (NEG) Meeting in Abuja, noted that the future of the country depended on how well its education system produced citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. Alausa said: “Our reforms must go beyond the paperwork of policy; they must impact classrooms, teachers, and ultimately the learners. Education should not end with certificates but open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity.” According to him, the ministry is prioritising partnerships with the private sector and development agencies to expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research, and digital learning. “If we are to build a competitive economy, we must invest in the skills and knowledge base of our young people so that they can become drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added. The NEG Meeting brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including policymakers, education administrators, academics, and development partners, to deliberate on strategies for improving education delivery and learning outcomes across all levels. Participants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector. During the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population. He added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole. CONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities The President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction. Sunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform. However, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation. Reiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective. He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” A major part of the reforms is the restructuring of the national curriculum for basic, senior secondary and technical education, which commenced this academic year.

There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” The government has converted federal science and technical colleges into modern technical colleges. This includes free tuition and stipends for students, with a curriculum that is 80 per cent practical and 20 per cent theoretical. Alausa has also emphasised the need for ongoing education reforms to move beyond policy declarations and deliver practical outcomes that strengthen skills, innovation, and job creation among young people. According to him, the ultimate goal of the reforms is to ensure that students are not only educated but also equipped with the competencies required to thrive in a fast-changing global economy. He explained that the Federal Government was working to align education with the needs of the labour market through curriculum review, improved teacher training, and investment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. READ ALSO: Why petrol prices are high despite cheaper crude The minister, at the National Education Group (NEG) Meeting in Abuja, noted that the future of the country depended on how well its education system produced citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. Alausa said: “Our reforms must go beyond the paperwork of policy; they must impact classrooms, teachers, and ultimately the learners. Education should not end with certificates but open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity.” According to him, the ministry is prioritising partnerships with the private sector and development agencies to expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research, and digital learning. “If we are to build a competitive economy, we must invest in the skills and knowledge base of our young people so that they can become drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added. The NEG Meeting brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including policymakers, education administrators, academics, and development partners, to deliberate on strategies for improving education delivery and learning outcomes across all levels. Participants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector. During the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population. He added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole. CONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities The President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction. Sunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform. However, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation. Reiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective. He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more.

He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” Alausa said: “Our reforms must go beyond the paperwork of policy; they must impact classrooms, teachers, and ultimately the learners. Education should not end with certificates but open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity.” According to him, the ministry is prioritising partnerships with the private sector and development agencies to expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research, and digital learning. “If we are to build a competitive economy, we must invest in the skills and knowledge base of our young people so that they can become drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added. The NEG Meeting brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including policymakers, education administrators, academics, and development partners, to deliberate on strategies for improving education delivery and learning outcomes across all levels. Participants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector. During the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population. He added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole. CONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities The President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction. Sunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform. However, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation. Reiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective. He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue.

He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” During the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population. He added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole. CONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities The President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction. Sunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform. However, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation. Reiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective. He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction.

Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction.

He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity.

"The Grand Egyptian Museum showcasing 50,000 artifacts is finally opening","CAIRO: After two decades of anticipation and countless delays, the Grand Egyptian Museum is finally having its grand reveal. The museum, which is set to officially open Saturday, highlights Egypt’s ancient civilization and is a centerpiece of the government’s drive to boost the tourist industry, a major source of foreign currency in the cash-strapped country. Located just outside Cairo next to the famed Giza Pyramids, the $1 billion mammoth facility is poised to become the world’s largest museum dedicated to a single civilization with over 50,000 artifacts detailing the life in ancient Egypt. By comparison, the Louvre Museum in Paris has about 35,000 pieces on display. The museum is one of the mega-projects championed by President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, who since taking office in 2014 embarked on massive investments in infrastructure with the aim of reviving an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered by the unrest that followed the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. The museum’s construction began in 2005, but work stopped for three years during the political turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising. The grand opening was postponed multiple times, most recently in July this year because of conflicts in the Middle East. World leaders are expected to attend the opening ceremony Saturday. Giant building with a view of the Giza Pyramids Designed by the Irish firm Heneghan Peng Architects, the museum, known as GEM, boasts a towering, triangular glass façade imitating the nearby pyramids. In its entrance atrium stands the granite colossus of one of Egypt’s most famed pharaohs, Ramesses the Great. The 3,200-year-old, 11-meters-tall (36-foot-tall) statue was moved to the museum after decades of standing in the center of a traffic-clogged roundabout in front of Cairo’s main train station. From the atrium, a grand six-story staircase lined with ancient statues leads up to the main galleries and a view of the nearby pyramids. A bridge links the museum to the pyramids, allowing tourists to move between them either on foot or via electric, environment-friendly vehicles, according to museum officials. The museum includes 24,000 square meters (258,000 square feet) of permanent exhibition space, a children’s museum and conference and educational facilities, and a commercial area as well as a large conservation center. The 12 main galleries, which opened last year, exhibit antiquities spanning from prehistoric times to the Roman era, organized by era and by themes. Many of the 50,000 artifacts in the GEM were moved from the Egyptian Museum, a packed, century-old building in downtown Cairo’s Tahrir Square. Others were recently unearthed from ancient cemeteries, including the Saqqara necropolis, another complex of pyramids and tombs about 14 miles (22 kilometers) south of the museum. The halls are equipped with advanced technology and feature multimedia presentations including mixed-reality shows to help explain ancient Egypt to new generations, said Ahmed Ghoneim, the museum’s CEO. “We’re using the language that the Gen Z uses right now,” he said in an interview. “Gen Z doesn’t use anymore the labels that we read as old people but rather use technology.” Tutankhamun collection in one place for the first time Saturday’s grand opening will include the inauguration of two halls dedicated to the 5,000 artifacts from the collection of King Tutankhamun. The collection is being displayed in its entirety for the first time since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered King Tut’s tomb in 1922 in the southern city of Luxor. The old Egyptian Museum didn’t have enough space to show all the tomb’s treasures at once. Some masterpieces were restored at the museum’s conservation center, including the boy pharaoh’s three funeral beds and six chariots, said Jailan Mohamed, chief restorer at the conservation center. They will be displayed along with his golden throne, his gold-covered sarcophagus and his burial mask, made of gold, quartzite, lapis lazuli and colored glass. The mask’s beard was accidentally knocked off and hastily glued back on with epoxy in 2014, before a German-Egyptian team of experts fixed it the following year. Another centerpiece of the museum is the 4,600-year-old solar boat of King Khufu, the pharaoh who is credited with building the Great Pyramid of Giza. The 43-meter-long (140-foot) wooden boat, discovered in the 1950s, was buried next to the Great Pyramid for Khufu — or Cheops as he is also known — to use in the afterlife. In 2021, it was moved from its display site by the pyramids into the Grand Egyptian Museum on a remote-controlled vehicle imported from Belgium. The government hopes that the museum will revitalize tourism The government hopes the museum will draw more tourists who will stay for a while and provide the foreign currency Egypt needs to shore up its economy. The tourism sector suffered from years of political turmoil and violence following the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. In recent years, the sector has started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the effects of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine are a major source of tourists visiting Egypt. A record number of 15.7 million visited the country in 2024, according to official figures, and the government aims to attract 30 million visitors by 2032. Authorities overhauled the whole area around the museum and the pyramids. Roads were paved and a metro station is being constructed outside the museum gates to ease access to the sites. An airport, Sphinx International Airport, was also opened west of Cairo — 40 minutes from the museum. Hassan Allam, CEO of Hassan Allam Holding, the firm administering the museum, said they’re expecting between 15,000 and 20,000 visitors a day at the museum. “The world has been waiting … Everyone’s excited,” he said.",2025-10-30 05:21:41,Arab News Pk,positive,0.7895,0,Economy_Prosperity_Sector
Trump says tariffs on China are dropping from 57% to 47% after talks on fentanyl curbs with Xi Jinping,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump described his face-to-face with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday as a roaring success, saying he would cut tariffs on China, while Beijing had agreed to allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans. The president told reporters aboard Air Force One that the U.S. would lower tariffs implemented earlier this year as punishment on China for its selling of chemicals used to make fentanyl from 20% to 10%. That brings the total combined tariff rate on China down from 57% to 47% “I guess on the scale from 0 to 10, with ten being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,” Trump said. “I think it was a 12.” Trump said that he would go to China in April and Xi would come to the U.S. “some time after that.” The president said they also discussed the export of more advanced computer chips to China, saying that Nvidia would be in talks with Chinese officials. Trump said he could sign a trade deal with China “pretty soon.” Xi said Washington and Beijing would work to finalize their agreements to provide “peace of mind” to both countries and the rest of the world, according to a report on the meeting distributed by state media. “Both sides should take the long-term perspective into account, focusing on the benefits of cooperation rather than falling into a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation,” he said. Despite Trump’s optimism after a 100-minute meeting with Xi in South Korea, there continues to be the potential for major tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Both nations are seeking dominant places in manufacturing, developing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and shaping world affairs like Russia’s war in Ukraine. Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs since returning to the White House for a second term, combined with China’s retaliatory limits on exports of rare earth elements, gave the meeting newfound urgency. There is a mutual recognition that neither side wants to risk blowing up the world economy in ways that could jeopardize their own country’s fortunes. When the two were seated at the start of the meeting, Xi read prepared remarks that stressed a willingness to work together despite differences. “Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other,” he said through a translator. “It is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then.” There was a slight difference in translation as China’s Xinhua News Agency reported Xi as telling Trump that having some differences is inevitable. The leaders met in Busan, South Korea, a port city about 76 kilometers (47 miles) south from Gyeongju, the main venue for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. In the days leading up to the meeting, U.S. officials signaled that Trump did not intend to make good on a recent threat to impose an additional 100% import tax on Chinese goods, and China showed signs it was willing to relax its export controls on rare earths and also buy soybeans from America. Officials from both countries met earlier this week in Kuala Lumpur to lay the groundwork for their leaders. Afterward, China’s top trade negotiator Li Chenggang said they had reached a “preliminary consensus,” a statement affirmed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who said there was “ a very successful framework.” Shortly before the meeting on Thursday, Trump posted on Truth Social that the meeting would be the “G2,” a recognition of America and China’s status as the world’s biggest economies. The Group of Seven and Group of 20 are other forums of industrialized nations. But while those summits often happen at luxury spaces, this meeting took place in humbler surroundings: Trump and Xi met in a small gray building with a blue roof on a military base adjacent to Busan’s international airport. The anticipated detente has given investors and businesses caught between the two nations a sense of relief. The U.S. stock market has climbed on the hopes of a trade framework coming out of the meeting. Pressure points remain for both US and China Trump has outward confidence that the grounds for a deal are in place, but previous negotiations with China this year in Geneva, Switzerland and London had a start-stop quality to them. The initial promise of progress has repeatedly given way to both countries seeking a better position against the other. “The proposed deal on the table fits the pattern we’ve seen all year: short-term stabilization dressed up as strategic progress,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “Both sides are managing volatility, calibrating just enough cooperation to avert crisis while the deeper rivalry endures.” The U.S. and China have each shown they believe they have levers to pressure the other, and the past year has demonstrated that tentative steps forward can be short-lived. For Trump, that pressure comes from tariffs. China had faced new tariffs this year totaling 30%, of which 20% were tied to its role in fentanyl production. But the tariff rates have been volatile. In April, he announced plans to jack the rate on Chinese goods to 145%, only to abandon those plans as markets recoiled. Then, on Oct. 10, Trump threatened a 100% import tax because of China’s rare earth restrictions. That figure, including past tariffs, would now be 47% “effective immediately,” Trump told reporters on Thursday. Xi has his own chokehold on the world economy because China is the top producer and processor of the rare earth minerals needed to make fighter jets, robots, electric vehicles and other high-tech products. China had tightened export restrictions on Oct. 9, repeating a cycle in which each nation jockeys for an edge only to back down after more trade talks. What might also matter is what happens directly after their talks. Trump plans to return to Washington, while Xi plans to stay on in South Korea to meet with regional leaders during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which officially begins on Friday. “Xi sees an opportunity to position China as a reliable partner and bolster bilateral and multilateral relations with countries frustrated by the U.S. administration’s tariff policy,” said Jay Truesdale, a former State Department official who is CEO of TD International, a risk and intelligence advisory firm. ___ Ken Moritsugu in Beijing and Seung Min Kim and Michelle Price in Washington contributed to this report.

Florence Press Conference Confirms ECB Remains Comfortable in Its Good Place,"Even a change of scenery has done nothing to change the European Central Bank’s current wait-and-see stance. Florence, where the ECB met today for its only annual meeting outside of Frankfurt, is apparently also this ’good place’, the central bank’s well-known pseudonym for comfortably keeping interest rates on hold. ECB President Christine Lagarde even called it a ‘magnificent’ place – Florence, that is, not rates. The comments at the press conference confirmed once again that the ECB has no intention to leave its ‘good place’ any time soon. We had feared a rather uneventful press conference. What should we say? We hate to be right… Anyhow, here are a few interesting remarks made by Lagarde: On the ECB’s risk assessment, the introductory statement had the most remarkable change compared with September. Last month, the ECB had still talked about risks to the growth outlook that had become “more balanced”; today, it refrained from qualifying any balance of risk. Instead, the central bank had a somewhat more extensive list of upside and downside risks to the growth outlook. Lagarde even said that some of the downside risks had abated. When asked whether this was a sign of an upcoming shift in the balance of risk, the ECB’s President pointed out that it had already narrowed the risks at the September meeting. Funnily enough, back at the September meeting, there had been no mention of a narrowing of risks. Supply chain disruptions. Lagarde referred to a discussion on potential supply chain bottlenecks that could still arise as a result of the latest tensions between China and the EU on microchips and rare earths in general. Risks to inflation. As in the past, the ECB didn’t provide an assessment of the balance of risks to inflation. However, during the press conference, Lagarde mentioned different positions, views and analyses regarding inflation within the Governing Council. These differing views do exist, despite a unanimous decision to keep rates on hold today. A particular concern remains service inflation, which the ECB has often labelled as being too high. Looking ahead, today’s meeting has done nothing to change the view that the bar for yet another rate cut from the ECB is high. In fact, the Bank currently feels very comfortable in its ‘good place’. With the ECB’s own growth forecasts indicating that the eurozone economy will grow by slightly more than 1% each year and inflation will settle down to 2% over the next few years, there is indeed very little reason to change its monetary policy stance. At the same time, there are still valid dovish arguments that could force the central bank to cut again at the December meeting. Just think of the delayed adverse impact of US tariffs, the stronger euro exchange rate, French politics or a delay in Germany’s fiscal stimulus. If any of these downside risks materialise, we can expect the ECB to engage in one or two more rate cuts. On this point, it remains important to note that the current ECB inflation forecast for 2027 includes a 0.2ppt impact from the introduction of the ETS2 system. Needless to say, any delay in the implementation could have implications for the ECB as it would increase the risk of inflation undershooting. Even if Lagarde tried to downplay this issue during the press conference. In any case, even if the ECB seems to rest more comfortably on its laurels than before, the December staff projections will be crucial and could still invade its good place. If the 2028 inflation forecasts come in sub-1.7%, the likelihood of yet another rate cut would increase. More generally speaking, Lagarde didn’t give away any hints at what’s next for the ECB. Maybe the strongest message came from the colours of the President’s scarf, which – at least to us – resembled the French flag. For the rest, today’s meeting was another illustration that the ECB has no intention whatsoever of leaving its ‘good place’ any time soon. *** Disclaimer: This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user’s means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Glen Burnie Bancorp Announces Third Quarter 2025 Results,"Highlights for the Third Quarter of 2025: Year-to-date through September 30, 2025, net earnings were $66,000 compared to a net loss of $72,000 during the same nine-month period in 2024. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2025 was $0.02, compared to a diluted loss per share of $(0.02) during the same period in 2024. ""We are pleased with our results for this quarter as our strategic initiatives that were started over a year ago, continue to improve our balance sheet position and earnings. We are also excited to complete the acquisition of VAWM as we believe that our new subsidiary will help grow our non-interest income, increase our ability to serve new markets, and add a cornerstone product to our expanding line of products and services,” said Mark C. Hanna, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our strategic priorities continue to focus on increasing new revenue sources by growing our client relationships and becoming more operationally efficient. Achieving these objectives will expand our return on assets and capital.” Mr. Hanna added, ""We were also very pleased to see that our deposit base and cost of funding continues to remain competitive and stable while seeing good growth in our loan revenues. With strong liquidity and ample capital, we are very excited about our future and the benefits our strategic initiatives are beginning to produce.” Loan Portfolio Quality/Allowance for Loan Losses The Bank’s asset quality metrics continue to be very good due to our focus on disciplined lending practices. The non-performing loans ratio as of September 30, 2025, was 0.56%, up 40 basis points from the third quarter 2024 and up slightly by 5 basis points from June 30, 2025. During the third quarter of 2025, the Bank had net charge-offs of $93,000 or 0.17% to average loans, as compared to net recoveries of $44,000 or -0.09% in the third quarter 2024, and net charge-offs of $45,000 or 0.09% in the second quarter of 2025. Provision expense was $44,000 in the third quarter 2025 compared to $105,000 for the third quarter 2024, and $79,000 in the second quarter 2025. The Bank’s allowance for loan losses to loans was 1.19% for the third quarter 2025, a decline of 0.02% from the second quarter of 2025 and a decline of 0.14% from the third quarter of 2024. Mr. Hanna noted, ""We continue to see and experience very good credit results and indicators in our markets, while our non-performing assets remain at lower levels. Our allowance for credit losses at 1.19% of loans, highlights our conservative stance on maintaining a healthy reserve on our balance sheet.” Balance Sheet Total loans were $215.3 million at September 30, 2025, an increase of $8.3 million, or 4.0%, from the third quarter of 2024, and $2.0 million from the second quarter of 2025. During the third quarter 2025, total average loans increased $7.3 million from the second quarter 2025 as a result of growth in commercial real estate loans of $2.4 million, $3.8 million of growth in the C&I portfolio, and a $1.1 million increase in consumer loans (automobile). Total deposits were $329.1 million at September 30, 2025, an increase of $14.8 million, or 4.7%, from the third quarter of 2024, and $11.8 million from the second quarter of 2025. Non-interest-bearing deposits, which are 33% of total deposits, were down by $8.6 million, or 7.4%, from the third quarter of 2024, and were relatively unchanged from the second quarter of 2025. Interest-bearing deposits ended at $221.7 million for the third quarter of 2025, a $23.4 million increase from the third quarter 2024, or 11.8%, and an increase of $11.4 million from the second quarter 2025. The Bank’s communities and markets remain very competitive for deposits by customers who are very rate sensitive. Interest-bearing cost of deposits increased on a linked quarter basis to 1.91% in the third quarter of 2025 from 1.78% due to the shift of deposit balances from lower cost deposits to the Bank’s higher rate money market accounts and CDs. Total cost of funds, including noninterest sources decreased 0.04% on a linked quarter basis to 1.32%. During the quarter the bank paid off all advances from the FHLB, which were $30 million at the end of the third quarter 2024 and $13.0 million at the end of the second quarter of 2025. Mr. Hanna commented, ""We are glad to see continued growth in our deposit base as those deposits are a strength of our Bank and a big contributor to our strong liquidity. As of September 30, 2025, our liquidity sources improved to the point where we paid off all FHLB advances by the end of the quarter. We still have many sources for additional liquidity in the form of $50.9 million in borrowing capacity with the FHLB, open pledging capacity of our securities portfolio of $56.8 million, $34.6 million in borrowing capacity with FRB, and additional access to other wholesale funding of $123 million. This additional liquidity capacity will provide the funding we need to create a more customer-based balance sheet as our reliance on investment securities continues to decline while growing commercial loan relationships within our markets and the communities we serve.” The investment securities available for sale was $104.1 million, after the fair value adjustment of $22.3 million at September 30, 2025, with a yield of 2.23% for the third quarter 2025, down $15.8 million from the third quarter of 2024, and down $0.4 million from the second quarter of 2025. The effective duration of the securities portfolio is 7.3 years. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) of $16.2 million was up from $15.7 million when compared to the third quarter of 2024, and down from the second quarter of 2025 by $1.7 million. Changes in the Bank’s AOCL in the investment portfolio are attributable to changes in the economy as bonds with longer maturities are more sensitive to interest rate changes. The Bank does not intend to sell nor buy any new securities as our strategic direction is to grow our balance sheet through new loans instead of increasing our reliance on the securities portfolio. Each of the regulatory capital ratios for the Bank exceeds the well capitalized minimum levels currently required by regulatory statute. At September 30, 2025, the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios (Leverage, Tier I Risk Based and Total Risk Based) were 9.67%, 14.82 %, and 15.96% respectively. These compared to the ratios as of June 30, 2025, of 9.59%, 14.91%, and 16.06% and to September 30, 2024, of 10.11%, 15.47%, and 16.72%, respectively. Revenue Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin Net interest income was $2.8 million for both the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, compared to net interest income of $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2025. The net interest margin for the third quarter of 2025, on a tax equivalent basis, was 3.24% up 10 basis points from the third quarter of 2024 and up 11 basis points from the second quarter of 2025. The increase in the Bank’s net interest margin is due a continued change in the mix of earning assets from lower yielding assets to higher yielding loans. Yields on total loans improved by 15 basis points to 5.73% on a linked quarter basis and were up 4 basis points from the third quarter of 2024, while the total cost of funds was 1.32% in both the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, but down 4 basis points over the second quarter of 2025 from 1.36%. Total earning assets were $354.9 million, down $11.3 million from the third quarter 2024 and down $4.4 million from the second quarter 2025. Mr. Hanna commented, ""We continue to see our mix of earning assets move from cash and securities to a higher percentage of loans. A year ago, in the third quarter of 2024, our loans were 56% of our earning assets where today at the end of the third quarter of 2025, loans represented 61% of our total earning assets, up from 58% in the second quarter of 2025. This is an important and intentional shift in our balance sheet to work around the existing securities portfolio structure.” Non-Interest Income Non-interest income in the third quarter of 2025 was $571,000 compared to $354,000 in the third quarter of 2024 and $220,000 in the second quarter of 2025. Mortgage fees from VAWM for the third quarter of 2025 were $192,000, which was the primary cause of the increased non-interest income. The Bank anticipates continued increases in its non-interest income in the form of mortgage fees due to the acquisition of VAWM. Non-Interest Expense Noninterest expense totaled $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, up $0.3 million from the third quarter of 2024, and relatively equal to the second quarter of 2025. Most of the increase from the third quarter of 2024 was related to non-recurring legal and professional fees from the acquisition of VAWM as well as new operating expenses from VAWM. Salary and related employment benefits were up $211,000 from the third quarter 2024 primarily due to increased headcount at the bank in the latter part of 2024 and new salaries and benefit costs at VAWM. When compared to the second quarter 2025, these costs were down by $161,000 as reductions in headcount in the first and second quarters of 2025 are now being recognized. Salaries and related benefits at VAWM for the third quarter of 2025 were $139,000. Occupancy and equipment expenses, legal, accounting and professional fees, and data processing services combined were up by $89,000 from the third quarter 2024 and up $188,000 from the second quarter 2025 primarily due to increases in legal and professional fees related to the VAWM acquisition and interim finance and accounting consulting help. All other expenses were relatively flat when compared to the third quarter 2024 and second quarter 2025. Acquisition Summary - VA Wholesale Mortgage Incorporated As of the close of business on August 15, 2025, the Bank, a Maryland-chartered bank, completed the acquisition of VAWM, a Virginia corporation engaged in residential mortgage banking, lending, and brokerage services, from Eric Tan, its sole shareholder (""Seller”). Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Bank purchased 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of VAWM for a total purchase price of $750,000, payable under a 36-month, interest-free promissory note. The note provides for monthly forgiveness of one-thirty-sixth of the balance over the term, subject to continuing employment and other specified conditions. Amortization of the note will be treated as compensation expense. In addition, the Seller is entitled to post-closing contingent consideration (""earn-out”) equal to 33% of VAWM’s net earnings plus 0.04% of closed-loan volume for a period of three years following the closing date, estimated to be $298,000 based on historical production and future growth. Earn-out payments are to be determined annually based on VAWM’s financial results, with supporting statements delivered after each year-end. Concurrent with closing, the Seller entered into an employment agreement with the Bank, continuing to serve in a management role to support the integration of the mortgage operations into the Bank’s business. The acquisition was affected through a private stock purchase and did not involve the issuance of any shares by the Bank. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase of a business under ASC 805, with VAWM becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank. The acquisition expands the Bank’s retail mortgage banking capabilities within its existing Mid-Atlantic market footprint. Further details of the financial impacts will be included in the Bancorp’s Financial Statements and Notes in Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2025.

Greece and Canada Explore Year-Round Direct Flight Service from Athens to Boost their Tourism and Business Ties,"Published on November 1, 2025 With the view to upgrading the Greek-Canadian bilateral relations, Greek Minister of Infrastructure and Transport Christos Dimas met with Canadian Transport Minister Steven MacKinnon to discuss a year-round, direct flight between Athens and Canada. The talks came during the Delphi Economic Forum Toronto Edition, where both countries discussed ways to deepen cooperation on aviation, logistics, digital infrastructure, and sustainable mobility. This new airlift will add even more force to tourism exchange between the two nations, which will also create new opportunities for business exchange and economic development.A Strategic Move to Enhance Tourism and ConnectivityThe proposal for a direct Athens–Canada flight comes at a time when both Greece and Canada are working to expand their tourism offerings and economic ties. As tourism demand continues to rise in both countries, establishing a direct air link would significantly reduce travel time and costs, benefiting both tourists and business professionals. With Canada’s large Greek diaspora and Greece’s rich cultural and natural offerings, the new service would not only attract more tourists but also strengthen cultural exchanges and mutual understanding between the two nations.Advertisement Minister Dimas emphasized that the proposed route would help position Greece as a gateway to Europe for Canadian travelers, facilitating access to not only Athens but also Greek islands like Santorini, Mykonos, and Crete. At the same time, it would provide Canadians with a convenient link to explore the rich cultural and natural attractions of Greece. By improving connectivity, Greece and Canada can work together to bolster the tourism sector, creating sustainable growth and offering unique travel experiences for visitors from both countries.Strengthening Economic and Trade RelationsWhile tourism is a key focus of this initiative, the direct Athens–Canada route will also have a substantial economic impact, particularly in trade relations. The proposed flight will help facilitate business exchanges and trade opportunities between Greece and Canada, particularly in industries such as shipping, agriculture, renewable energy, and technology.Advertisement By improving air connectivity, both countries will benefit from easier travel for business professionals, enabling smoother cross-border collaborations and improving the movement of goods and services. For example, Greek exporters will have enhanced access to the Canadian market, while Canadian businesses will find it easier to connect with partners in Greece and Southern Europe. This increased connectivity could also lead to new investment opportunities and a deeper integration of Greek and Canadian economies.A Focus on Sustainable Aviation and Eco-Friendly TravelBoth ministers highlighted the importance of sustainable mobility as part of this potential air service. The new flight will feature the latest in eco-friendly aviation technology, focusing on reducing carbon emissions and improving fuel efficiency. Greece’s tourism sector has increasingly prioritized sustainable travel in recent years, and the launch of the Athens–Canada route will align with these efforts by providing a green travel option for visitors.Advertisement The airline operating the route is expected to use fuel-efficient aircraft, such as the Airbus A320neo or A321neo, which are designed to significantly reduce CO2 emissions compared to older models. The focus on sustainability extends to the tourism experience as well, with eco-friendly accommodations and activities in Greece being promoted as part of the country’s push to become a leader in sustainable tourism. This aligns with Canada’s commitment to reducing its environmental footprint, particularly in the aviation and travel industries.Cultural and Educational Exchange OpportunitiesThe Athens–Canada direct route will not only foster tourism and business exchanges, but will also open doors for cultural and educational opportunities. Greek students and academics will benefit from easier access to Canadian universities and institutions, while Canadian travelers will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in Greek culture, history, and art. The two countries have long shared cultural ties, and a direct flight will only deepen these connections, allowing for greater collaboration in the arts, education, and heritage preservation.Cultural and heritage tourism in Greece is flourishing, and the new service would provide Canadians with better access to Greek heritage sites, including the Acropolis, Delphi, and Olympia, as well as the UNESCO World Heritage Sites found across the Greek islands.Supporting Sustainable Tourism Growth in GreeceGreece’s tourism sector continues to grow, with the country consistently attracting millions of visitors every year. However, the government is increasingly focusing on sustainable growth and destination management, ensuring that tourism development is environmentally responsible and socially beneficial for local communities. The Athens–Canada direct flight would play a vital role in supporting these goals, as it would promote regional tourism beyond the popular islands and larger cities, encouraging travelers to visit rural areas, archaeological sites, and small towns.Furthermore, the direct air connection could help reduce the pressure on overcrowded tourist destinations, by providing access to lesser-known regions and spreading tourism activity more evenly throughout the country. This sustainable tourism model aligns with the broader vision of creating long-term economic benefits for local communities, while also ensuring the preservation of Greece’s natural beauty and cultural heritage.Future Outlook: Expanding Greece-Canada Tourism and Trade RelationsIn the future, the Athens–Canada route is expected to act as a springboard to further growth in tourism and economic cooperation between Greece and Canada. The government and tourism authorities will continue to work closely with the airlines, travel agencies, and business partners to ensure that the route is successful and expands the connections to other key Canadian cities.The potential success of the Athens–Canada route will, in turn, encourage more regional air connectivity initiatives within the European and North American tourism markets. The ongoing cooperation between Greece and Canada sends the signal of commitment toward strengthening ties and building a future of sustainable and mutually beneficial tourism and economic exchanges.Advertisement Share On:Tags: Athens Canada direct flights for tourism, Greece Canada direct route for business and tourism growth, Greece Canada tourism and business ties, sustainable air travel Greece Canada 2025, year-round direct flight Athens CanadaSubscribe to our NewslettersFollow Travel And Tour World in Google News The proposal for a direct Athens–Canada flight comes at a time when both Greece and Canada are working to expand their tourism offerings and economic ties.

Punjab govt readies law to take on land-property mafia,"Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has approved Punjab Protection of Ownership and Immovable Property Ordinance 2025 to deal with those who grab the property of the people.

Maryam Nawaz said no one will snatch anyone’s land in Punjab now, a mother-like state stands with every weak.

OpenAI Launches Paid Tier for Sora AI Video Generations,"In a move that signals the maturation of artificial intelligence tools from experimental novelties to revenue-generating platforms, OpenAI has introduced a paid tier for its Sora video generation app, allowing users to purchase additional credits beyond daily free limits. This development, announced recently, marks a pivotal shift for the company as it seeks to balance accessibility with financial sustainability in the competitive AI space. According to reports, users can now buy bundles of 10 extra video generations for $4, a nominal fee that extends the app’s utility for heavy users who exhaust their complimentary allocations. The Sora app, which debuted on iOS with capabilities to create stunning AI-generated videos from text prompts, initially offered unlimited free generations to foster adoption and feedback. However, as user numbers swell, OpenAI is recalibrating its model to manage computational costs and prevent abuse. Bill Peebles, Sora’s chief, explained in interviews that this pay-for-more approach is the first step in a broader monetization strategy, with plans to reduce free daily limits in the coming months. Monetization Strategies Taking Shape Industry observers note that this pricing structure aligns with OpenAI’s evolving business model, reminiscent of how it transitioned ChatGPT from free access to subscription-based Plus and Enterprise tiers. The Verge detailed how the company is positioning Sora not just as a creative tool but as a potential economic ecosystem, including future licensing for copyrighted characters and cameo features. This could open revenue streams from partnerships with content creators and media firms, potentially transforming Sora into a marketplace for AI-enhanced video production. Moreover, the introduction of paid credits addresses the high operational expenses associated with AI video generation, which demands significant GPU resources. Sources indicate that while the current free tier allows around 30 generations per day, reductions are imminent to encourage upgrades, a tactic echoed in gaming and software industries where freemium models drive premium conversions. Implications for Users and Creators For creative professionals, this change could democratize access to advanced tools while introducing barriers for casual users. Filmmakers and marketers, who rely on iterative generation for projects, may welcome the option to scale up without waiting for resets, but concerns about equity arise. Mashable highlighted user reactions, with some praising the affordability of the $4 bundle, while others worry it foreshadows steeper paywalls that could stifle innovation in underserved communities. OpenAI’s executives have emphasized that this is part of building a “new Sora economy,” including monetized features like reusable avatars and video stitching. As Business Insider reported, the company envisions users earning from their creations, perhaps through integrated marketplaces, blending AI generation with blockchain-like royalty systems. The Broader AI Industry Shift This pivot reflects broader trends in the AI sector, where companies like Google and Meta are also exploring hybrid free-paid models to recoup investments in training massive models. Analysts suggest OpenAI’s strategy could set precedents for how generative AI tools evolve from hype to profitable ventures, especially amid regulatory scrutiny over energy consumption and intellectual property. Critics, however, point to potential downsides, such as increased digital divides. Mint noted that while the iOS-exclusive rollout limits accessibility, expansions to other platforms are planned, potentially broadening reach. As OpenAI navigates these waters, the success of Sora’s paid features will likely influence investor confidence and competitive responses. Future Horizons and Challenges Looking ahead, OpenAI plans to integrate more advanced capabilities, such as higher-resolution outputs and collaborative editing, which could justify premium pricing. Yet, challenges remain, including competition from open-source alternatives and ethical concerns over deepfakes. Engadget reported on the company’s intent to introduce licensing options, allowing brands to protect and profit from their IP within Sora’s ecosystem. Ultimately, this monetization layer underscores OpenAI’s ambition to lead in AI video, turning creative potential into a sustainable business. As the platform matures, it may redefine content creation, blending human ingenuity with machine efficiency in ways that benefit both innovators and the bottom line.",2025-10-31 20:16:16,Webpronews,positive,0.5999,2,Demand_Spending_Industry

Highlighting the economic and social value of the new road network, the governor said it would ease transportation difficulties, promote commerce, and enhance connectivity within Sokoto and neighbouring areas. “No economic or social program can succeed without functional infrastructure,” Aliyu noted. “By investing in this road, we are not only easing movement today but securing the economic prosperity of Mabera for tomorrow.” While reaffirming his administration’s commitment to continuous infrastructural renewal across the state, the governor pledged to keep channelling resources into projects that directly improve living standards and open up opportunities for the people. He expressed appreciation to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his leadership and ongoing reforms in the economy and security sectors, assuring that Sokoto would continue to align with the President’s development agenda. “With this commissioning, we are not just opening a road; we are opening a pathway to a brighter future,” he said. In his remarks, Abdulaziz Abubakar Yari, former Zamfara State Governor, praised Governor Ahmed Aliyu for embarking on people-oriented projects, noting that the people of Sokoto State are proud of his leadership. The governor then inaugurated the Mabera Road Network for public use, marking a significant milestone in the state’s infrastructural development. In a symbolic gesture, the governor renamed Katin Sanni Road within the Mabera community after Senator Abdulaziz Yari, the special guest of honor at the event, who is a former Zamfara Governor.",2025-10-31 21:16:53,New Telegraph,positive,0.7706,0,Economy_Prosperity_Sector

"Impound, Don’t Go Nuclear","Eliminating the Senate filibuster would be a boon for the Democrats. President Trump, after completing his highly successful trade and diplomacy trip to the Indo-Pacific region, where he outfoxed and cornered Communist China in so many areas, then wrote a long Truth Social note where he advocated for ending the government shutdown with what is called the “nuclear option.” He wrote: “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW.” I can surely understand Mr. Trump’s frustration with the radical Democratic Party that is being driven by the Mamdani-AOC-Bernie Sanders socialist wing. Yet I do not think ending the filibuster is a good idea. Speaking as someone who strongly supports the president’s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation, energy dominance, reciprocal free trade, closing the border and so forth, I think ending the filibuster would do great damage to those pro-growth policies, which miraculously passed under “one big, beautiful” bill. Mr. Trump himself admits in his Truth Social post that the Democrats fought hard to end the filibuster, but failed. He even notes that ending the filibuster would at some point allow Democrats to pack the Supreme Court, make Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico new states, thereby picking up four senate seats and many House seats and electoral votes from those ultra-liberal places. The Committee to Unleash Prosperity adds to the list it would’ve passed without the filibuster: A national voter ID ban, the Green New Deal, card check for union elections, a $15 minimum wage, a cap-and-trade national energy tax, completely socialized medicine, and the PRO Act’s forced unionization. Let’s not go there. I have a much better idea: presidential impoundment. Mr. Trump’s budget director, Russell Vought, is ready to pull the trigger on non-essential federal employees who will remain non-essential, forever. I call it DOGE 2.0. In short, keep the non-essential non-essential; that’s existential. And all those pork-barrel Democratic spending items that President Biden lined up for his re-election last year, that stuff was so bad it even gives waste, fraud, and abuse a bad name. I’ll be polite: they’re all non-essential. Because the government is presently unfunded, the chief executive has the authority to impound personnel and non-entitlement programs. While Mr. Vought has his weapon locked and loaded, he’s being held back by a lower court judge who has enjoined the administration from taking these actions. Yet all that is on appeal and is likely to be overturned. Unquestionably, Mr. Trump as the chief of the executive branch has the inherent constitutional power to impound during this period. If Democrats come back to power without a filibuster rule to restrain them, they will spend, tax, and regulate a quadrillion dollars worth of programs that will destroy the economy. On the other hand, if Mr. Trump exercises his executive authority to impound non-essentials, he will greatly slim down the size and scope of the federal government, while reducing deficits and debt along the way. In that scenario, economic prosperity will flourish almost more than anybody can possibly imagine.

"PA premier says Ramallah best placed to lead postwar Gaza, despite Israeli obstacles","Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa made the case on Thursday for Ramallah to play a leading role in the postwar management of Gaza, arguing that it is best positioned to do so despite the obstacles put up by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. “The Palestinian Authority is important, not only for keep[ing] the West Bank stable, but also for restoring the situation in Gaza,” Mustafa said during a virtual event with the Washington-based Brookings Institution think tank. “Despite all the challenges, despite all the difficulties, despite the issues that need reform — which we are working on — the only party that can get things back on track with support from international partners is the Palestinian Authority.” While much of the international community backs the PA replacing Hamas as the governing body in Gaza, Israel has maintained an effective veto over the transition, claiming that the Ramallah-based body is irredeemably corrupt and encourages violence against Israel. US President Donald Trump’s administration has sometimes been similarly critical of the PA, and even barred PA President Mahmoud Abbas from entering the US for the UN General Assembly last month. But as key Arab stakeholders have conditioned their support in the post-war management of Gaza on a role for a reformed PA, Washington appears to be slightly adapting its approach, allowing Abbas to participate in a conference of world leaders earlier this month in Egypt, where Trump was seen warmly embracing the PA leader. A longtime economic adviser to Abbas who previously served as deputy prime minister and economy minister, in addition to heading the Palestine Investment Fund and holding senior positions at the World Bank, Mustafa was appointed prime minister last year amid mounting calls for reform of the PA, which hasn’t held parliamentary elections since 2006 and presidential elections since 2005. He used the relatively rare appearance before an American audience to lay out the challenges the PA faces and the reforms that he has been implementing. Mustafa began by highlighting the over 1,000 checkpoints that the IDF has sprung up throughout the West Bank that have significantly curbed Palestinian movement, hampering the West Bank economy as a result. Israel says the measures are needed to maintain the security of settlers living in the territory amid efforts by Palestinian terror groups to target civilians and soldiers. The PA premier went on to highlight the over $3 billion in funds that the Israeli government has been withholding from the PA, which “has been making our economic life extremely difficult.” Due to the PA’s sub-state status, the Oslo Accords stipulate that Israel collect clearance revenues on the authority’s behalf and transfer those funds on a monthly basis to Ramallah. The PA is heavily reliant on the funds, which make up a majority of its annual budget. Israel has repeatedly withheld such funds, citing the PA’s welfare payments to convicted terrorists and their families, as well as the relatives of dead attackers, with Jerusalem saying the practice directly rewards terror. Abbas signed a decree in February ending the policy of payments to prisoners based on the length of their sentence. While documents obtained by The Times of Israel indicate that the old system has indeed been scrapped, Israel claims it remains in place, but has yet to offer proof on the matter. The lack of funds has meant public sector employees have missed out on 13 months of salary payments over the last three years alone, Mustafa said. Public school teachers have gone on strike due to partially paid salaries, thus causing a delay to the start of the school year. Meanwhile, new Israeli banking policies have also prevented the PA from depositing roughly $4.6 billion, creating a severe liquidity crisis that has compounded the already-dire economic situation. Unemployment in the West Bank has climbed to 35 percent, with more than 200,000 Palestinians losing their jobs inside Israel when the IDF revoked their entry permits due to security concerns following the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023. Mustafa said that Ramallah has managed to convince Arab and European countries to provide additional assistance to offset the lack of funds, but the PA is still piling up a massive deficit due to borrowing from the private sector. The PA premier then highlighted the IDF’s counter-terror operations throughout the West Bank that have forced tens of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in the midst of the economic crisis. Israel says such operations are a security necessity to combat entrenched terror networks and prevent numerous plots for deadly attacks every year. Those raids have taken place amid near-daily attacks by settlers on Palestinians that have gone largely unchecked. The Biden administration led Western countries in sanctioning extremist settler individuals and entities last year. But Trump had undone the policy, and Mustafa acknowledged that the sanctions had little effect on the ground. Nonetheless, he urged countries to take “more serious actions to give the right signal… to this Israeli government that this is not acceptable.” Asked about the reforms that he and the PA are undertaking, Mustafa acknowledged that Ramallah still has work to do, but he pointed to elections that Abbas has agreed to hold next year. Municipal elections will also be held in early 2026, the prime minister said. Abbas has announced plans for elections on multiple occasions in the past, but has repeatedly canceled them. He has blamed Israeli restrictions, but critics have pointed to fears that he and his widely unpopular Fatah party would suffer crushing defeats in any public vote. “Even if we are not the best performing administration in the world, we still have a responsibility toward our people, especially our people in Gaza,” Mustafa said. “What they need most today is assistance so that we can shelter them, send their kids back to schools, treat the injured people, start getting them new jobs… [and] rebuild Gaza.” He also noted that while many world leaders have called on the PA to reform, the term has become something of a buzzword that often goes unspecified. “While we are making every effort to [carry out] these reforms, we hope that this will not be used as an excuse for the Israeli government to continue its occupation,” Mustafa said. As for the PA’s ability to resume running Gaza after it was ousted by Hamas in 2007, Mustafa pointed out that Ramallah already has 35,000 employees in the Strip, including 6,000 teachers, 7,000 doctors and thousands of dormant security personnel, which could serve as the backbone for a police force necessary for stabilizing Gaza. Several thousand other PA employees are also being trained by Jordan and Egypt in order to be later deployed in Gaza, he said, adding that PA personnel have also been tasked with helping resume the management of the Rafah Border Crossing, once Israel agrees to reopen it. Mustafa said the PA is prepared to formally invite an international security force to help stabilize the Strip, as envisioned by Trump’s 20-point plan for ending the war. However, he stressed that the security force be mandated by the UN Security Council, work with and support existing PA forces, and also be a temporary solution. “I encourage everybody to help get the PA in the right place… not only to govern in the West Bank, but also in Gaza because this is the best way possible to get us out of the situation in [the Strip],” Mustafa continued. “No international mission alone can do it. The PA is a big asset for stability in the region.” Asked in closing how he views the recent decisions by several major Western countries to recognize a Palestinian state, Mustafa insisted that those moves were not merely symbolic. “I think this will help us restore hope that a two-state solution is still possible [by demonstrating that] there is still a strong international support for it,” he said. “It’s important to remind the Israeli government and the Israeli people that occupation is not the solution. There are still millions of Palestinians living next door, and they still demand their rights, regardless of time passing.” Support The Times of Israel's independent journalism and receive access to our documentary series, DocuNation: The Heart of Israel.

Wall Street gains on Amazon boost but rate caution tempers enthusiasm,"Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox Traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, in New York City, on Oct 30. PHOTO: AFP Summary AI generated Published Nov 01, 2025, 05:13 AM Updated Nov 01, 2025, 05:13 AM NEW YORK - Wall Street’s main stock indexes closed higher on Oct 31, with their biggest boost coming from Amazon’s upbeat earnings forecast, but sentiment was dampened by worries that the Federal Reserve is becoming more cautious about cutting rates. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow boasted weekly gains and their longest monthly winning streaks in years. Amazon shares rallied sharply, closing up 9.6 per cent after hitting an all-time high following its forecast for quarterly sales above estimates. The online retailer and cloud services giant helped the consumer discretionary sector close up 4 per cent for its biggest one-day gain since May 12. But elsewhere in megacap companies, Apple’s shares closed down 0.4 per cent after its forecast for iPhone holiday quarter sales surpassed Wall Street expectations was clouded by chief executive officer Tim Cook’s flagging of supply constraints. And in remarks that cooled investor hopes for policy easing, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president Raphael Bostic said on Oct 31 that a December rate cut was not locked in despite market expectations for a cut. And Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Beth Hammack said she had opposed a rate cut on Oct 29 because inflation is too high. On Oct 31, traders were pricing in a 65 per cent probability of a December rate cut, down from 72.8 per cent on Oct 30 and 91.7 per cent a week ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. “The theme today is pretty similar to what we saw yesterday. It’s earnings coming in a little better than expected but tempered by a little more hawkish commentary from the Fed,” said Mr James Ragan, co-CIO and director of investment management research at D.A. Davidson. Mr Jake Seltz, portfolio manager for the Empiric LT Equity team at Allspring, said investors “may have gotten in front of their skis” in their bets for lower rates. Some grocery stocks traded lower on Oct 31 on worries about a dip in November sales if federal food aid benefits, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or Snap, lapse in the ongoing government shutdown. Two federal judges ruled on Oct 31 that President Donald Trump’s administration cannot suspend food aid for millions of Americans during the shutdown, saying the government must use contingency funds to pay for the benefits. But shares of grocer Kroger ended down 2.8 per cent while food supplier Conagra Brands lost 1.3 per cent and Walmart ended down 1 per cent even after the rulings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 40.75 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 47,562.87, the S&P 500 gained 17.86 points, or 0.26 per cent, to 6,840.20 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 143.81 points, or 0.61 per cent, to 23,724.96. For the month, the S&P 500 added 2.27 per cent, for a sixth consecutive monthly gain, which was its longest such streak since August 2021. The Nasdaq Composite added 4.7 per cent for October, capping a seven-month winning streak, its longest since early 2018. The Dow rose 2.5 per cent for the month, for its sixth straight monthly gain and its longest monthly advance since January 2018. For the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent while the Nasdaq added 2.24 per cent and the Dow climbed 0.75 per cent. Of the 315 S&P 500 companies that have reported third-quarter results so far, 83.2 per cent have surpassed analysts’ estimates, according to LSEG data. That is well above the historical average, where roughly 67 per cent of firms beat forecasts. With a lack of economic data from the government due to the month-long shutdown, Ms Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital, said investors were keenly focused on earnings reports. “The government isn’t giving us the data that we have become dependent on, so we’re using companies as we should by the way for guidance about how the economy is going,” she said. In other moves, Warner Bros Discovery jumped 8.7 per cent following a Reuters report that Netflix was actively exploring a bid for the company’s studio and streaming business. Netflix rose 2.7 per cent after it unveiled plans for a 10-for-1 stock split. Western Digital closed up 8.7 per cent after rallying to an all-time high following its forecast of quarterly earnings above Wall Street estimates. Shares of Solar panel maker First Solar surged 14.3 per cent after surpassing expectations for third-quarter sales. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.28-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, where there were 159 new highs and 131 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 2,773 stocks rose and 1,958 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.42-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 34 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 159 new lows. On US exchanges, 21.03 billion shares changed hands compared with the 21.13 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

West Africa Takes Digital Leap With SIGMAT Customs Launch,"The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is officially launching a homegrown digital customs platform that could fundamentally transform how goods move across the region’s borders, as technical experts from Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Liberia convene in Monrovia this week to finalize preparations for rolling out the Interconnected System for the Management of Goods in Transit. The two day meeting, taking place October 30 through 31 in the Liberian capital, brings together senior customs officials and ICT specialists to review operational guidelines and technical protocols before Friday’s official launch ceremony. SIGMAT, as the platform is known, represents years of planning to create a real time digital network enabling customs authorities across ECOWAS member states to exchange transit data electronically, track cargo movements, and process clearances with minimal paperwork. The system is designed to make cross border trade faster, safer, and more transparent, with officials saying the platform will help tackle smuggling and documentation fraud while ensuring more efficient coordination among customs agencies along regional trade corridors. For a region where trucks can sit at borders for days awaiting clearance while goods spoil and costs mount, the potential impact looks substantial. What makes SIGMAT particularly significant is its homegrown nature. Rather than importing expensive foreign solutions that might not fit West African realities, ECOWAS developed this platform specifically for the region’s needs and challenges. As of May 2025, nine ECOWAS member states had already installed SIGMAT in their customs IT systems, with only Guinea Bissau and Cabo Verde yet to implement, demonstrating momentum building toward broader regional adoption. The initial rollout among Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Liberia creates a strategic corridor linking coastal and landlocked nations, addressing one of West Africa’s most persistent trade challenges. Landlocked countries like Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger depend entirely on coastal neighbors for access to international markets, making efficient transit systems crucial for their economic survival. When transit goods get stuck at borders or disappear through diversion, these landlocked nations suffer disproportionately. Friday’s launch ceremony will be attended by the Heads of Customs Administrations from the three participating countries, representatives of the ECOWAS Commission, and key development partners including the German International Cooperation Agency, which has supported SIGMAT’s development. This multi stakeholder approach reflects recognition that transforming regional trade requires coordination across governments, technical agencies, and international supporters. The platform operates as a centralized digital hub connecting customs administrations across member states. Importers, exporters, and customs agents submit declarations electronically through the SIGMAT portal, which then standardizes documentation across ECOWAS countries, reducing discrepancies and ensuring compliance with regional trade agreements. The system allows customs officials in different countries to access shared data instantly, eliminating redundant paperwork that has historically slowed border crossings. For goods in transit, SIGMAT provides end to end visibility by issuing electronic transit documents tracked in real time as cargo moves across borders. This ensures duties and taxes are properly managed while reducing risks of smuggling and revenue leakage that have plagued West African trade corridors for decades. A shipment moving from Abidjan to Monrovia, for instance, would be monitored digitally with automated alerts for any deviations from approved routes. The system’s benefits extend beyond just faster processing. By reducing clearance times by up to 40% and minimizing physical inspections, SIGMAT can lower costs for businesses through reduced demurrage and storage charges that have long plagued ports due to delays. For traders operating on thin margins, these savings could mean the difference between profit and loss on shipments. Revenue protection represents another crucial advantage. West African governments lose millions annually to customs fraud, cargo diversion, and underdeclaration of goods values. When paper based systems dominate and different countries can’t communicate electronically, tracking goods becomes nearly impossible once they leave the first border. SIGMAT’s real time monitoring makes it far harder for unscrupulous traders to game the system. The platform builds on earlier pilot programs that demonstrated viability. Nigeria and Benin Republic launched SIGMAT connectivity in May 2025 at the Seme Krake border, a critical junction on the Abidjan Lagos corridor that handles massive trade volumes. That pilot showed the technical feasibility of connecting different national customs systems and highlighted both successes and challenges that informed subsequent rollouts. Nigeria’s Comptroller General of Customs noted at that May launch that the concept was conceived over a decade ago, designed to improve goods visibility in transit, combat diversion and fraud along trade corridors, foster inter agency coordination, and reduce trade delays. The long development timeline reflects both the technical complexity and the political will required to align different national interests around common regional standards. Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, and Niger successfully implemented SIGMAT interconnections earlier, providing proof of concept that the system works when properly deployed. Those landlocked Sahelian nations have particular incentive to make transit systems efficient given their complete dependence on coastal access. Their experiences offer valuable lessons for this week’s Monrovia launch. However, SIGMAT faces real implementation challenges. Many West African countries struggle with unreliable electricity, poor digital infrastructure, and inconsistent internet access. A digital customs platform only works as well as the underlying connectivity supporting it. If power fails or internet drops at critical border points, the entire system risks grinding to halt, potentially creating worse bottlenecks than the paper systems it replaces. Political will represents another variable. Customs policies vary significantly across ECOWAS member states, reflecting different national interests, economic priorities, and revenue needs. Some countries depend heavily on customs revenue and may resist transparency that could reduce collections in the short term, even if regional integration benefits everyone long term. Getting fifteen countries to implement common standards and maintain consistent enforcement requires sustained political commitment. There’s also the human factor. The most sophisticated digital system proves useless if border agents, customs officers, and traders don’t understand, trust, or use it properly. Training programs must reach thousands of personnel across multiple countries, explaining not just how SIGMAT works technically but why it serves everyone’s interests. Resistance from officials comfortable with existing systems, or who benefit from current inefficiencies, could quietly undermine implementation. For Liberia specifically, hosting this launch carries symbolic importance. The country has worked hard rebuilding its institutions and economy following years of civil conflict, and serving as the venue for significant regional initiatives demonstrates its reintegration into West African leadership. Successfully implementing SIGMAT could help Liberia strengthen its position as a reliable trade partner and transit hub. The timing also matters for regional integration efforts more broadly. ECOWAS continues pursuing its vision for an integrated West African economy with free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. Plans for a common currency, the ECO, target 2027 launch despite delays and challenges. SIGMAT represents tangible progress on integration that affects real traders and real goods today, building confidence that broader regional projects can succeed. Trade facilitation through digital systems aligns with global trends as well. Countries worldwide are digitizing customs operations through platforms like UNCTAD’s ASYCUDA system, which twelve ECOWAS members already use as their national customs software. SIGMAT’s ability to integrate with ASYCUDA creates technical foundations for sustainable expansion as more countries join. The broader economic implications could prove substantial. Faster, cheaper, more reliable cross border trade enables businesses to plan better, invest more confidently, and access larger markets. Small and medium enterprises particularly benefit when trade barriers fall, since they lack the resources that larger firms use to navigate complex customs procedures. If SIGMAT delivers promised improvements, it could unleash entrepreneurial energy across the region. For development partners supporting SIGMAT, the platform represents exactly the kind of regional public good worth investing in. Unlike projects benefiting single countries, SIGMAT creates network effects where value increases as more members join. German cooperation through GIZ reflects European interest in stable, prosperous West Africa as migration pressures and security concerns make regional development a strategic priority. Friday’s launch won’t solve all West African trade challenges instantly. Corruption, poor infrastructure, inconsistent regulations, and weak institutions will continue constraining commerce regardless of how well SIGMAT functions technically. But the platform addresses genuine problems in ways that create measurable improvements for stakeholders across the trade ecosystem. As customs chiefs and technical experts finalize preparations this week, they’re working on something that transcends routine government technology projects. SIGMAT embodies a vision where West African borders become connectors rather than barriers, where goods flow efficiently supporting economic growth, and where regional integration moves from aspiration toward reality one digital connection at a time. Whether SIGMAT fulfills its promise depends on sustained commitment across multiple countries over years of implementation. The Monrovia launch represents an important milestone, but true success will be measured by how many trucks cross borders faster, how much revenue governments collect more efficiently, and how many businesses thrive thanks to reduced trade friction across this dynamic but fragmented region.",2025-10-31 21:25:55,News Ghana,neutral,0.5604,0,Economy_Prosperity_Sector
We were never meant to be anonymous,"I was born in Bangkok, Thailand — a metropolis of over 11 million people — and studied in Boston and Chicago. Today, I call Harmony, Minnesota home — a town along the Root River with a population boasting just over 1,000 people. Despite my affection for small town living, I still think of my urban upbringing fondly, and still salivate thinking of my favorite ramen restaurant in Chicago. Yet, in the midst of so many options of where to eat, who to befriend, where to spend my time, I also know that most of my city experiences included sitting in a crowded train, head down, with my face buried in my phone and clueless to the people around me. I was often more of a consumer of community, rather than a creator. I could go through a whole day and be completely anonymous. And while periods of anonymity can help you explore new parts of yourself, ultimately I don’t believe humans are meant to live anonymous lives. In an age of digital connection and hyper mobility, it’s easy to forget the quiet power of being known. Not just recognized, but truly known — by name, by story, by contribution. The poet Wendell Berry once wrote, “A community is the mental and spiritual condition of knowing that the place is shared, and that the people who share the place define and limit the possibilities of each other's lives.” That’s not just poetic — it’s a blueprint for vitality. Here in southern Minnesota, we see this truth play out every day. Our small towns are not just dots on a map; they are ecosystems of relationship. The barista who remembers your order, the neighbor who plows your driveway without asking, the school board member who provides in-home child care to your new infant — these are not coincidences. They are the fabric of a life that resists anonymity. At Southern Minnesota Initiative Foundation, we invest in this fabric. We believe that economic development is inseparable from human development. That thriving communities are built not just on infrastructure, but on trust. And that the vitality of a place depends on the visibility of its people. Just this month, we approved 23 Small Town Grants totaling $200,000 to support projects focused on creating a sense of belonging for all and are in the process of approving Taylor Rural Improvements Grant applications that can make a big impact on the vibrancy of small towns. When I tell you about why I love Harmony, it’s not just that we have four restaurants, a distillery and a grocery store all along our downtown drag — but that I can tell you about the chef who comes out of the kitchen to sing Pink Pony Club with his five-year-old daughter at open mic night, or the couple who moved from New Mexico to open a maker space for the community because they fell in love with a run-down building that they believed they could bring back to life. Our community knows their stories, and they show up to wrap their support around them. To us, it’s not just the end product but the process and people it takes to get there. Similarly, when SMIF supports early childhood programs, we’re not just preparing kids for school — we’re anchoring families in a shared future. When we fund local entrepreneurs, we’re not just boosting the economy — we’re affirming that dreams belong here. And when we partner with towns to support community initiatives, we’re not just contributing resources — we’re contributing to a sense of belonging. Berry’s words remind us that community is not a luxury — it’s a necessity. Humans were never meant to live anonymous lives. We are meant to be accountable, celebrated, challenged and cherished. That’s what small towns offer, both to long-time residents and the newcomers from across the state, country or from across the world, who help our small towns remain vital. And that’s why we must continue to invest in them — not just with dollars, but with belief. Before my predecessor retired, he launched the Tim Penny Small Towns endowment fund to establish a long-term investment vehicle dedicated to that very belief. Today, I get the honor of continuing to grow our Small Town Fund and invite those of you reading to join me. Because in the end, vitality isn’t measured by population size. It’s measured by the strength of connection. And in southern Minnesota, connection is our greatest resource. As always, I welcome your comments and questions. You can reach me at benyak@smifoundation.org or 507-455-3215.",2025-10-31 21:24:17,Austin Daily Herald,neutral,0.5486,4,Business_Businesses_Underway
'Why did he promise it?': Poilievre criticizes Carney for not securing U.S. trade deal,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is questioning why Prime Minister Mark Carney promised he could handle U.S. President Donald Trump, given that the two countries have yet to finalize a trade agreement that would see Canada granted some tariff relief. Speaking to CBC’s Rosemary Barton Live, Poilievre said Carney has not delivered on what he promised during the spring election campaign. “Mr. Carney promised a good deal by July 21. He promised he could negotiate a win with President Trump. Those were his promises,” he told host Rosemary Barton. “Some might say, ‘Look, it’s unrealistic to expect to get that from President Trump.’ So why did he promise it? It wasn't just that it was a promise. It was the promise.” Carney’s key message during the spring election campaign was centred around dealing with the U.S. administration. Negotiators were working toward a potential deal on tariffs until Trump abruptly called off trade talks in a late-night social media post last week. The president said his decision was due to an advertisement by the Ontario government that uses former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's own words to send an anti-tariff message to American audiences. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said Carney apologized for the ad, which was pulled off the air on Monday — but not before it was played over the weekend, including on American networks during the World Series. “I have a very good relationship [with Carney]. I like him a lot, but what they did was wrong. He was very nice. He apologized for what they did with the commercial,” Trump said on Friday in a scrum with reporters on Air Force One. The Prime Minister's Office has not confirmed whether Carney personally apologized for the ad. Trump also said he has no plans to resume trade talks with Canada. When asked how he would handle the relationship with Trump, Poilievre argued boosting the economy would put Canada in a position of strength and rang off some of his promises to get major projects built. But he suggested that speculating if his approach would work better than Carney’s isn’t helpful at the moment because he isn’t prime minister. “What we do know is that Mr. Carney is prime minister — has been for seven months — and these are the results that he's got,” he said. “His failures abroad are costing us at home.” The full interview with Poilievre will air on Rosemary Barton Live, Sunday at 10 a.m. ET.",2025-10-31 21:23:38,Yahoo!

Cuomo courts Sliwa voters in Russian NYC neighborhood — warning against danger of socialist Zohran Mamdani,"Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo made an appeal to Republican voters in Brooklyn’s Russian-speaking enclave Friday — warning them a vote for GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa will only help socialist Zohran Mamdani get elected. The independent mayoral candidate positioned himself as the only viable option to beat the front-runner Democratic nominee, campaigning alongside firebrand Republican Councilwoman Inna Vernikov in Brighton Beach. “There is no way Curtis Sliwa can actually win. Curtis Sliwa can only make Zohran Mamdani win,” Cuomo said, recalling President Trump’s brutal prognosis of the Guardian Angels founder’s chances in the Nov. 4 election. “Don’t believe me. Believe President Trump if you’re a Republican” Cuomo told voters at the Ocean View Cafe, a Ukrainian restaurant on Brighton Beach Avenue. “President Trump said Curtis Sliwa is not ready for prime time.” Vernikov, a staunch Republican who nonetheless endorsed Cuomo over her party’s nominee this week, recalled the local community is largely made up of “families who escaped the former Soviet Union.” “They escaped communism and socialism. A lot of people here are Jewish immigrants. They escaped antisemitism,” she said. “We came to America for the American dream, for capitalism, for the free market economy, for opportunities for our children. “And what we’re seeing now is everything that we escaped, communism, socialism, antisemitism is coming back into New York City.” The local councilwoman, for the 48th District, previously supported Sliwa for mayor — but changed her tune to back Cuomo after seeing polling results showing the veteran Democrat had a better chance of beating socialist Mamdani. “Curtis Sliwa cannot be mayor because he is not winning … the only one who can beat Mamdani is Governor Andrew Cuomo,” she said, referring to recent polls that show Cuomo between 10 to 25 points behind Mamdani and Sliwa lagging by 25 to 29 points. The councilwoman — who was arrested in 2023 for wielding a firearm at a pro-Palestinian rally — referred to Mamdani as a “communist and an antisemitic” to her constituents. Mamdani, who identifies as a democratic socialist, last week held a press conference slamming the rhetoric spewed by his opponents as Islamophobic — which Cuomo and Sliwa have denied. Daniel Kurzyna, a spokesperson for Sliwa, said the concerted effort from Vernikov and Cuomo to siphon the GOP standard-bearer’s voters was “not needle-moving whatsoever.” “Curtis will shock the world,” he said. A rep for Mamdani did not respond to the Post’s request for comment.",2025-10-31 21:23:27,New York Post,neutral,0.8229,1,Economic_Economies_Korea

Investing in affordable rental homes in North Vancouver,"NORTH VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 31, 2025 /CNW/ - Solving Canada's housing crisis requires immediate action to build up supply and bring down costs. The Government of Canada is stepping up with unprecedented investments to supercharge housing construction in Canada. To that end, the federal government launched Build Canada Homes, a new federal agency that will build affordable housing at scale, including transitional and supportive housing, deeply affordable and community housing, and affordable homes for the Canadian middle class. As we build a strong Canadian housing sector, purposeful collaboration will be essential. That means working together with the private and non-profit sectors to bring down costs and build homes at a scale and pace not seen in generations. These investments are also providing Canadians with increased access to affordable and sustainable housing. The Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) provides funding through low-interest and/or forgivable loans or contributions to partnered organizations for new affordable housing and the renovation and repair of existing, affordable and community housing. Today, the Honourable Gregor Robertson, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure and Minister responsible for Pacific Economic Development Canada was joined by the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Member of Parliament for North Vancouver – Capilano, and Linda Buchanan, Mayor of the City of North Vancouver toured the first phase of an ambitious affordable housing project at 144 St Georges Avenue, which is nearing completion and which received support from the federal government. The second phase of this project is receiving $84.5 million in funding to help build 179 secure, affordable rental homes at 120 St Georges Avenue. They also This is an example of the Government of Canada's commitment to investing in affordable housing right across the country The 18-storey, mass timber building will provide housing for singles, couples, families, and seniors in North Vancouver. The rental homes will range in size from studio to three-bedroom units. This is the second phase of the North Shore Neighbourhood House Hub Redevelopment, which is a multi-partner project on City-owned land that supports the City's ongoing commitment to increasing rental housing and community-based services. When all three phases are completed, it will provide rental housing, a new North Shore Neighbourhood House (NSNH), a respite centre with 18 overnight beds and 25 adult daycare spaces, and a redesigned Derek Inman Park. Budget 2025, to be tabled next week, will build on this momentum with further measures to lower costs for builders, catalyse private capital, and work towards doubling the pace of homebuilding across Canada. Budget 2025 will spend less on government operations and reduce waste, so we can invest more to grow our economy, build more homes, and make life more affordable for you. Quotes: ""We need to build more, build better and build bolder. Through investments in rental housing, our government is supporting those who need it most, here in North Vancouver and across the country. We are committed to strengthening communities through initiatives like this one."" — The Honourable Gregor Robertson, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure and Minister responsible for Pacific Economic Development Canada ""The Government of Canada is committed to increasing housing supply to enable enhanced affordability. I have been watching progress on what will be an 18-storey mass timber building – the new home to our beloved community services provider, the North Shore Neighbourhood House. Its 179 rental homes, from studios to three-bedroom units, will be a step forward for housing in North Vancouver – which is a real issue for many who live here. . It's an example of what's possible when all levels of government and the private sector work together. It's also another step forward in our ambitious plan to build Canada strong."" — The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Member of Parliament for North Vancouver—Capilano ""The development at 120 St. Georges Avenue is a great example of how BC Builds is transforming housing delivery in our province. With federal support, we're bringing 179 new rental homes and a revitalized North Shore Neighbourhood House to life as quickly as possible. This project shows what's possible when we work together to build vibrant, inclusive communities."" — The Honourable Christine Boyle, BC Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs ""We welcome the federal government's contribution to our BC Builds project at 120 St. Georges Ave. Better known as Phase 2 of the North Shore Neighbourhood House Redevelopment Project, this investment means real homes for people in North Vancouver. It means child care spaces, wellness programs, and a renewed a community hub that reflects the heart of the community.""— The Honourable Bowinn Ma, MLA for North Vancouver-Lonsdale ""As housing costs continue to rise, it's become increasingly difficult for people to live close to where they work,"" said Linda Buchanan, Mayor of the City of North Vancouver. ""This vital new funding from the Government of Canada is an investment in our shared commitment to building affordable, inclusive communities. The Hub Redevelopment offers a transformative solution—delivering affordable homes, strengthening essential services, and ensuring a vibrant, thriving community for generations to come."" — Linda Buchanan, Mayor, City of North Vancouver ""Catalyst Community Developments Society is grateful to the Government of Canada for making this investment in homes for people in North Vancouver possible. This project shows how strong federal leadership and committed local partners can deliver affordable homes close to where people live and work. At Catalyst, we're ready to do more—in partnership with the Federal Government—to accelerate housing solutions that help more people and strengthen more communities. It's also heartening to see Canada's commitment to housing realized through community-based non-profit organizations like Catalyst."" — Scott Dutchak, President, Catalyst Community Developments Society Quick Facts: Additional Information: SOURCE Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) © 2025 Benzinga.com.

"COP 30: Tinubu Okays National Carbon Market Framework, Climate Fund","Ahead of the 30th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 30) in Brazil, President Bola Tinubu has approved the adoption of a National Carbon Market Framework, the operationalisation of the Climate Change Fund and the restoration of the National Council on Climate Change (NCCC) to the budget line. The goal was to establish and manage Nigeria’s participation in carbon markets, enabling the nation to unlock between $2.5billion and $3billion annually in carbon finance over the next decade to help meet climate goals. The approvals followed a presentation by the Director General of NCCC, Mrs Omotenioye Majekodunmi, at the second meeting of the Council held on Thursday evening at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. President Tinubu, who was represented by Vice President Kashim Shettima, said the approvals were part of measures by his administration to properly position Nigeria to leverage opportunities in the global carbon market and be more active in climate change ecosystem. According to a statement by presidential spokesman, Stanley Nkwocha, the Nigerian leader also set the agenda for Nigeria ahead of the forthcoming COP 30 scheduled for Belem, Brazil, saying the focus was to harness all of the opportunities for financing climate resilient projects and related interventions, particularly from the global carbon market. The President said his administration recognised the fact that addressing climate change was not just an environment imperative but an opportunity to unlock new investments, jobs and innovations across the nation’s energy, agriculture and industrial sectors. He said, “Nigeria stands ready to takes its rightful place as a global leader in climate action, ensuring that our voice and our reality are heard and respected in international negotiations. “We have demonstrated this commitment through our active participation in the UNFCCC process, our progress towards implementing our nationally determined contributions and our efforts to mobilize climate finance for adaption and mitigation across all levels of government.” The President assured that as chairman of the Council, climate action will continue to be prioritised in his administration’s development agenda. “We will continue to champion policies that protect our people, strengthen our economy and position Nigeria as a destination for green investment and innovation,” he added. Earlier, the Director-General of the National Council on Climate Change and Secretary to the Council, Mrs. Omotenioye Majekodunmi, informed the council chaired by Vice President Shettima, who represented President Tinubu, that the meeting was timely ahead of the 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 30) scheduled to hold in Brazil. She said the deliberations and decisions of the council would shape how Nigeria is perceived globally and determine how effectively the country can mobilize support to achieve its climate goals. The Council Secretariat expressed its commitment to providing the technical leadership and coordination needed to translate Nigeria’s climate goals into measurable results. Presenting the Council’s progress report, Majekodunmi disclosed that Nigeria is now eligible to access new rounds of climate finance from multilateral funds. Highlighting the Secretariat’s key requests, she said the Council sought the adoption of the National Carbon Market Framework to enable Nigeria unlock between $2.5 billion and $3 billion annually in carbon finance over the next decade. The Council also requested the operationaliszation of the Climate Change Fund to ensure immediate readiness for fund mobilisation and utilisation. The final request was for the Council to restore the NCCC budget line within the annual FAAC allocation to guarantee the financial stability of the Climate Change Fund. The Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, backed the Council Secretariat’s recommendations, noting that Nigeria must secure a strong position within the carbon framework. He assured the Council of the Finance Ministry’s support, including coordination with the ministry’s economic department to host a quarterly Climate Finance Tracking Dashboard.",2025-10-31 21:41:04,Leadership,neutral,0.5805,0,Economy_Prosperity_Sector
Top Democrat presses Trump administration on Argentina 'bailout' during shutdown,"Rep. Jamie Raskin demands transparency from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the Trump administration's $40 billion Argentina deal. FIRST ON FOX: The top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee is demanding increased transparency from the Trump administration on the factors that led it to make its multibillion-dollar gamble on Argentina. In a letter sent Friday to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Robert Citrone, the manager of Discovery Capital Management LLC, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., requested details about their relationship after the Trump administration's announcement of the deal earlier this month. Raskin, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, asked to see any correspondence between Bessent and Citrone on Argentina, the investment and Citrone’s holdings in the country. ""It is imperative that the American people have a full understanding of why, in the midst of a government shutdown, this administration has chosen to orchestrate a $40 billion bailout to Argentina. What specific arrangements were made to accomplish this astounding result?"" Raskin wrote. TRUMP, DEMOCRATS LOCKED IN ENDLESS CYCLES OF PAYBACK AFTER COMEY INDICTMENT AND TARGETING PRESIDENT'S ENEMIES Citrone did not respond to several requests for comment. Russell Dye, a spokesperson for the Republican Judiciary Committee, said the letter represented just the most recent example of Democrats' fixation on critiquing the administration’s decisions. ""Democrats should focus on opening the government and paying federal workers, many of whom live in ranking member Raskin’s district, rather than obsessing over President Trump. But, sadly, their priority will always be attacking President Trump instead of paying the troops, air traffic controllers and families who are hurting,"" Dye said. FOX NEWS POLITICS NEWSLETTER: CORNYN'S 'CROOKED POLITICIANS' CRACKDOWN The Trump administration announced that it facilitated $20 billion in private financing for Argentina alongside a $20 billion currency swap, providing a financial backstop for a country that has struggled for years to find its footing amid high inflation. The investment aims to help Argentina manage its debts as the value of its currency, the Argentine peso, continues to fluctuate. The decision to direct American dollars toward Argentina raised accusations from Democrats that the investment carried political undertones meant to benefit Argentine President Javier Milei, a figure closely aligned with the Trump administration. Like Trump, Milei entered office in 2023 with promises to shrink the government’s footprint and bring down the country’s costs. But more than just the political undercurrents, Democrats like Raskin argue that some figures close to the administration — like Citrone — may receive collateral benefits as a result. ""In October 2024, you said that ‘the probability of default in Argentina is minuscule.’ Yet, in the past couple of months, a run on the Argentinian peso has put the country’s economy — and your hedge fund’s massive investments — on the brink of collapse. Suddenly, President Trump and Secretary Bessent announced the United States would take ‘exceptional measures’ to stabilize Argentina’s markets. The total amount of assistance for Argentina is a whopping $40 billion,"" Raskin wrote. Citrone and Bessent previously worked together for George Soros in 2013, according to statements Citrone made in a Goldman Sachs podcast. According to the reporting from the Securities and Exchange Commission , Discovery Capital’s exposure to Argentina is high, but not as high as it used to be. Discovery’s investments with companies based in or conducting business in Argentina have scaled down since December 2024. The fund’s investments in 2025 are tens of millions of dollars below levels from a year before. Citrone’s exposure in connection with Argentina is still north of $100 million, according to the SEC. RUBIO BLASTS 'DISHONEST' DEMOCRATS FOR TYING HIM TO 'FAKE' TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS In addition to demanding more information about Bessent's thinking on Argentina, Raskin blasted the decision to invest in Argentina during an ongoing, 31-day government shutdown. ""The Republican government shutdown has deprived millions of federal workers — including law enforcement and air traffic controllers — of their paychecks and is threatening government programs vital to the American people. But, in the midst of this government-created crisis, the Trump administration has chosen to arrange a $40 billion bailout to Argentina — half of it funded with taxpayer money,"" Raskin wrote.

The independent mayoral candidate positioned himself as the only viable option to beat the front-runner Democratic nominee, campaigning alongside firebrand Republican Councilwoman Inna Vernikov in Brighton Beach. “There is no way Curtis Sliwa can actually win. Curtis Sliwa can only make Zohran Mamdani win,” Cuomo said, recalling“Don’t believe me. Believe President Trump if you’re a Republican” Cuomo told voters at the Ocean View Cafe, a Ukrainian restaurant on Brighton Beach Avenue.Drunk judge caught with her pants down peeing in public — as cops haul away interfering husbandendorsed Cuomo over her party’s nominee this week “They escaped communism and socialism. A lot of people here are Jewish immigrants. They escaped antisemitism,” she said. “We came to America for the American dream, for capitalism, for the free market economy, for opportunities for our children. “And what we’re seeing now is everything that we escaped, communism, socialism, antisemitism is coming back into New York City.”The local councilwoman, for the 48th District, previously supported Sliwa for mayor — but changed her tune to back Cuomo after seeing polling results showing the veteran Democrat had a better chance of beating socialist Mamdani. “Curtis Sliwa cannot be mayor because he is not winning … the only one who can beat Mamdani is Governor Andrew Cuomo,” she said, referring to recent polls that show Cuomo betweenThe councilwoman — who was arrested in 2023 for wielding a firearm at a pro-Palestinian rally — referred to Mamdani as a “communist and an antisemitic” to her constituents.Mamdani, who identifies as a democratic socialist, last week held a press conference slamming the rhetoric spewed by his opponentsDaniel Kurzyna, a spokesperson for Sliwa, said the concerted effort from Vernikov and Cuomo to siphon the GOP standard-bearer’s voters was “not needle-moving whatsoever.”Drunk judge caught with her pants down peeing in public — as cops haul away interfering husbandMajor US airport near closure amid government shutdown — and it’s worrying news for Disney fansJulia Fox calls bloody Jackie Kennedy Halloween costume a ‘statement’ about ‘protest and mourning’‘The View’ co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin calls for ‘justice for Sydney Sweeney’ after actress bares it all on red carpet Kennedy scion Jack Schlossberg outraged by Julia Fox’s ‘desperate’ and ‘disgusting’ Jackie O Halloween costumeGiants' ball carriers must be extra careful against 49ers | Blue RushCuomo met voters in the Russian-speaking enclave -- hoping to siphon off support from GOP candidate Curtis Sliwa.Mamdani held a press conference slamming the rhetoric spewed by his opponents as Islamophobic.

"The British government ‘must recognise hydrogen’, says Hyundai","Q: There’s a well-worn joke in motoring circles that hydrogen fuel-cell cars are ten years from becoming mainstream … and have been since the 1960s. That’s when General Motors introduced its first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle concept. But as Hyundai launches a new and improved version of its hydrogen car, the company’s UK president is urging the British government to recognise the technology as a key part of a “global hydrogen economy”. Not doing so could risk the UK being left behind. According to data from H2stations.org, at the end of 2024 there were 748 hydrogen refuelling stations in operation across Asia — China being the global leader with 384 locations across the country. Hyundai’s native South Korea is second, with 198 stations, and almost every service area along its motorway network now includes hydrogen refuelling. Europe is also investing in its hydrogen refuelling network, with 294 locations in operation across the Continent by the end of last year. Of these, 113 were in Germany, with 65 in France, 25 in the Netherlands and 19 in Switzerland. But the UK passenger car refuelling network is lagging behind, and the number of places to top up a hydrogen tank has gone into reverse in recent years. In 2019 there were ten publicly accessible H₂ filling stations in the UK, but today the figure stands at two: one at Heathrow (Hatton Cross) and the other in Tyseley, Birmingham. Two hydrogen fuel cell cars are on sale in the UK: the Toyota Mirai and the Hyundai Nexo. Hyundai says it has sold 40,000 Nexo cars worldwide, with its domestic market having the most sales. However, it is believed fewer than 20 have been registered in the UK since it was put on sale here in 2019, with most used as demonstration vehicles by companies with an interest in developing the hydrogen economy. The focus in the UK is shifting towards the operation of buses and commercial vehicles that support the demand for the growth of hydrogen, with existing and planned hydrogen hubs for these vehicles scattered around the country, including in Aberdeen, Dundee, the Tees Valley, Merseyside, Suffolk and south Wales. This follows more than £2 billion in government funding for 11 projects, including Whitelee Green Hydrogen in Scotland, one of whose customers will be the InchDairnie distillery in Fife, which is aiming to distil its whisky sustainably by 2027. The initial Hydrogen Allocation Rounds funding has also gone towards the Bradford Low Carbon project, which will use renewable electricity to power a 24.5mW alkaline electrolyser to supply clean hydrogen to the likes of JCB, and Wrightbus, which developed the world’s first hydrogen-powered double-decker bus. Twenty-seven projects were selected earlier this year for the second round of funding, known as HAR2, which includes £400 million of private sector investment. These could use hydrogen to decarbonise their manufacturing and industrial processes, including ammonia production, new clean power generation, glass manufacturing, brick-making, and sustainable aviation fuel production. Hyundai is banking on this commercial hydrogen economy growth alongside that of passenger cars. “Hydrogen will become a key pillar of the global clean energy ecosystem — not only in mobility, but also in energy and industry,” said Ashley Andrew, the UK president of Hyundai and its sister brand Genesis. “Hyundai views hydrogen as essential to achieving carbon neutrality, especially in sectors that are hard to fully electrify, such as commercial transport, logistics and industrial applications. “We expect hydrogen to expand beyond passenger vehicles into commercial vehicles, trains, maritime and even future home and industrial energy systems.” This week, Hyundai broke ground on a new hydrogen fuel cell production facility in Ulsan, South Korea, following an investment of nearly £500 million. The 43,000 sq m facility, which is set for completion in 2027, will mass-produce 30,000 fuel cell units annually. It will also include advanced polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysers. These split hydrogen from oxygen in water molecules, and the gas can then be compressed and stored in tanks. It’s the recombining of hydrogen with oxygen from the air in a fuel cell that generates electrical energy, with water being the by-product. PEMs run on renewable energy, such as solar, and transportation in zero-emission vehicles results in a green power ecosystem. When created via fossil fuels the resulting gas is known as grey, brown or black hydrogen, as the process is not genuinely clean. The Ulsan ground-breaking ceremony also involved hydrogen-powered vehicles, including lorries, excavators, boats, tractors and forklifts. “Hydrogen accelerates carbon neutrality by addressing the intermittency of renewables and enhancing energy resilience,” said Jaehoon Chang, the vice-chairman of Hyundai Motor Group. “Hydrogen also stands out as a strategic energy carrier, enabling localised generation and distribution systems — such as off-grid and micro-grid ecosystems — which reduce reliance on centralised grids and strengthen communities’ self-sufficiency.” Hyundai’s investment in the technology includes advances in efficiency for the new Nexo, with the fuel cell output up 11 per cent, battery output up 100 per cent and the electric motor output up 33 per cent compared with the previous-generation Nexo. Combined with aerodynamic improvements, its range on a single charge of hydrogen has increased from 414 miles to 513 miles, and the Nexo now has a towing capacity of up to 1,000kg (the previous model was not rated for towing at all). It takes about five minutes to refuel completely. The company is developing its hydrogen passenger cars alongside its hybrids and battery electric vehicles (Bevs), such as the Ioniq 5, the Ioniq 6 and the Kona Electric. Hyundai Motor Group also sells Bevs under the Kia and Genesis brands. The firm expects the two technologies to continue to coexist. “Bevs may be more suitable for short-distance applications without the need for quick charging, while FCEVs, with their exceptional energy density and rapid-refuelling capabilities, will conquer long and medium-haul trucking,” Andrew said. “The hydrogen industry remains in a growth phase and will continue to advance through close collaboration between industry and government, as public-private partnerships are key to expanding infrastructure. “To meet zero-emission vehicle mandates and accelerate fleet decarbonisation, government must recognise hydrogen as a strategic enabler, and maintain openness to all viable technologies that support medium to long-term climate goals.” CAR CLINIC October 23 2025, 1.20pm Tim Shallcross October 16 2025, 6.00pm Adam Hay-Nicholls car clinic October 07 2025, 8.00pm Tim Shallcross October 31 2025, 11.00pm David Green November 01 2025, 4.00am Anna Murphy, Fashion Director October 31 2025, 11.00pm Anna Murphy",2025-10-31 21:45:37,The Times,neutral,0.8185,1,Economic_Economies_Korea
