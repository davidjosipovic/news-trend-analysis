Here's CBA's latest Australian interest rate forecast,"Image source: Getty Images You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More If you've been hoping for another RBA interest rate cut this year, the economists at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) have some bad news for you. CBA revised its outlook for rate relief Down Under following yesterday's widely unexpected surge in inflation. News which sent the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) into a tailspin in early afternoon trade on Wednesday. The prospect of ASX 200 investors or Aussie mortgage holders seeing another 2025 interest rate cut from the RBA all but vanished yesterday after the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicator rose 1.3% in the September quarter and 3.2% annually. That marks the highest quarterly inflation increase since March 2023 and was well ahead of market expectations. The annual inflation print was the highest level since the June 2024 quarter. As for trimmed mean annual inflation, which removes certain volatile items and is the metric favoured by the RBA, it came in at 3% for the September quarter, up from 2.7% in the June quarter. This was the first time trimmed mean annual inflation rose since December 2022, and it came in well above the RBA's forecast of 2.6%. Which brings us to… Commenting on the surprise surge in inflation, Belinda Allen, head of Australian economics at CBA, said, ""This result will be a genuine concern for the RBA. We expect the central bank to take a more hawkish tone to avoid a return to higher inflation."" The RBA meets next week and announces its interest rate decision on Tuesday. As for that upcoming meeting, CBA said, ""We expect the cash rate to be held steady at 3.60%."" Unfortunately for ASX investors patiently waiting until 2026 for the next rate cuts, CBA also believes those are off the table for now. According to the ASX 200 bank: Given the material upside surprise to the Q3 25 CPI, and the broad-based nature of pricing pressures, we now expect the RBA to remain on hold from here. Previously we expected one last rate cut in February 2026 to bring the cash rate back closer to neutral. So, what will it take for Aussie to get some rate relief? ""We expect it would take a material move higher in the unemployment rate, together with more moderate inflation prints, to bring the RBA back to the cutting table,"" CBA said. Could, gasp, the next RBA interest rate move actually be higher? According to CBA, that's certainly a possibility, with the bank noting ""the latest data has tilted the risks to the upside"". CBA concluded, ""If inflation remains elevated in 2026, as we expect it could, the RBA may need to act.""",2025-10-30 04:39:40,Fool Australia
"Business : Xi Jinping Urges Partnership With Us, Says Frictions Are 'normal' Between Economic Powers","KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 30 (Bernama) -- China and the United States (US) should be partners and friends, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his meeting with his counterpart Donald Trump at the Gimhae Air Base in Busan, South Korea, while stating that it is normal for two economic powerhouses to have frictions at times. Trump called Xi a great leader, “President Xi is a great leader of a great country, and I think we are going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it is an honour to have you with us. Thank you very much.” Xi said, “China’s relations have remained stable on the whole (and) given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then and in the face of winds, waves and challenges.” “You and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course and ensure the steady sailing forward of the giant ship of China-US relations. I always believe that China’s development goes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again,” he said in the video that was streamed live by The White House. Xi said both leaders have spoken over the phone three times, exchanged several letters, and stayed in close contact since Trump’s re-election. He said both Beijing and Washington are fully able to help each other succeed and prosper together. “Over the years, I have stated in public many times that China and the US should be partners and friends. This is what history has taught us and what reality demands,” Xi said. Xi said that in the latest round of consultation, both economic and trade teams have reached a basic consensus on addressing respective major concerns and made encouraging progress. Earlier in his opening remarks, Trump also mentioned the consensus that has been reached. “I think we have already agreed to a lot of things, and we will agree to some more right now,” said Trump. Xi said the consensus provided the necessary conditions for their meeting today. He said, “Mr President, I am ready to continue working with you to build a solid foundation for China-US relations and create a sound atmosphere for the development of both countries.” Meanwhile, Trump also said Xi is a “very tough negotiator”, and a China-US trade deal could be signed between the two countries. Xi also expressed his appreciation for Trump’s contribution to the recent conclusion of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. “Mr President, you care a lot about world peace, and you are very enthusiastic about settling various regional hotspot issues. I appreciate your great contribution to the recent conclusion of the Gaza ceasefire agreement,” he said. The Chinese President also mentioned the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord, signed in Kuala Lumpur by Cambodia and Thailand. He said China has been helping, in its own way, for both countries to settle their border disputes, and that it has also been promoting peace talks to resolve other hotspot issues. “The world today is confronted with many tough problems. China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world,” he said. Both leaders are in South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Week, which is taking place in Gyeongju, a coastal city. Malaysia is a founding member of APEC, an intergovernmental forum comprising 21 economies. Collectively, the APEC economies contribute approximately 61 per cent of global gross domestic product and 46 per cent of world trade, underscoring their pivotal role in driving international economic growth and integration. With a population exceeding three billion, the APEC region continues to serve as a key engine of global development and is projected to expand by 2.9 per cent in 2026, reflecting its resilience and enduring economic potential. -- BERNAMA BERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.

All about glass bead art,"African glass bead art has been a part of cultural expression for centuries, combining traditional techniques with modern aesthetics. This art form has evolved, yet retained its roots, showcasing the rich heritage and creativity of African artisans. From intricate patterns to vibrant colors, glass bead art continues to captivate audiences worldwide. Here are five fascinating aspects of this unique artistic tradition. #1 Glass beads have been a part of African culture since ancient times. They were used for trade, adornment, and spiritual purposes. The introduction of European-made glass beads in the 15th century revolutionized the industry, making them more accessible. Today, these beads are still used in traditional ceremonies and contemporary fashion alike. #2 The art of bead-making is passed down generations, with artisans perfecting their craft over the years. Traditional techniques include melting raw materials and shaping them into small spheres or tubes. Modern innovations have introduced new colors and shapes, but the basic methods remain largely unchanged. #3 Each design in African glass bead art carries cultural significance. Patterns may depict social status, tribal affiliation, or personal identity. Colors also have meanings; for example, red may symbolize strength, while blue could represent peace. Understanding these symbols adds depth to appreciating this art form. #4 The production and sale of glass beads provide a source of income for many communities across Africa. Artisans often work in cooperatives that support fair trade practices and sustainable development initiatives. The global demand for authentic African beadwork helps preserve this tradition while contributing to local economies. #5 In recent years, there has been a resurgence in popularity for African glass bead jewelry among fashion enthusiasts around the world. Designers are incorporating these vibrant pieces into modern wardrobes, highlighting their versatility as both statement accessories and subtle embellishments. This trend not only celebrates cultural heritage but also encourages ethical consumerism through supporting artisan communities.",2025-10-30 04:38:32,Newsbytes
"Fed Meeting: Second Rate Cut Of The Year Announced, Benchmark Rates Lowered By 0.25%","The U.S. Federal Reserve just cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percent, which lines up with what most people on Wall Street expected. It's the second time they've trimmed rates this year, dropping the policy range to 3.75 to 4 percent. The vote wasn't unanimous either—out of twelve members, ten wanted this cut, one didn’t want any change, and another actually wanted an even bigger cut of 0.5 percent. The Fed didn’t give much of a hint about what they're planning for December. Back in September, they said there could be three more cuts in 2025, but for now, everyone’s waiting for the next meeting in December. After the announcement, markets bounced around—stocks jumped at first, then got shaky after the Fed Chair made his comments. So, what does the Fed say about the economy? In their official statement, they said things are still growing, but not too fast. Job growth is slowing down, and unemployment has ticked up a bit, though it’s still low. Inflation is higher than it was at the start of the year and isn’t coming down yet. The Fed keeps pointing to its two big goals: keeping unemployment low and hitting that 2 percent inflation target. Lately, with job risks creeping up, they decided a 0.25 percent rate cut was the right move to balance things out. They’re keeping a close eye on economic trends and global issues before making any more decisions. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke, markets got even more jittery. He said there’s a lot of disagreement inside the Fed about what to do in December, and it’s just too soon to say if there will be another cut this year. Stocks, which had gone up right after the rate cut, quickly lost those gains as investors digested his remarks. One more wrinkle: a government shutdown has held up a bunch of important economic reports. Even with some data missing, the Fed said they had enough information from both public and private sources to make the call. The shutdown has made it harder for agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect data. The White House warned that if this drags on, key inflation reports could be delayed, which could mess with how everyone judges the economy.",2025-10-30 04:38:10,The Free Press Journal
"Asian Stocks Erase Gains After Trump-Xi Talks, Yen Falls: Markets Wrap","US equity-index futures erased gains and Asian shares lost momentum after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping ended their summit that was aimed at easing the trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Contracts for the S&P 500 were flat after the underlying gauge erased gains following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s warning that a rate cut in December isn’t a foregone conclusion. Asian shares gave up earlier gains to trade 0.1% lower. The technology sector remained in focus after Samsung Electronics Co.’s earnings beat estimates, and megacap US companies boosted bets on the artificial intelligence theme. The yen fluctuated against the dollar after the Bank of Japan held its policy rate. Gold was flat after four days of declines, while a gauge of the dollar trimmed gains from the prior session. Treasuries recouped some of their losses with the yield on the 10-year declining one basis point to 4.06%. Markets are looking past the Fed’s cautious stance on further rate cuts and turning their focus to the ongoing Trump–Xi meeting, which investors hope will ease the world’s largest trade dispute and steady global markets after months of tension. The artificial intelligence theme and spending by megacap companies were also in focus as big technology names started reporting earnings. Trump earlier said the US and China “could” sign a trade deal Thursday as the two leaders started a high-stakes meeting. The two leaders were set to finalise a détente at their South Korea meeting to put the world’s biggest trade fight on hold — at least for now. Earlier, following the Fed’s expected rate cut, Powell’s caution about future moves and his focus on labor market risks led investors to scale back easing bets. Fed officials delivered their second straight rate reduction Wednesday to support a softening labor market, and said they would stop shrinking the portfolio of assets on Dec. 1. Governor Stephen Miran dissented again in favor of a larger reduction. Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid said he preferred not to cut rates at all. Investors also got a chance to price in tech companies spending on artificial intelligence after earnings from megacaps. Three bellwethers – Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — together racked up some $78 billion in capital expenditures last quarter. That’s up 89% from a year earlier. Their earnings were mixed. Meta Platforms shares fell 7.4% in extended trading while Alphabet jumped 6.7%. Microsoft fell almost 4%. Earlier in the US trading day, Nvidia Corp. became the first company to reach $5 trillion in market valuation. “Even though the Fed communication was more hawkish than the market had expected, the news of Nvidia’s market cap exceeding $5 trillion and Alphabet’s favorable earnings announcement are supporting tech-related stocks in Asia,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. Some of the main moves in markets: S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% as of 1:16 p.m. Tokyo time Japan’s Topix rose 0.3% Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.5% Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.5% The Shanghai Composite was little changed Euro Stoxx 50 futures rose 0.2% The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1% The euro rose 0.2% to $1.1625 The Japanese yen was little changed at 152.74 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.0957 per dollar Bitcoin fell 1.4% to $109,904.42 Ether fell 1.8% to $3,881.47 The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 4.06% Japan’s 10-year yield was unchanged at 1.655% Australia’s 10-year yield advanced seven basis points to 4.29% West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.4% to $60.22 a barrel Spot gold rose 0.3% to $3,942.76 an ounce",2025-10-30 04:37:12,Ndtv Profit

"‘Friction Is Natural, But Ties Must Stay On Track’: Xi Jinping Urges Trump For China-US Partnership","Chinese President Xi Jinping met his American counterpart Donald Trump in South Korea on Thursday, marking their first meeting in six years. During the talks, Xi emphasised that Beijing and Washington must remain partners and friends, acknowledging that differences were “natural” but urging both nations to stay on the “right course.” “It is natural to have friction,” Xi said, adding, “China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish more great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world.” He also expressed appreciation for Trump’s efforts to promote peace in ongoing global conflicts, reiterating China’s willingness to continue working with the United States. In response, President Trump described Xi as “a great leader of a great country,” adding, “I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it's an honour to have you with us.” The two leaders met at an air base in the southern port city of Busan, with the encounter taking place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. This was also the first meeting since Trump’s return to office in January this year. As the two leaders shook hands, Trump remarked, “We are going to have a very successful meeting, I have no doubt. But he is a very tough negotiator.” The meeting came against the backdrop of renewed US-China trade tensions, which have persisted since 2018. The dispute reignited earlier this month after China proposed expanding curbs on exports of rare-earth minerals, a key component for high-tech manufacturing where Beijing holds global dominance. In response, Trump announced plans to impose additional 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods and hinted at further restrictions on exports involving US software - a move that analysts warned could severely disrupt the global economy. Following urgent negotiations between senior officials, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Beijing might delay the rare-earth export restrictions for a year and resume purchases of US soybeans, a vital export for American farmers. Just ahead of the APEC Summit, Reuters reported that China had bought its first cargoes of US soybeans in several months, signalling tentative progress towards easing trade tensions.

Euro zone growth beats forecasts as France outperforms,"The euro zone economy grew quicker than expected last quarter as buoyant consumption offset faltering exports and persistent struggles in Germany's oversized industrial sector, fresh data from Eurostat showed on Thursday. The economy of the 20 nations sharing the euro expanded by 0.2% in the third quarter, beating expectations for a 0.1% increase in a Reuters poll, with France and Spain growing well above average, balancing out stagnation in Germany and Italy. On an annualised basis, the economy grew by 1.3%, ahead of expectations for 1.2%, a level economists consider to be around its natural rate of growth without stimulus. Spain remained the best performer among the bloc's largest economies, growing by 0.6% on the quarter, in line with forecasts, while France expanded by 0.5%, beating expectations for 0.2%. Germany and Italy meanwhile both stagnated. Thursday's figures ease pressure on the ECB to cut interest rates any further in the near term as they confirm the bank's long standing view that the economy is proving resilient to this year's unusual spike in uncertainty. While trade tensions, lingering uncertainty and Chinese dumping of surplus goods could still weigh on growth in the months ahead, economists remain relatively upbeat about the outlook and ECB projections suggest that last quarter may have been the worst for some time. Growth could pick up as past interest rate cuts work their way through the economy, households sit on ample saving, Germany boosts spending, uncertainty over tariffs eases and inventories have already run low. Indeed business activity, measured by a key purchasing managers survey, is already showing a pick up, sentiment in Germany, the bloc's biggest nation, is improving and business are becoming more optimistic, partly over lower tariff uncertainty. But any growth pick up is likely to be modest as the rigid structure of the euro zone economy limits activity, say economists, who predict growth in the 1.2% to 1.5% range for years to come.

Marcos leaves for APEC meet in South Korea,"(UPDATE) PRESIDENT Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday departed for South Korea to participate in the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ Meeting, where he will promote the Philippines and push for stronger regional trade and investment ties. Marcos left Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on board the presidential plane with first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos for the summit scheduled from Oct. 30 to Nov. 2 in Gyeongju, South Korea. In his departure statement, Marcos said the growth and stability of the Asia-Pacific region were directly tied to the opportunities and welfare of all Filipinos, as the region accounts for nearly 46 percent of global trade in goods and commercial services, and generates around 61 percent of global gross domestic product. “So, given these high stakes, this gathering is imperative. We convene at a critical juncture, defined by evolving geopolitical landscapes, supply chain disruptions, threats of climate change, and the urgent need for equitable and inclusive growth,” Marcos said. Citing the theme of this year’s APEC gathering, “Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect. Innovate. Prosper,” Marcos said the Philippines was committed to accelerate physical and digital connectivity, as well as digital transformation for competitiveness, and ensure stable and equitable prosperity for all Filipinos. “Our collaboration with the Republic of Korea and all APEC economies is pivotal. We will forge deeper ties around our shared goals and objectives, including fostering AI-driven innovation, enhancing cultural and creative industries, and proactively addressing demographic challenges,” the president said. “This collective resolve will ensure that our development efforts align with regional progress, laying the groundwork for a future where the power of creativity, technology and sustainability benefits every Filipino,” he added. Marcos said his engagements with the leaders of economies in the Asia-Pacific region would focus on “actionable areas” consistent with his administration’s long-term vision under AmBisyon 2040. He said these areas were guaranteeing equitable access to digital services and financial inclusion, particularly in underserved rural areas; advancing seamless movement of goods and people through investment facilitation and infrastructure development; promoting supply chain resiliency amid shocks and crises; and promoting digital literacy and skills development for micro, small and medium enterprises, women, and other segments who can realize their full economic potential through digitalization. The president said he was scheduled to address the APEC CEO Summit, an annual gathering of top CEOs in the region, where he would showcase the Philippines’ commitment to fostering economic partnerships and promoting a favorable business climate, aligned with the government’s vision of building a strong, innovation-driven economy. “Among others, we will highlight how we are pursuing digital transformation as a core pillar of our development, fully recognizing the potential of new technologies to unlock a more prosperous and resilient future,” said Marcos, who is heading to the APEC meetings after a four-day visit in Malaysia for the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Summit and Related Summits. Coming from the 47th Asean Summit, the president said he would lobby for stronger collaboration with regional partners, including Asean, to achieve the shared objectives for a sustainable, technologically empowered and inclusive future. “As the chair[man] of Asean in 2026, our goal is to impart that working silos impede the region’s potential. Real growth and lasting prosperity are achievable when we break down barriers, share knowledge, and collaborate across sectors, industries and communities,” he said. On the sidelines of the APEC meetings, President Marcos will meet with South Korean business leaders to deepen trade ties, attract investments and strengthen people-to-people cooperation. “I want to use this moment to reaffirm a core truth to the international business community: The Philippines is not merely ready. We are a reliable, forward-looking partner in the Asia-Pacific. Invest in the Filipino,” he said. Marcos also looked forward to meeting the Filipino community in Busan for the first time, where Filipinos thrive and make meaningful contributions to the city’s socioeconomic growth and further strengthen the enduring people-to-people ties between the Philippines and South Korea. Meanwhile, Marcos said that the ongoing meeting between United States President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would influence discussions at APEC, saying any agreement between the two economic powers would have global ripple effects. “The world is watching because this is the source of the largest shock that has entered into the world trade system. And we have to see what the agreements will be coming out of these meetings between President Xi and President Trump,” Marcos said. “Those will certainly color everything that we will be talking about in this APEC because the agreements or the arrangements that are made between two of the largest economies of the world will certainly affect every single citizen of the world,” he added. Trump kicked off a meeting with Xi at a South Korean air base on Thursday, optimistic about striking a trade-war truce between the world’s two largest economies. “We are going to have a very successful meeting, I have no doubt. But he is a very tough negotiator,” Trump said, as he shook hands with Xi. A few days ago, trade negotiators for both countries reached a “fundamental consensus on addressing each other’s primary concerns,” Xi said. “I am willing to continue working with President Trump to lay a solid foundation for China-US relations,” he added. During the president’s trip, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin will head the three-man government caretaker committee, with Agrarian Reform Secretary Conrado Estrella III and Education Secretary Sonny Angara as members. Part of Marcos’ delegation are Presidential Communications Acting Secretary Dave Gomez, Foreign Affairs Secretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro, Trade Secretary Cristina Roque, Migrant Workers Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac, Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick Go, and Palace Press Officer Claire Castro. Established in 1989, the regional economic forum aims to harness the growing interdependence of the Asia-Pacific region to promote greater prosperity for its people. Marcos’ attendance this year marks his return to the summit after skipping last year’s meeting in Peru to focus on the government’s disaster response efforts.",2025-10-30 04:48:12,The Manila Times
Giving stalling car industry a break on petrol-engine ban could be a mistake,"A law banning petrol and diesel engines in new cars by 2035, supposed to be one of the main planks of Europe’s ambitious green agenda, has become the latest front in a Brussels tug of war between climate and industrial policy. The law is part of the European Union’s efforts to become climate neutral by the middle of the century, by phasing out polluting cars and encouraging people to switch to greener electric vehicles (EVs). You will still be able to buy second-hand petrol or diesel cars after 2035, but new vehicles coming off the manufacturing lines will have to be battery-powered. The combustion engine ban, which was approved by the European Parliament and national governments two years ago, is in the sights of the stalling car industry. Volkswagen, BMW and other big German carmakers, which Berlin has rowed in behind, are looking for leeway on the deadline and specific carveouts. The fight cuts across several big questions policymakers are wrestling with: climate targets, the level of regulation from Brussels, Europe’s sluggish economy and the threat of China eating the EU’s lunch. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, whose “green deal” reforms introduced the 2035 engine ban during her first term at the helm of the EU’s powerful executive body, is under pressure to walk it back. The commission president has promised a review of the ban by the end of this year, which is expected to outline proposed changes. German chancellor Friedrich Merz is on a mission to strip back EU regulations he views as a burden on European industry. The plan to stop any new carbon dioxide-emitting cars being produced in 10 years is at the top of his list. There, he has a friend in Manfred Weber, the conservative German MEP who leads the European People’s Party (EPP), the centre-right grouping that dominates the European Parliament. Merz, Weber and von der Leyen all belong to the same political family in German politics, a home constituency the commission president can’t be seen to ignore. Definitely not when Germany’s industrial engine – the auto sector – is feeling the financial pinch and laying off workers. The review of the combustion engine ban will have to be a tidy piece of politics. Von der Leyen needs to give something to the car industry, but still hang on to the broad ambition of her legislation. That something might be scope for the car industry to keep producing hybrids, with both electric and combustion engines, beyond 2035, or a delay in the cut-off. Promising more help to car manufacturers developing their EV battery supply in Europe could be another sweetener. Giorgia Meloni’s hard-right Italian government has lined up beside Germany in opposition to the 2035 ban. The French and Spanish governments have been fighting a rearguard action in defence of the EU pivot to electric vehicles. A paper authored by France and Spain, circulated to diplomats in Brussels last week, said Europe didn’t stand a chance of hitting its climate targets if it failed to gradually get people to shift away from petrol and diesel cars. The paper, seen by The Irish Times, called for the review to “preserve the 2035 cap” and the environmental ambition behind it. The two big countries said that did not mean the auto industry could not be allowed some “flexibilities” to smooth its transition to EV production, but any leeway needed to be contingent on companies manufacturing their cars in Europe, not abroad. Ban or no ban, Europe is up against the clock to produce affordable electric vehicles. China is making moves to take over as much of the market as it can. Beijing has pumped huge amounts of state resources into industries it thinks will dominate the coming decades, from renewable energy to artificial intelligence and electric and self-driving vehicles. Trade hawks in the European Commission are concerned that China is halfway around the track and Europe is still lacing up its runners. The danger is that Chinese-made EVs, manufactured by say BYD, can seriously undercut European competitors on price, over time snuffing out domestic EV production here and leaving Europe reliant on China for its cars. Last year, the EU slapped defensive tariffs on imports of EVs from China to compensate for what the commission deemed to be an unfair leg-up Beijing gives its industry, which was allowing Chinese manufacturers to flood the European market. Pushing out the 2035 cut-off point for petrol and diesel engines might give European car manufacturers a break in the short term, but it won’t help them catch up to their Chinese rivals in the electric vehicle race.",2025-10-30 04:48:00,The Irish Times
Labor Slashes Regional Funding Again,"The Regional Development Victoria (RDV) annual report has revealed grants have been cut by $15 million, or 11 per cent, compared to the previous year. Four years ago, RDV had a total grants pool of $370 million to support development in the regions. Last year, it was just $118 million – a 70 per cent drop. But what is just as damning is the staffing wages bill at RDV. Employee expenses in the last financial year totalled $27.9 million – up 17 per cent from $23 million the previous year. To put it simply, regional Victorians are paying more for public servants, but getting less in return in development grants. Leader of The Nationals and Shadow Minister for Regional Development and Liveability, Danny O’Brien, said Labor is continuing to ignore regional Victorians. “The great divide continues. Labor is leaving regional Victorians out in the cold,” Mr O’Brien said. “It is impossible to justify a 70 per cent cut in grants for regional development across the past four years. “These grants are so important in supporting jobs, infrastructure and helping local economies flourish and thrive.” Mr O’Brien also questioned the staffing cost blow-out. “If RDV is delivering less grants and programs, why is it spending more in wages? Clearly, there’s less work to do,” Mr O’Brien said. “This is a double-edged sword. Regional Victorians are receiving less and paying more for the privilege because Labor can’t manage money.”",2025-10-30 04:47:44,The National Tribune
"Trump, Xi talks wrap up with outcome unclear","China has agreed to keep rare earth exports flowing to the world as part of a one-year agreement, President Donald Trump said on Thursday shortly after meeting his counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea. The agreement, which Trump provided few details about except that it would probably be extended, would ""settle"" the issue, he said. China has yet to comment on what was agreed by the two leaders in talks, which ran for almost two hours. ""All of the rare earth has been settled,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. ""And that's for the world, worldwide, you could say this was a worldwide situation, not just a U.S. situation."" ""There is no roadblock at all on rare earth. That will hopefully disappear from our vocabulary for a little while."" Rare earths, 17 elements which play tiny but vital roles in cars, planes and weapons, have emerged from obscurity to become China's most potent source of leverage in its trade war with the United States. Export controls introduced in April caused widespread shortages overseas, especially for magnets, forcing some automakers to pause production before exports rebounded following deals between Beijing and Washington and the European Union to free up the flow. China expanded those controls again in October, taking the total number of elements restricted to 12 and adding much of the equipment used to process them. The expanded controls are set to come into force in early November and it is unclear whether the agreement discussed by Trump covers the full suite of China's rare earth export controls or just the October extension. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, also on the flight, said China would not be imposing its proposed rare earth controls after an understanding between the presidents. He did not comment on controls that are already in place.",2025-10-30 04:47:02,The Korea Times

Instant View: Market analysts react to Trump-Xi meeting,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump held talks with China's Xi Jinping at a South Korean air base on Thursday, with both leaders sounding optimistic about cooling trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. Market reaction was fairly muted as investors awaited further details of any agreement with Chinese stocks holding steady near a 10-year peak. Here are some comments from market analysts and investors: TARECK HORCHANI, HEAD OF DEALING, PRIME BROKERAGE, MAYBANK SECURITIES, SINGAPORE: ""The U.S.–China trade truce is likely to be greeted as a relief rally rather than a structural reset. When such truces occur, one of the first areas both sides highlight is agriculture, a politically sensitive sector in the U.S. where farmers form a key constituency. ""Overall, this looks like a tactical pause rather than a strategic breakthrough, with underlying tensions in technology, supply chains and rare earths still unresolved."" DICKIE WONG, HEAD OF RESEARCH, KINGSTON SECURITIES, HONG KONG: ""I don't see there's any major optimistic surprise at this point, both for the markets and the U.S.-China talks. It's still that same question - after the meeting ends, does it really mean the two countries will have a joint statement, and then the U.S. will roll back all tariffs on China, drop tech curbs, and China will export rare earths again? I don't see any possibility. ""The markets have already priced in much of the positives and there could be an 'anti-climax' development."" MUHAMMAD SAIFUDDIN BIN SAPUAN, ECONOMIST, KENANGA INVESTMENT BANK, KUALA LUMPUR: ""I think this is a tactical pause rather than a structural shift as both likely aim to ease tensions. But the truce will help stabilise global sentiment and trade expectations in the short term, which offers a relief for global demand and supply chain. ""Nevertheless, we still think that structural decoupling between the U.S. and China will continue to shape the long-term outlook.""

5-year wait ends: Bengaluru’s delayed Hosakerehalli flyover finally set to open in November,"The long-delayed Hosakerehalli flyover on Outer Ring Road (ORR), near PES College in southwest Bengaluru, is finally nearing completion and is expected to open to traffic by mid-November. The 500-metre structure was planned to ease congestion at one of the city’s busiest junctions but has faced repeated delays since its launch. The project began in August 2020 with an initial deadline of just 15 months. However, more than five years, around 64 months have passed since then. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) faced criticism for the prolonged delay, prompting the recently formed Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) to issue a 15-day ultimatum for completion, as per a report by Times of India (TOI).

Once operational, the flyover is expected to ease bottlenecks at the PES College junction and improve traffic movement in the area, offering long-awaited relief to thousands of daily commuters.

During the interaction, residents highlighted a range of civic concerns, from pending infrastructure projects and flooding to traffic chaos and poor connectivity in the Koramangala–Ejipura corridor. The meeting centred on the stalled flyover project, which began before 2019, halted midway, and was recently revived under a new contractor.",2025-10-30 05:23:26,Hindustan Times
Trump cuts China tariffs to 47pc after ‘amazing’ Xi meeting,"BUSAN, Oct 30 — US President Donald Trump said today he had agreed to reduce tariffs on China to 47 per cent in exchange for Beijing resuming US soybean purchases, keeping rare earths exports flowing and cracking down on the illicit trade of fentanyl. His remarks after face-to-face talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the South Korean city of Busan, their first since 2019, marked the finale of Trump’s whirlwind Asia trip on which he also touted trade breakthroughs with South Korea, Japan and South-east Asian nations. “I thought it was an amazing meeting,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One shortly after he departed Busan, adding that tariffs imposed on Chinese imports would be cut to 47 per cent from 57 per cent. Trading in global stocks was choppy as Trump revealed details of the deal, with major Asian indexes and European futures swinging between gains and losses. China’s Shanghai Composite Index slipped from a 10-year high, while US soybean futures were weaker. World stock markets from Wall Street to Tokyo had hit record highs leading up to the meeting on hopes of a breakthrough in a trade war between the world’s two largest economies that has upended supply chains and rocked global business confidence. The meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, lasted nearly two hours. Trump shook hands and escorted Xi to his car before the US president was given a red-carpet send-off at the airport. Trump repeatedly talked up the prospect of reaching agreement with Xi since US negotiators on Sunday said they had agreed a framework with China that will avoid 100 per cent US tariffs on Chinese goods and achieve a deferral of China’s export curbs on rare earths, a sector it dominates. But with both countries increasingly willing to play hardball over areas of economic and geopolitical competition, many questions remain about how long any trade detente may last. — Reuters",2025-10-30 05:22:52,Malay Mail

The ministry had also added new vocational and trade subjects to the curriculum, including digital literacy, solar installation, agricultural entrepreneurship, and garment making. This is intended to entrench practical skills from an early age and prepare students for the demands of the modern job market. According to the minister, the total number of subjects a student would offer would be streamlined across different grade levels to reduce “content overload” and enable deeper learning. The government has converted federal science and technical colleges into modern technical colleges. This includes free tuition and stipends for students, with a curriculum that is 80 per cent practical and 20 per cent theoretical. Alausa has also emphasised the need for ongoing education reforms to move beyond policy declarations and deliver practical outcomes that strengthen skills, innovation, and job creation among young people. According to him, the ultimate goal of the reforms is to ensure that students are not only educated but also equipped with the competencies required to thrive in a fast-changing global economy. He explained that the Federal Government was working to align education with the needs of the labour market through curriculum review, improved teacher training, and investment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.

Alausa said: “Our reforms must go beyond the paperwork of policy; they must impact classrooms, teachers, and ultimately the learners. Education should not end with certificates but open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity.” According to him, the ministry is prioritising partnerships with the private sector and development agencies to expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research, and digital learning. “If we are to build a competitive economy, we must invest in the skills and knowledge base of our young people so that they can become drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added. The NEG Meeting brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including policymakers, education administrators, academics, and development partners, to deliberate on strategies for improving education delivery and learning outcomes across all levels. Participants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector. During the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population. He added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole. CONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities The President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction. Sunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform. However, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation. Reiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective. He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” A major part of the reforms is the restructuring of the national curriculum for basic, senior secondary and technical education, which commenced this academic year.

The NEG Meeting brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including policymakers, education administrators, academics, and development partners, to deliberate on strategies for improving education delivery and learning outcomes across all levels. Participants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector. During the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population. He added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole. CONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities The President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction. Sunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform. However, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation. Reiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective. He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” Alausa has also emphasised the need for ongoing education reforms to move beyond policy declarations and deliver practical outcomes that strengthen skills, innovation, and job creation among young people. According to him, the ultimate goal of the reforms is to ensure that students are not only educated but also equipped with the competencies required to thrive in a fast-changing global economy. He explained that the Federal Government was working to align education with the needs of the labour market through curriculum review, improved teacher training, and investment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.

Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” Alausa said: “Our reforms must go beyond the paperwork of policy; they must impact classrooms, teachers, and ultimately the learners. Education should not end with certificates but open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity.” According to him, the ministry is prioritising partnerships with the private sector and development agencies to expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research, and digital learning. “If we are to build a competitive economy, we must invest in the skills and knowledge base of our young people so that they can become drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added. The NEG Meeting brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including policymakers, education administrators, academics, and development partners, to deliberate on strategies for improving education delivery and learning outcomes across all levels. Participants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector. During the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population. He added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole. CONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities The President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction. Sunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform. However, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation. Reiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective. He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said.

A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” During the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population. He added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole. CONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities The President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction. Sunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform. However, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation. Reiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective. He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation.

Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” He advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue. Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers 960,000 youths to get technical vocational training English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment Sunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes. “Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said. He also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process. “Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added. Drawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and innovations birthed). “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended. There must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist An education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it. Orji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction. He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning. Orji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. “I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy. “I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity. The government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education is reassuring, and I urge all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produce tangible benefits for learners and the nation. “I’m confident that these reforms will bring about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national prosperity,” he said. ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted.

ASUP-Imopoly Chairman: minister’s position is on the right track According to the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics Imo State Polytechnic (ASUP-Imopoly) Julius Chigozie Offurum, the minister’s position is on the right track. He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment. Offurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens. The Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more. Offurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate. “To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice. “Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted. These are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman Abia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” He reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning.

"The Grand Egyptian Museum showcasing 50,000 artifacts is finally opening","CAIRO: After two decades of anticipation and countless delays, the Grand Egyptian Museum is finally having its grand reveal. The museum, which is set to officially open Saturday, highlights Egypt’s ancient civilization and is a centerpiece of the government’s drive to boost the tourist industry, a major source of foreign currency in the cash-strapped country. Located just outside Cairo next to the famed Giza Pyramids, the $1 billion mammoth facility is poised to become the world’s largest museum dedicated to a single civilization with over 50,000 artifacts detailing the life in ancient Egypt. By comparison, the Louvre Museum in Paris has about 35,000 pieces on display. The museum is one of the mega-projects championed by President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, who since taking office in 2014 embarked on massive investments in infrastructure with the aim of reviving an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered by the unrest that followed the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. The museum’s construction began in 2005, but work stopped for three years during the political turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising. The grand opening was postponed multiple times, most recently in July this year because of conflicts in the Middle East. World leaders are expected to attend the opening ceremony Saturday. Giant building with a view of the Giza Pyramids Designed by the Irish firm Heneghan Peng Architects, the museum, known as GEM, boasts a towering, triangular glass façade imitating the nearby pyramids. In its entrance atrium stands the granite colossus of one of Egypt’s most famed pharaohs, Ramesses the Great. The 3,200-year-old, 11-meters-tall (36-foot-tall) statue was moved to the museum after decades of standing in the center of a traffic-clogged roundabout in front of Cairo’s main train station. From the atrium, a grand six-story staircase lined with ancient statues leads up to the main galleries and a view of the nearby pyramids. A bridge links the museum to the pyramids, allowing tourists to move between them either on foot or via electric, environment-friendly vehicles, according to museum officials. The museum includes 24,000 square meters (258,000 square feet) of permanent exhibition space, a children’s museum and conference and educational facilities, and a commercial area as well as a large conservation center. The 12 main galleries, which opened last year, exhibit antiquities spanning from prehistoric times to the Roman era, organized by era and by themes. Many of the 50,000 artifacts in the GEM were moved from the Egyptian Museum, a packed, century-old building in downtown Cairo’s Tahrir Square. Others were recently unearthed from ancient cemeteries, including the Saqqara necropolis, another complex of pyramids and tombs about 14 miles (22 kilometers) south of the museum. The halls are equipped with advanced technology and feature multimedia presentations including mixed-reality shows to help explain ancient Egypt to new generations, said Ahmed Ghoneim, the museum’s CEO. “We’re using the language that the Gen Z uses right now,” he said in an interview. “Gen Z doesn’t use anymore the labels that we read as old people but rather use technology.” Tutankhamun collection in one place for the first time Saturday’s grand opening will include the inauguration of two halls dedicated to the 5,000 artifacts from the collection of King Tutankhamun. The collection is being displayed in its entirety for the first time since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered King Tut’s tomb in 1922 in the southern city of Luxor. The old Egyptian Museum didn’t have enough space to show all the tomb’s treasures at once. Some masterpieces were restored at the museum’s conservation center, including the boy pharaoh’s three funeral beds and six chariots, said Jailan Mohamed, chief restorer at the conservation center. They will be displayed along with his golden throne, his gold-covered sarcophagus and his burial mask, made of gold, quartzite, lapis lazuli and colored glass. The mask’s beard was accidentally knocked off and hastily glued back on with epoxy in 2014, before a German-Egyptian team of experts fixed it the following year. Another centerpiece of the museum is the 4,600-year-old solar boat of King Khufu, the pharaoh who is credited with building the Great Pyramid of Giza. The 43-meter-long (140-foot) wooden boat, discovered in the 1950s, was buried next to the Great Pyramid for Khufu — or Cheops as he is also known — to use in the afterlife. In 2021, it was moved from its display site by the pyramids into the Grand Egyptian Museum on a remote-controlled vehicle imported from Belgium. The government hopes that the museum will revitalize tourism The government hopes the museum will draw more tourists who will stay for a while and provide the foreign currency Egypt needs to shore up its economy. The tourism sector suffered from years of political turmoil and violence following the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. In recent years, the sector has started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the effects of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine are a major source of tourists visiting Egypt. A record number of 15.7 million visited the country in 2024, according to official figures, and the government aims to attract 30 million visitors by 2032. Authorities overhauled the whole area around the museum and the pyramids. Roads were paved and a metro station is being constructed outside the museum gates to ease access to the sites. An airport, Sphinx International Airport, was also opened west of Cairo — 40 minutes from the museum. Hassan Allam, CEO of Hassan Allam Holding, the firm administering the museum, said they’re expecting between 15,000 and 20,000 visitors a day at the museum. “The world has been waiting … Everyone’s excited,” he said.",2025-10-30 05:21:41,Arab News Pk
Trump says tariffs on China are dropping from 57% to 47% after talks on fentanyl curbs with Xi Jinping,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump described his face-to-face with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday as a roaring success, saying he would cut tariffs on China, while Beijing had agreed to allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans. The president told reporters aboard Air Force One that the U.S. would lower tariffs implemented earlier this year as punishment on China for its selling of chemicals used to make fentanyl from 20% to 10%. That brings the total combined tariff rate on China down from 57% to 47% “I guess on the scale from 0 to 10, with ten being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,” Trump said. “I think it was a 12.” Trump said that he would go to China in April and Xi would come to the U.S. “some time after that.” The president said they also discussed the export of more advanced computer chips to China, saying that Nvidia would be in talks with Chinese officials. Trump said he could sign a trade deal with China “pretty soon.” Xi said Washington and Beijing would work to finalize their agreements to provide “peace of mind” to both countries and the rest of the world, according to a report on the meeting distributed by state media. “Both sides should take the long-term perspective into account, focusing on the benefits of cooperation rather than falling into a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation,” he said. Despite Trump’s optimism after a 100-minute meeting with Xi in South Korea, there continues to be the potential for major tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Both nations are seeking dominant places in manufacturing, developing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and shaping world affairs like Russia’s war in Ukraine. Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs since returning to the White House for a second term, combined with China’s retaliatory limits on exports of rare earth elements, gave the meeting newfound urgency. There is a mutual recognition that neither side wants to risk blowing up the world economy in ways that could jeopardize their own country’s fortunes. When the two were seated at the start of the meeting, Xi read prepared remarks that stressed a willingness to work together despite differences. “Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other,” he said through a translator. “It is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then.” There was a slight difference in translation as China’s Xinhua News Agency reported Xi as telling Trump that having some differences is inevitable. The leaders met in Busan, South Korea, a port city about 76 kilometers (47 miles) south from Gyeongju, the main venue for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. In the days leading up to the meeting, U.S. officials signaled that Trump did not intend to make good on a recent threat to impose an additional 100% import tax on Chinese goods, and China showed signs it was willing to relax its export controls on rare earths and also buy soybeans from America. Officials from both countries met earlier this week in Kuala Lumpur to lay the groundwork for their leaders. Afterward, China’s top trade negotiator Li Chenggang said they had reached a “preliminary consensus,” a statement affirmed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who said there was “ a very successful framework.” Shortly before the meeting on Thursday, Trump posted on Truth Social that the meeting would be the “G2,” a recognition of America and China’s status as the world’s biggest economies. The Group of Seven and Group of 20 are other forums of industrialized nations. But while those summits often happen at luxury spaces, this meeting took place in humbler surroundings: Trump and Xi met in a small gray building with a blue roof on a military base adjacent to Busan’s international airport. The anticipated detente has given investors and businesses caught between the two nations a sense of relief. The U.S. stock market has climbed on the hopes of a trade framework coming out of the meeting. Pressure points remain for both US and China Trump has outward confidence that the grounds for a deal are in place, but previous negotiations with China this year in Geneva, Switzerland and London had a start-stop quality to them. The initial promise of progress has repeatedly given way to both countries seeking a better position against the other. “The proposed deal on the table fits the pattern we’ve seen all year: short-term stabilization dressed up as strategic progress,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “Both sides are managing volatility, calibrating just enough cooperation to avert crisis while the deeper rivalry endures.” The U.S. and China have each shown they believe they have levers to pressure the other, and the past year has demonstrated that tentative steps forward can be short-lived. For Trump, that pressure comes from tariffs. China had faced new tariffs this year totaling 30%, of which 20% were tied to its role in fentanyl production. But the tariff rates have been volatile. In April, he announced plans to jack the rate on Chinese goods to 145%, only to abandon those plans as markets recoiled. Then, on Oct. 10, Trump threatened a 100% import tax because of China’s rare earth restrictions. That figure, including past tariffs, would now be 47% “effective immediately,” Trump told reporters on Thursday. Xi has his own chokehold on the world economy because China is the top producer and processor of the rare earth minerals needed to make fighter jets, robots, electric vehicles and other high-tech products. China had tightened export restrictions on Oct. 9, repeating a cycle in which each nation jockeys for an edge only to back down after more trade talks. What might also matter is what happens directly after their talks. Trump plans to return to Washington, while Xi plans to stay on in South Korea to meet with regional leaders during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which officially begins on Friday. “Xi sees an opportunity to position China as a reliable partner and bolster bilateral and multilateral relations with countries frustrated by the U.S. administration’s tariff policy,” said Jay Truesdale, a former State Department official who is CEO of TD International, a risk and intelligence advisory firm. ___ Ken Moritsugu in Beijing and Seung Min Kim and Michelle Price in Washington contributed to this report.

The Latest: Trump says he has deals with China after meeting Xi to solve months of trade tensions,"President Donald Trump said he has made deals with China after meeting Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, the final day of a trip to Asia that was an opportunity for the leaders of the world’s two largest economies to stabilize relations after months of turmoil over trade issues. Trump made the comments aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington after spending five days in three Asian countries. Javascript is required for you to be able to read premium content.

Florence Press Conference Confirms ECB Remains Comfortable in Its Good Place,"Even a change of scenery has done nothing to change the European Central Bank’s current wait-and-see stance. Florence, where the ECB met today for its only annual meeting outside of Frankfurt, is apparently also this ’good place’, the central bank’s well-known pseudonym for comfortably keeping interest rates on hold. ECB President Christine Lagarde even called it a ‘magnificent’ place – Florence, that is, not rates. The comments at the press conference confirmed once again that the ECB has no intention to leave its ‘good place’ any time soon. We had feared a rather uneventful press conference. What should we say? We hate to be right… Anyhow, here are a few interesting remarks made by Lagarde: On the ECB’s risk assessment, the introductory statement had the most remarkable change compared with September. Last month, the ECB had still talked about risks to the growth outlook that had become “more balanced”; today, it refrained from qualifying any balance of risk. Instead, the central bank had a somewhat more extensive list of upside and downside risks to the growth outlook. Lagarde even said that some of the downside risks had abated. When asked whether this was a sign of an upcoming shift in the balance of risk, the ECB’s President pointed out that it had already narrowed the risks at the September meeting. Funnily enough, back at the September meeting, there had been no mention of a narrowing of risks. Supply chain disruptions. Lagarde referred to a discussion on potential supply chain bottlenecks that could still arise as a result of the latest tensions between China and the EU on microchips and rare earths in general. Risks to inflation. As in the past, the ECB didn’t provide an assessment of the balance of risks to inflation. However, during the press conference, Lagarde mentioned different positions, views and analyses regarding inflation within the Governing Council. These differing views do exist, despite a unanimous decision to keep rates on hold today. A particular concern remains service inflation, which the ECB has often labelled as being too high. Looking ahead, today’s meeting has done nothing to change the view that the bar for yet another rate cut from the ECB is high. In fact, the Bank currently feels very comfortable in its ‘good place’. With the ECB’s own growth forecasts indicating that the eurozone economy will grow by slightly more than 1% each year and inflation will settle down to 2% over the next few years, there is indeed very little reason to change its monetary policy stance. At the same time, there are still valid dovish arguments that could force the central bank to cut again at the December meeting. Just think of the delayed adverse impact of US tariffs, the stronger euro exchange rate, French politics or a delay in Germany’s fiscal stimulus. If any of these downside risks materialise, we can expect the ECB to engage in one or two more rate cuts. On this point, it remains important to note that the current ECB inflation forecast for 2027 includes a 0.2ppt impact from the introduction of the ETS2 system. Needless to say, any delay in the implementation could have implications for the ECB as it would increase the risk of inflation undershooting. Even if Lagarde tried to downplay this issue during the press conference. In any case, even if the ECB seems to rest more comfortably on its laurels than before, the December staff projections will be crucial and could still invade its good place. If the 2028 inflation forecasts come in sub-1.7%, the likelihood of yet another rate cut would increase. More generally speaking, Lagarde didn’t give away any hints at what’s next for the ECB. Maybe the strongest message came from the colours of the President’s scarf, which – at least to us – resembled the French flag. For the rest, today’s meeting was another illustration that the ECB has no intention whatsoever of leaving its ‘good place’ any time soon. *** Disclaimer: This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user’s means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Glen Burnie Bancorp Announces Third Quarter 2025 Results,"Highlights for the Third Quarter of 2025: Year-to-date through September 30, 2025, net earnings were $66,000 compared to a net loss of $72,000 during the same nine-month period in 2024. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2025 was $0.02, compared to a diluted loss per share of $(0.02) during the same period in 2024. ""We are pleased with our results for this quarter as our strategic initiatives that were started over a year ago, continue to improve our balance sheet position and earnings. We are also excited to complete the acquisition of VAWM as we believe that our new subsidiary will help grow our non-interest income, increase our ability to serve new markets, and add a cornerstone product to our expanding line of products and services,” said Mark C. Hanna, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our strategic priorities continue to focus on increasing new revenue sources by growing our client relationships and becoming more operationally efficient. Achieving these objectives will expand our return on assets and capital.” Mr. Hanna added, ""We were also very pleased to see that our deposit base and cost of funding continues to remain competitive and stable while seeing good growth in our loan revenues. With strong liquidity and ample capital, we are very excited about our future and the benefits our strategic initiatives are beginning to produce.” Loan Portfolio Quality/Allowance for Loan Losses The Bank’s asset quality metrics continue to be very good due to our focus on disciplined lending practices. The non-performing loans ratio as of September 30, 2025, was 0.56%, up 40 basis points from the third quarter 2024 and up slightly by 5 basis points from June 30, 2025. During the third quarter of 2025, the Bank had net charge-offs of $93,000 or 0.17% to average loans, as compared to net recoveries of $44,000 or -0.09% in the third quarter 2024, and net charge-offs of $45,000 or 0.09% in the second quarter of 2025. Provision expense was $44,000 in the third quarter 2025 compared to $105,000 for the third quarter 2024, and $79,000 in the second quarter 2025. The Bank’s allowance for loan losses to loans was 1.19% for the third quarter 2025, a decline of 0.02% from the second quarter of 2025 and a decline of 0.14% from the third quarter of 2024. Mr. Hanna noted, ""We continue to see and experience very good credit results and indicators in our markets, while our non-performing assets remain at lower levels. Our allowance for credit losses at 1.19% of loans, highlights our conservative stance on maintaining a healthy reserve on our balance sheet.” Balance Sheet Total loans were $215.3 million at September 30, 2025, an increase of $8.3 million, or 4.0%, from the third quarter of 2024, and $2.0 million from the second quarter of 2025. During the third quarter 2025, total average loans increased $7.3 million from the second quarter 2025 as a result of growth in commercial real estate loans of $2.4 million, $3.8 million of growth in the C&I portfolio, and a $1.1 million increase in consumer loans (automobile). Total deposits were $329.1 million at September 30, 2025, an increase of $14.8 million, or 4.7%, from the third quarter of 2024, and $11.8 million from the second quarter of 2025. Non-interest-bearing deposits, which are 33% of total deposits, were down by $8.6 million, or 7.4%, from the third quarter of 2024, and were relatively unchanged from the second quarter of 2025. Interest-bearing deposits ended at $221.7 million for the third quarter of 2025, a $23.4 million increase from the third quarter 2024, or 11.8%, and an increase of $11.4 million from the second quarter 2025. The Bank’s communities and markets remain very competitive for deposits by customers who are very rate sensitive. Interest-bearing cost of deposits increased on a linked quarter basis to 1.91% in the third quarter of 2025 from 1.78% due to the shift of deposit balances from lower cost deposits to the Bank’s higher rate money market accounts and CDs. Total cost of funds, including noninterest sources decreased 0.04% on a linked quarter basis to 1.32%. During the quarter the bank paid off all advances from the FHLB, which were $30 million at the end of the third quarter 2024 and $13.0 million at the end of the second quarter of 2025. Mr. Hanna commented, ""We are glad to see continued growth in our deposit base as those deposits are a strength of our Bank and a big contributor to our strong liquidity. As of September 30, 2025, our liquidity sources improved to the point where we paid off all FHLB advances by the end of the quarter. We still have many sources for additional liquidity in the form of $50.9 million in borrowing capacity with the FHLB, open pledging capacity of our securities portfolio of $56.8 million, $34.6 million in borrowing capacity with FRB, and additional access to other wholesale funding of $123 million. This additional liquidity capacity will provide the funding we need to create a more customer-based balance sheet as our reliance on investment securities continues to decline while growing commercial loan relationships within our markets and the communities we serve.” The investment securities available for sale was $104.1 million, after the fair value adjustment of $22.3 million at September 30, 2025, with a yield of 2.23% for the third quarter 2025, down $15.8 million from the third quarter of 2024, and down $0.4 million from the second quarter of 2025. The effective duration of the securities portfolio is 7.3 years. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) of $16.2 million was up from $15.7 million when compared to the third quarter of 2024, and down from the second quarter of 2025 by $1.7 million. Changes in the Bank’s AOCL in the investment portfolio are attributable to changes in the economy as bonds with longer maturities are more sensitive to interest rate changes. The Bank does not intend to sell nor buy any new securities as our strategic direction is to grow our balance sheet through new loans instead of increasing our reliance on the securities portfolio. Each of the regulatory capital ratios for the Bank exceeds the well capitalized minimum levels currently required by regulatory statute. At September 30, 2025, the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios (Leverage, Tier I Risk Based and Total Risk Based) were 9.67%, 14.82 %, and 15.96% respectively. These compared to the ratios as of June 30, 2025, of 9.59%, 14.91%, and 16.06% and to September 30, 2024, of 10.11%, 15.47%, and 16.72%, respectively. Revenue Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin Net interest income was $2.8 million for both the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, compared to net interest income of $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2025. The net interest margin for the third quarter of 2025, on a tax equivalent basis, was 3.24% up 10 basis points from the third quarter of 2024 and up 11 basis points from the second quarter of 2025. The increase in the Bank’s net interest margin is due a continued change in the mix of earning assets from lower yielding assets to higher yielding loans. Yields on total loans improved by 15 basis points to 5.73% on a linked quarter basis and were up 4 basis points from the third quarter of 2024, while the total cost of funds was 1.32% in both the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, but down 4 basis points over the second quarter of 2025 from 1.36%. Total earning assets were $354.9 million, down $11.3 million from the third quarter 2024 and down $4.4 million from the second quarter 2025. Mr. Hanna commented, ""We continue to see our mix of earning assets move from cash and securities to a higher percentage of loans. A year ago, in the third quarter of 2024, our loans were 56% of our earning assets where today at the end of the third quarter of 2025, loans represented 61% of our total earning assets, up from 58% in the second quarter of 2025. This is an important and intentional shift in our balance sheet to work around the existing securities portfolio structure.” Non-Interest Income Non-interest income in the third quarter of 2025 was $571,000 compared to $354,000 in the third quarter of 2024 and $220,000 in the second quarter of 2025. Mortgage fees from VAWM for the third quarter of 2025 were $192,000, which was the primary cause of the increased non-interest income. The Bank anticipates continued increases in its non-interest income in the form of mortgage fees due to the acquisition of VAWM. Non-Interest Expense Noninterest expense totaled $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, up $0.3 million from the third quarter of 2024, and relatively equal to the second quarter of 2025. Most of the increase from the third quarter of 2024 was related to non-recurring legal and professional fees from the acquisition of VAWM as well as new operating expenses from VAWM. Salary and related employment benefits were up $211,000 from the third quarter 2024 primarily due to increased headcount at the bank in the latter part of 2024 and new salaries and benefit costs at VAWM. When compared to the second quarter 2025, these costs were down by $161,000 as reductions in headcount in the first and second quarters of 2025 are now being recognized. Salaries and related benefits at VAWM for the third quarter of 2025 were $139,000. Occupancy and equipment expenses, legal, accounting and professional fees, and data processing services combined were up by $89,000 from the third quarter 2024 and up $188,000 from the second quarter 2025 primarily due to increases in legal and professional fees related to the VAWM acquisition and interim finance and accounting consulting help. All other expenses were relatively flat when compared to the third quarter 2024 and second quarter 2025. Acquisition Summary - VA Wholesale Mortgage Incorporated As of the close of business on August 15, 2025, the Bank, a Maryland-chartered bank, completed the acquisition of VAWM, a Virginia corporation engaged in residential mortgage banking, lending, and brokerage services, from Eric Tan, its sole shareholder (""Seller”). Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Bank purchased 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of VAWM for a total purchase price of $750,000, payable under a 36-month, interest-free promissory note. The note provides for monthly forgiveness of one-thirty-sixth of the balance over the term, subject to continuing employment and other specified conditions. Amortization of the note will be treated as compensation expense. In addition, the Seller is entitled to post-closing contingent consideration (""earn-out”) equal to 33% of VAWM’s net earnings plus 0.04% of closed-loan volume for a period of three years following the closing date, estimated to be $298,000 based on historical production and future growth. Earn-out payments are to be determined annually based on VAWM’s financial results, with supporting statements delivered after each year-end. Concurrent with closing, the Seller entered into an employment agreement with the Bank, continuing to serve in a management role to support the integration of the mortgage operations into the Bank’s business. The acquisition was affected through a private stock purchase and did not involve the issuance of any shares by the Bank. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase of a business under ASC 805, with VAWM becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank. The acquisition expands the Bank’s retail mortgage banking capabilities within its existing Mid-Atlantic market footprint. Further details of the financial impacts will be included in the Bancorp’s Financial Statements and Notes in Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2025.

Greece and Canada Explore Year-Round Direct Flight Service from Athens to Boost their Tourism and Business Ties,"Published on November 1, 2025 With the view to upgrading the Greek-Canadian bilateral relations, Greek Minister of Infrastructure and Transport Christos Dimas met with Canadian Transport Minister Steven MacKinnon to discuss a year-round, direct flight between Athens and Canada. The talks came during the Delphi Economic Forum Toronto Edition, where both countries discussed ways to deepen cooperation on aviation, logistics, digital infrastructure, and sustainable mobility. This new airlift will add even more force to tourism exchange between the two nations, which will also create new opportunities for business exchange and economic development.A Strategic Move to Enhance Tourism and ConnectivityThe proposal for a direct Athens–Canada flight comes at a time when both Greece and Canada are working to expand their tourism offerings and economic ties. As tourism demand continues to rise in both countries, establishing a direct air link would significantly reduce travel time and costs, benefiting both tourists and business professionals. With Canada’s large Greek diaspora and Greece’s rich cultural and natural offerings, the new service would not only attract more tourists but also strengthen cultural exchanges and mutual understanding between the two nations.Advertisement Minister Dimas emphasized that the proposed route would help position Greece as a gateway to Europe for Canadian travelers, facilitating access to not only Athens but also Greek islands like Santorini, Mykonos, and Crete. At the same time, it would provide Canadians with a convenient link to explore the rich cultural and natural attractions of Greece. By improving connectivity, Greece and Canada can work together to bolster the tourism sector, creating sustainable growth and offering unique travel experiences for visitors from both countries.Strengthening Economic and Trade RelationsWhile tourism is a key focus of this initiative, the direct Athens–Canada route will also have a substantial economic impact, particularly in trade relations. The proposed flight will help facilitate business exchanges and trade opportunities between Greece and Canada, particularly in industries such as shipping, agriculture, renewable energy, and technology.Advertisement By improving air connectivity, both countries will benefit from easier travel for business professionals, enabling smoother cross-border collaborations and improving the movement of goods and services. For example, Greek exporters will have enhanced access to the Canadian market, while Canadian businesses will find it easier to connect with partners in Greece and Southern Europe. This increased connectivity could also lead to new investment opportunities and a deeper integration of Greek and Canadian economies.A Focus on Sustainable Aviation and Eco-Friendly TravelBoth ministers highlighted the importance of sustainable mobility as part of this potential air service.

As tourism demand continues to rise in both countries, establishing a direct air link would significantly reduce travel time and costs, benefiting both tourists and business professionals. With Canada’s large Greek diaspora and Greece’s rich cultural and natural offerings, the new service would not only attract more tourists but also strengthen cultural exchanges and mutual understanding between the two nations.Advertisement Minister Dimas emphasized that the proposed route would help position Greece as a gateway to Europe for Canadian travelers, facilitating access to not only Athens but also Greek islands like Santorini, Mykonos, and Crete. At the same time, it would provide Canadians with a convenient link to explore the rich cultural and natural attractions of Greece. By improving connectivity, Greece and Canada can work together to bolster the tourism sector, creating sustainable growth and offering unique travel experiences for visitors from both countries.Strengthening Economic and Trade RelationsWhile tourism is a key focus of this initiative, the direct Athens–Canada route will also have a substantial economic impact, particularly in trade relations.

For example, Greek exporters will have enhanced access to the Canadian market, while Canadian businesses will find it easier to connect with partners in Greece and Southern Europe.

Punjab govt readies law to take on land-property mafia,"Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has approved Punjab Protection of Ownership and Immovable Property Ordinance 2025 to deal with those who grab the property of the people. Chairing a meeting in Lahore, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has established Dispute Resolution Committees under Ordinance for the petitioners who have been going through the courts for years. Now every land grabbing case in Punjab will be decided by the Dispute Resolution Committee in just 90 days. A special tribunal set up under the chairmanship of a retired judge of the High Court will hear the appeal against the decision of the Dispute Resolution Committee. The special tribunal will also be bound to decide the appeal within 90. According to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s vision of a state at the doorstep of the people, under the new ordinance, in every district of Punjab Dispute Resolution Committee to be established. Under the new justice system in Punjab, the Dispute Resolution Committee will resolve the issue of possession of private property before going to court.

Recommendation to hire Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (PERA) to free possession from those who grab the property of the people was reviewed in the meeting. Proposals for digital records and social media live streaming for transparency were also reviewed. Maryam Nawaz said no one will snatch anyone’s land in Punjab now, a mother-like state stands with every weak.

OpenAI Launches Paid Tier for Sora AI Video Generations,"In a move that signals the maturation of artificial intelligence tools from experimental novelties to revenue-generating platforms, OpenAI has introduced a paid tier for its Sora video generation app, allowing users to purchase additional credits beyond daily free limits. This development, announced recently, marks a pivotal shift for the company as it seeks to balance accessibility with financial sustainability in the competitive AI space. According to reports, users can now buy bundles of 10 extra video generations for $4, a nominal fee that extends the app’s utility for heavy users who exhaust their complimentary allocations. The Sora app, which debuted on iOS with capabilities to create stunning AI-generated videos from text prompts, initially offered unlimited free generations to foster adoption and feedback. However, as user numbers swell, OpenAI is recalibrating its model to manage computational costs and prevent abuse. Bill Peebles, Sora’s chief, explained in interviews that this pay-for-more approach is the first step in a broader monetization strategy, with plans to reduce free daily limits in the coming months. Monetization Strategies Taking Shape Industry observers note that this pricing structure aligns with OpenAI’s evolving business model, reminiscent of how it transitioned ChatGPT from free access to subscription-based Plus and Enterprise tiers. The Verge detailed how the company is positioning Sora not just as a creative tool but as a potential economic ecosystem, including future licensing for copyrighted characters and cameo features. This could open revenue streams from partnerships with content creators and media firms, potentially transforming Sora into a marketplace for AI-enhanced video production. Moreover, the introduction of paid credits addresses the high operational expenses associated with AI video generation, which demands significant GPU resources. Sources indicate that while the current free tier allows around 30 generations per day, reductions are imminent to encourage upgrades, a tactic echoed in gaming and software industries where freemium models drive premium conversions. Implications for Users and Creators For creative professionals, this change could democratize access to advanced tools while introducing barriers for casual users. Filmmakers and marketers, who rely on iterative generation for projects, may welcome the option to scale up without waiting for resets, but concerns about equity arise. Mashable highlighted user reactions, with some praising the affordability of the $4 bundle, while others worry it foreshadows steeper paywalls that could stifle innovation in underserved communities. OpenAI’s executives have emphasized that this is part of building a “new Sora economy,” including monetized features like reusable avatars and video stitching. As Business Insider reported, the company envisions users earning from their creations, perhaps through integrated marketplaces, blending AI generation with blockchain-like royalty systems. The Broader AI Industry Shift This pivot reflects broader trends in the AI sector, where companies like Google and Meta are also exploring hybrid free-paid models to recoup investments in training massive models. Analysts suggest OpenAI’s strategy could set precedents for how generative AI tools evolve from hype to profitable ventures, especially amid regulatory scrutiny over energy consumption and intellectual property. Critics, however, point to potential downsides, such as increased digital divides. Mint noted that while the iOS-exclusive rollout limits accessibility, expansions to other platforms are planned, potentially broadening reach. As OpenAI navigates these waters, the success of Sora’s paid features will likely influence investor confidence and competitive responses. Future Horizons and Challenges Looking ahead, OpenAI plans to integrate more advanced capabilities, such as higher-resolution outputs and collaborative editing, which could justify premium pricing. Yet, challenges remain, including competition from open-source alternatives and ethical concerns over deepfakes. Engadget reported on the company’s intent to introduce licensing options, allowing brands to protect and profit from their IP within Sora’s ecosystem. Ultimately, this monetization layer underscores OpenAI’s ambition to lead in AI video, turning creative potential into a sustainable business. As the platform matures, it may redefine content creation, blending human ingenuity with machine efficiency in ways that benefit both innovators and the bottom line.",2025-10-31 20:16:16,Webpronews

Highlighting the economic and social value of the new road network, the governor said it would ease transportation difficulties, promote commerce, and enhance connectivity within Sokoto and neighbouring areas. “No economic or social program can succeed without functional infrastructure,” Aliyu noted. “By investing in this road, we are not only easing movement today but securing the economic prosperity of Mabera for tomorrow.” While reaffirming his administration’s commitment to continuous infrastructural renewal across the state, the governor pledged to keep channelling resources into projects that directly improve living standards and open up opportunities for the people. He expressed appreciation to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his leadership and ongoing reforms in the economy and security sectors, assuring that Sokoto would continue to align with the President’s development agenda. “With this commissioning, we are not just opening a road; we are opening a pathway to a brighter future,” he said. In his remarks, Abdulaziz Abubakar Yari, former Zamfara State Governor, praised Governor Ahmed Aliyu for embarking on people-oriented projects, noting that the people of Sokoto State are proud of his leadership. The governor then inaugurated the Mabera Road Network for public use, marking a significant milestone in the state’s infrastructural development. In a symbolic gesture, the governor renamed Katin Sanni Road within the Mabera community after Senator Abdulaziz Yari, the special guest of honor at the event, who is a former Zamfara Governor.",2025-10-31 21:16:53,New Telegraph

"Impound, Don’t Go Nuclear","Eliminating the Senate filibuster would be a boon for the Democrats. President Trump, after completing his highly successful trade and diplomacy trip to the Indo-Pacific region, where he outfoxed and cornered Communist China in so many areas, then wrote a long Truth Social note where he advocated for ending the government shutdown with what is called the “nuclear option.” He wrote: “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW.” I can surely understand Mr. Trump’s frustration with the radical Democratic Party that is being driven by the Mamdani-AOC-Bernie Sanders socialist wing. Yet I do not think ending the filibuster is a good idea. Speaking as someone who strongly supports the president’s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation, energy dominance, reciprocal free trade, closing the border and so forth, I think ending the filibuster would do great damage to those pro-growth policies, which miraculously passed under “one big, beautiful” bill. Mr. Trump himself admits in his Truth Social post that the Democrats fought hard to end the filibuster, but failed. He even notes that ending the filibuster would at some point allow Democrats to pack the Supreme Court, make Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico new states, thereby picking up four senate seats and many House seats and electoral votes from those ultra-liberal places. The Committee to Unleash Prosperity adds to the list it would’ve passed without the filibuster: A national voter ID ban, the Green New Deal, card check for union elections, a $15 minimum wage, a cap-and-trade national energy tax, completely socialized medicine, and the PRO Act’s forced unionization. Let’s not go there. I have a much better idea: presidential impoundment. Mr. Trump’s budget director, Russell Vought, is ready to pull the trigger on non-essential federal employees who will remain non-essential, forever. I call it DOGE 2.0. In short, keep the non-essential non-essential; that’s existential. And all those pork-barrel Democratic spending items that President Biden lined up for his re-election last year, that stuff was so bad it even gives waste, fraud, and abuse a bad name. I’ll be polite: they’re all non-essential. Because the government is presently unfunded, the chief executive has the authority to impound personnel and non-entitlement programs. While Mr. Vought has his weapon locked and loaded, he’s being held back by a lower court judge who has enjoined the administration from taking these actions. Yet all that is on appeal and is likely to be overturned. Unquestionably, Mr. Trump as the chief of the executive branch has the inherent constitutional power to impound during this period. If Democrats come back to power without a filibuster rule to restrain them, they will spend, tax, and regulate a quadrillion dollars worth of programs that will destroy the economy. On the other hand, if Mr. Trump exercises his executive authority to impound non-essentials, he will greatly slim down the size and scope of the federal government, while reducing deficits and debt along the way. In that scenario, economic prosperity will flourish almost more than anybody can possibly imagine. From Mr. Kudlow’s broadcast on Fox Business Network.",2025-10-31 21:15:44,The New York Sun
"PA premier says Ramallah best placed to lead postwar Gaza, despite Israeli obstacles","Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa made the case on Thursday for Ramallah to play a leading role in the postwar management of Gaza, arguing that it is best positioned to do so despite the obstacles put up by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. “The Palestinian Authority is important, not only for keep[ing] the West Bank stable, but also for restoring the situation in Gaza,” Mustafa said during a virtual event with the Washington-based Brookings Institution think tank. “Despite all the challenges, despite all the difficulties, despite the issues that need reform — which we are working on — the only party that can get things back on track with support from international partners is the Palestinian Authority.” While much of the international community backs the PA replacing Hamas as the governing body in Gaza, Israel has maintained an effective veto over the transition, claiming that the Ramallah-based body is irredeemably corrupt and encourages violence against Israel. US President Donald Trump’s administration has sometimes been similarly critical of the PA, and even barred PA President Mahmoud Abbas from entering the US for the UN General Assembly last month. But as key Arab stakeholders have conditioned their support in the post-war management of Gaza on a role for a reformed PA, Washington appears to be slightly adapting its approach, allowing Abbas to participate in a conference of world leaders earlier this month in Egypt, where Trump was seen warmly embracing the PA leader. A longtime economic adviser to Abbas who previously served as deputy prime minister and economy minister, in addition to heading the Palestine Investment Fund and holding senior positions at the World Bank, Mustafa was appointed prime minister last year amid mounting calls for reform of the PA, which hasn’t held parliamentary elections since 2006 and presidential elections since 2005. He used the relatively rare appearance before an American audience to lay out the challenges the PA faces and the reforms that he has been implementing. Mustafa began by highlighting the over 1,000 checkpoints that the IDF has sprung up throughout the West Bank that have significantly curbed Palestinian movement, hampering the West Bank economy as a result. Israel says the measures are needed to maintain the security of settlers living in the territory amid efforts by Palestinian terror groups to target civilians and soldiers. The PA premier went on to highlight the over $3 billion in funds that the Israeli government has been withholding from the PA, which “has been making our economic life extremely difficult.” Due to the PA’s sub-state status, the Oslo Accords stipulate that Israel collect clearance revenues on the authority’s behalf and transfer those funds on a monthly basis to Ramallah. The PA is heavily reliant on the funds, which make up a majority of its annual budget. Israel has repeatedly withheld such funds, citing the PA’s welfare payments to convicted terrorists and their families, as well as the relatives of dead attackers, with Jerusalem saying the practice directly rewards terror. Abbas signed a decree in February ending the policy of payments to prisoners based on the length of their sentence. While documents obtained by The Times of Israel indicate that the old system has indeed been scrapped, Israel claims it remains in place, but has yet to offer proof on the matter. The lack of funds has meant public sector employees have missed out on 13 months of salary payments over the last three years alone, Mustafa said. Public school teachers have gone on strike due to partially paid salaries, thus causing a delay to the start of the school year. Meanwhile, new Israeli banking policies have also prevented the PA from depositing roughly $4.6 billion, creating a severe liquidity crisis that has compounded the already-dire economic situation. Unemployment in the West Bank has climbed to 35 percent, with more than 200,000 Palestinians losing their jobs inside Israel when the IDF revoked their entry permits due to security concerns following the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023. Mustafa said that Ramallah has managed to convince Arab and European countries to provide additional assistance to offset the lack of funds, but the PA is still piling up a massive deficit due to borrowing from the private sector. The PA premier then highlighted the IDF’s counter-terror operations throughout the West Bank that have forced tens of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in the midst of the economic crisis. Israel says such operations are a security necessity to combat entrenched terror networks and prevent numerous plots for deadly attacks every year. Those raids have taken place amid near-daily attacks by settlers on Palestinians that have gone largely unchecked. The Biden administration led Western countries in sanctioning extremist settler individuals and entities last year. But Trump had undone the policy, and Mustafa acknowledged that the sanctions had little effect on the ground. Nonetheless, he urged countries to take “more serious actions to give the right signal… to this Israeli government that this is not acceptable.” Asked about the reforms that he and the PA are undertaking, Mustafa acknowledged that Ramallah still has work to do, but he pointed to elections that Abbas has agreed to hold next year. Municipal elections will also be held in early 2026, the prime minister said. Abbas has announced plans for elections on multiple occasions in the past, but has repeatedly canceled them. He has blamed Israeli restrictions, but critics have pointed to fears that he and his widely unpopular Fatah party would suffer crushing defeats in any public vote. “Even if we are not the best performing administration in the world, we still have a responsibility toward our people, especially our people in Gaza,” Mustafa said. “What they need most today is assistance so that we can shelter them, send their kids back to schools, treat the injured people, start getting them new jobs… [and] rebuild Gaza.” He also noted that while many world leaders have called on the PA to reform, the term has become something of a buzzword that often goes unspecified. “While we are making every effort to [carry out] these reforms, we hope that this will not be used as an excuse for the Israeli government to continue its occupation,” Mustafa said. As for the PA’s ability to resume running Gaza after it was ousted by Hamas in 2007, Mustafa pointed out that Ramallah already has 35,000 employees in the Strip, including 6,000 teachers, 7,000 doctors and thousands of dormant security personnel, which could serve as the backbone for a police force necessary for stabilizing Gaza. Several thousand other PA employees are also being trained by Jordan and Egypt in order to be later deployed in Gaza, he said, adding that PA personnel have also been tasked with helping resume the management of the Rafah Border Crossing, once Israel agrees to reopen it. Mustafa said the PA is prepared to formally invite an international security force to help stabilize the Strip, as envisioned by Trump’s 20-point plan for ending the war. However, he stressed that the security force be mandated by the UN Security Council, work with and support existing PA forces, and also be a temporary solution. “I encourage everybody to help get the PA in the right place… not only to govern in the West Bank, but also in Gaza because this is the best way possible to get us out of the situation in [the Strip],” Mustafa continued. “No international mission alone can do it. The PA is a big asset for stability in the region.” Asked in closing how he views the recent decisions by several major Western countries to recognize a Palestinian state, Mustafa insisted that those moves were not merely symbolic. “I think this will help us restore hope that a two-state solution is still possible [by demonstrating that] there is still a strong international support for it,” he said. “It’s important to remind the Israeli government and the Israeli people that occupation is not the solution. There are still millions of Palestinians living next door, and they still demand their rights, regardless of time passing.” Support The Times of Israel's independent journalism and receive access to our documentary series, DocuNation: The Heart of Israel.

Ahiagbah Demands Urgent Action on Stalled Feed Ghana Agenda,"Political figure Richard Ahiagbah has demanded immediate government action to revive Ghana’s stalled agricultural agenda. He contends that critical delays in the Feed Ghana program are depriving farmers and the national economy of promised benefits. Ahiagbah argued the initiative, designed to enhance food security and provide farmer support, has failed to show meaningful progress. He expressed particular concern over the absence of promised buffer stock systems and market access for local producers. These shortcomings especially impact local rice farmers grappling with post harvest losses, he noted. The situation reportedly undermines confidence in the administration’s flagship strategy and hinders the sector’s potential for job creation and expanded production. Ahiagbah challenged the government to reaffirm its commitment to import substitution. He specifically urged authorities to bolster domestic capacity for rice production. “It would be a feather in the president’s cap to promote our local capacity,” Ahiagbah stated, advocating for political will to support Ghanaian growers over import cartels. He further emphasized that locally produced rice offers superior nutritional value compared to imported alternatives. Consistent execution of agricultural reforms, he maintained, would conserve foreign exchange, stabilize the cedi, generate employment, and ensure sustainable sector growth.",2025-10-31 21:13:49,News Ghana

The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow boasted weekly gains and their longest monthly winning streaks in years. Amazon shares rallied sharply, closing up 9.6 per cent after hitting an all-time high following its forecast for quarterly sales above estimates. The online retailer and cloud services giant helped the consumer discretionary sector close up 4 per cent for its biggest one-day gain since May 12. But elsewhere in megacap companies, Apple’s shares closed down 0.4 per cent after its forecast for iPhone holiday quarter sales surpassed Wall Street expectations was clouded by chief executive officer Tim Cook’s flagging of supply constraints. And in remarks that cooled investor hopes for policy easing, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president Raphael Bostic said on Oct 31 that a December rate cut was not locked in despite market expectations for a cut. And Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Beth Hammack said she had opposed a rate cut on Oct 29 because inflation is too high. On Oct 31, traders were pricing in a 65 per cent probability of a December rate cut, down from 72.8 per cent on Oct 30 and 91.7 per cent a week ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. “The theme today is pretty similar to what we saw yesterday. It’s earnings coming in a little better than expected but tempered by a little more hawkish commentary from the Fed,” said Mr James Ragan, co-CIO and director of investment management research at D.A. Davidson. Mr Jake Seltz, portfolio manager for the Empiric LT Equity team at Allspring, said investors “may have gotten in front of their skis” in their bets for lower rates. Some grocery stocks traded lower on Oct 31 on worries about a dip in November sales if federal food aid benefits, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or Snap, lapse in the ongoing government shutdown. Two federal judges ruled on Oct 31 that President Donald Trump’s administration cannot suspend food aid for millions of Americans during the shutdown, saying the government must use contingency funds to pay for the benefits. But shares of grocer Kroger ended down 2.8 per cent while food supplier Conagra Brands lost 1.3 per cent and Walmart ended down 1 per cent even after the rulings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 40.75 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 47,562.87, the S&P 500 gained 17.86 points, or 0.26 per cent, to 6,840.20 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 143.81 points, or 0.61 per cent, to 23,724.96. For the month, the S&P 500 added 2.27 per cent, for a sixth consecutive monthly gain, which was its longest such streak since August 2021. The Nasdaq Composite added 4.7 per cent for October, capping a seven-month winning streak, its longest since early 2018. The Dow rose 2.5 per cent for the month, for its sixth straight monthly gain and its longest monthly advance since January 2018. For the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent while the Nasdaq added 2.24 per cent and the Dow climbed 0.75 per cent. Of the 315 S&P 500 companies that have reported third-quarter results so far, 83.2 per cent have surpassed analysts’ estimates, according to LSEG data. That is well above the historical average, where roughly 67 per cent of firms beat forecasts. With a lack of economic data from the government due to the month-long shutdown, Ms Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital, said investors were keenly focused on earnings reports. “The government isn’t giving us the data that we have become dependent on, so we’re using companies as we should by the way for guidance about how the economy is going,” she said. In other moves, Warner Bros Discovery jumped 8.7 per cent following a Reuters report that Netflix was actively exploring a bid for the company’s studio and streaming business. Netflix rose 2.7 per cent after it unveiled plans for a 10-for-1 stock split. Western Digital closed up 8.7 per cent after rallying to an all-time high following its forecast of quarterly earnings above Wall Street estimates. Shares of Solar panel maker First Solar surged 14.3 per cent after surpassing expectations for third-quarter sales. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.28-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, where there were 159 new highs and 131 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 2,773 stocks rose and 1,958 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.42-to-1 ratio.

West Africa Takes Digital Leap With SIGMAT Customs Launch,"The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is officially launching a homegrown digital customs platform that could fundamentally transform how goods move across the region’s borders, as technical experts from Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Liberia convene in Monrovia this week to finalize preparations for rolling out the Interconnected System for the Management of Goods in Transit. The two day meeting, taking place October 30 through 31 in the Liberian capital, brings together senior customs officials and ICT specialists to review operational guidelines and technical protocols before Friday’s official launch ceremony. SIGMAT, as the platform is known, represents years of planning to create a real time digital network enabling customs authorities across ECOWAS member states to exchange transit data electronically, track cargo movements, and process clearances with minimal paperwork. The system is designed to make cross border trade faster, safer, and more transparent, with officials saying the platform will help tackle smuggling and documentation fraud while ensuring more efficient coordination among customs agencies along regional trade corridors. For a region where trucks can sit at borders for days awaiting clearance while goods spoil and costs mount, the potential impact looks substantial. What makes SIGMAT particularly significant is its homegrown nature. Rather than importing expensive foreign solutions that might not fit West African realities, ECOWAS developed this platform specifically for the region’s needs and challenges. As of May 2025, nine ECOWAS member states had already installed SIGMAT in their customs IT systems, with only Guinea Bissau and Cabo Verde yet to implement, demonstrating momentum building toward broader regional adoption. The initial rollout among Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Liberia creates a strategic corridor linking coastal and landlocked nations, addressing one of West Africa’s most persistent trade challenges. Landlocked countries like Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger depend entirely on coastal neighbors for access to international markets, making efficient transit systems crucial for their economic survival. When transit goods get stuck at borders or disappear through diversion, these landlocked nations suffer disproportionately. Friday’s launch ceremony will be attended by the Heads of Customs Administrations from the three participating countries, representatives of the ECOWAS Commission, and key development partners including the German International Cooperation Agency, which has supported SIGMAT’s development. This multi stakeholder approach reflects recognition that transforming regional trade requires coordination across governments, technical agencies, and international supporters. The platform operates as a centralized digital hub connecting customs administrations across member states. Importers, exporters, and customs agents submit declarations electronically through the SIGMAT portal, which then standardizes documentation across ECOWAS countries, reducing discrepancies and ensuring compliance with regional trade agreements. The system allows customs officials in different countries to access shared data instantly, eliminating redundant paperwork that has historically slowed border crossings. For goods in transit, SIGMAT provides end to end visibility by issuing electronic transit documents tracked in real time as cargo moves across borders. This ensures duties and taxes are properly managed while reducing risks of smuggling and revenue leakage that have plagued West African trade corridors for decades. A shipment moving from Abidjan to Monrovia, for instance, would be monitored digitally with automated alerts for any deviations from approved routes. The system’s benefits extend beyond just faster processing. By reducing clearance times by up to 40% and minimizing physical inspections, SIGMAT can lower costs for businesses through reduced demurrage and storage charges that have long plagued ports due to delays. For traders operating on thin margins, these savings could mean the difference between profit and loss on shipments. Revenue protection represents another crucial advantage. West African governments lose millions annually to customs fraud, cargo diversion, and underdeclaration of goods values. When paper based systems dominate and different countries can’t communicate electronically, tracking goods becomes nearly impossible once they leave the first border. SIGMAT’s real time monitoring makes it far harder for unscrupulous traders to game the system. The platform builds on earlier pilot programs that demonstrated viability. Nigeria and Benin Republic launched SIGMAT connectivity in May 2025 at the Seme Krake border, a critical junction on the Abidjan Lagos corridor that handles massive trade volumes. That pilot showed the technical feasibility of connecting different national customs systems and highlighted both successes and challenges that informed subsequent rollouts. Nigeria’s Comptroller General of Customs noted at that May launch that the concept was conceived over a decade ago, designed to improve goods visibility in transit, combat diversion and fraud along trade corridors, foster inter agency coordination, and reduce trade delays. The long development timeline reflects both the technical complexity and the political will required to align different national interests around common regional standards. Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, and Niger successfully implemented SIGMAT interconnections earlier, providing proof of concept that the system works when properly deployed. Those landlocked Sahelian nations have particular incentive to make transit systems efficient given their complete dependence on coastal access. Their experiences offer valuable lessons for this week’s Monrovia launch. However, SIGMAT faces real implementation challenges. Many West African countries struggle with unreliable electricity, poor digital infrastructure, and inconsistent internet access. A digital customs platform only works as well as the underlying connectivity supporting it. If power fails or internet drops at critical border points, the entire system risks grinding to halt, potentially creating worse bottlenecks than the paper systems it replaces. Political will represents another variable. Customs policies vary significantly across ECOWAS member states, reflecting different national interests, economic priorities, and revenue needs. Some countries depend heavily on customs revenue and may resist transparency that could reduce collections in the short term, even if regional integration benefits everyone long term. Getting fifteen countries to implement common standards and maintain consistent enforcement requires sustained political commitment. There’s also the human factor. The most sophisticated digital system proves useless if border agents, customs officers, and traders don’t understand, trust, or use it properly. Training programs must reach thousands of personnel across multiple countries, explaining not just how SIGMAT works technically but why it serves everyone’s interests. Resistance from officials comfortable with existing systems, or who benefit from current inefficiencies, could quietly undermine implementation. For Liberia specifically, hosting this launch carries symbolic importance. The country has worked hard rebuilding its institutions and economy following years of civil conflict, and serving as the venue for significant regional initiatives demonstrates its reintegration into West African leadership. Successfully implementing SIGMAT could help Liberia strengthen its position as a reliable trade partner and transit hub. The timing also matters for regional integration efforts more broadly. ECOWAS continues pursuing its vision for an integrated West African economy with free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. Plans for a common currency, the ECO, target 2027 launch despite delays and challenges. SIGMAT represents tangible progress on integration that affects real traders and real goods today, building confidence that broader regional projects can succeed. Trade facilitation through digital systems aligns with global trends as well. Countries worldwide are digitizing customs operations through platforms like UNCTAD’s ASYCUDA system, which twelve ECOWAS members already use as their national customs software. SIGMAT’s ability to integrate with ASYCUDA creates technical foundations for sustainable expansion as more countries join. The broader economic implications could prove substantial. Faster, cheaper, more reliable cross border trade enables businesses to plan better, invest more confidently, and access larger markets. Small and medium enterprises particularly benefit when trade barriers fall, since they lack the resources that larger firms use to navigate complex customs procedures. If SIGMAT delivers promised improvements, it could unleash entrepreneurial energy across the region. For development partners supporting SIGMAT, the platform represents exactly the kind of regional public good worth investing in. Unlike projects benefiting single countries, SIGMAT creates network effects where value increases as more members join. German cooperation through GIZ reflects European interest in stable, prosperous West Africa as migration pressures and security concerns make regional development a strategic priority. Friday’s launch won’t solve all West African trade challenges instantly. Corruption, poor infrastructure, inconsistent regulations, and weak institutions will continue constraining commerce regardless of how well SIGMAT functions technically. But the platform addresses genuine problems in ways that create measurable improvements for stakeholders across the trade ecosystem. As customs chiefs and technical experts finalize preparations this week, they’re working on something that transcends routine government technology projects. SIGMAT embodies a vision where West African borders become connectors rather than barriers, where goods flow efficiently supporting economic growth, and where regional integration moves from aspiration toward reality one digital connection at a time. Whether SIGMAT fulfills its promise depends on sustained commitment across multiple countries over years of implementation. The Monrovia launch represents an important milestone, but true success will be measured by how many trucks cross borders faster, how much revenue governments collect more efficiently, and how many businesses thrive thanks to reduced trade friction across this dynamic but fragmented region.",2025-10-31 21:25:55,News Ghana
We were never meant to be anonymous,"I was born in Bangkok, Thailand — a metropolis of over 11 million people — and studied in Boston and Chicago. Today, I call Harmony, Minnesota home — a town along the Root River with a population boasting just over 1,000 people. Despite my affection for small town living, I still think of my urban upbringing fondly, and still salivate thinking of my favorite ramen restaurant in Chicago. Yet, in the midst of so many options of where to eat, who to befriend, where to spend my time, I also know that most of my city experiences included sitting in a crowded train, head down, with my face buried in my phone and clueless to the people around me. I was often more of a consumer of community, rather than a creator. I could go through a whole day and be completely anonymous. And while periods of anonymity can help you explore new parts of yourself, ultimately I don’t believe humans are meant to live anonymous lives. In an age of digital connection and hyper mobility, it’s easy to forget the quiet power of being known. Not just recognized, but truly known — by name, by story, by contribution. The poet Wendell Berry once wrote, “A community is the mental and spiritual condition of knowing that the place is shared, and that the people who share the place define and limit the possibilities of each other's lives.” That’s not just poetic — it’s a blueprint for vitality. Here in southern Minnesota, we see this truth play out every day. Our small towns are not just dots on a map; they are ecosystems of relationship. The barista who remembers your order, the neighbor who plows your driveway without asking, the school board member who provides in-home child care to your new infant — these are not coincidences. They are the fabric of a life that resists anonymity. At Southern Minnesota Initiative Foundation, we invest in this fabric. We believe that economic development is inseparable from human development. That thriving communities are built not just on infrastructure, but on trust. And that the vitality of a place depends on the visibility of its people. Just this month, we approved 23 Small Town Grants totaling $200,000 to support projects focused on creating a sense of belonging for all and are in the process of approving Taylor Rural Improvements Grant applications that can make a big impact on the vibrancy of small towns. When I tell you about why I love Harmony, it’s not just that we have four restaurants, a distillery and a grocery store all along our downtown drag — but that I can tell you about the chef who comes out of the kitchen to sing Pink Pony Club with his five-year-old daughter at open mic night, or the couple who moved from New Mexico to open a maker space for the community because they fell in love with a run-down building that they believed they could bring back to life. Our community knows their stories, and they show up to wrap their support around them. To us, it’s not just the end product but the process and people it takes to get there. Similarly, when SMIF supports early childhood programs, we’re not just preparing kids for school — we’re anchoring families in a shared future. When we fund local entrepreneurs, we’re not just boosting the economy — we’re affirming that dreams belong here. And when we partner with towns to support community initiatives, we’re not just contributing resources — we’re contributing to a sense of belonging. Berry’s words remind us that community is not a luxury — it’s a necessity. Humans were never meant to live anonymous lives. We are meant to be accountable, celebrated, challenged and cherished. That’s what small towns offer, both to long-time residents and the newcomers from across the state, country or from across the world, who help our small towns remain vital. And that’s why we must continue to invest in them — not just with dollars, but with belief. Before my predecessor retired, he launched the Tim Penny Small Towns endowment fund to establish a long-term investment vehicle dedicated to that very belief. Today, I get the honor of continuing to grow our Small Town Fund and invite those of you reading to join me. Because in the end, vitality isn’t measured by population size. It’s measured by the strength of connection. And in southern Minnesota, connection is our greatest resource. As always, I welcome your comments and questions.

'Why did he promise it?': Poilievre criticizes Carney for not securing U.S. trade deal,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is questioning why Prime Minister Mark Carney promised he could handle U.S. President Donald Trump, given that the two countries have yet to finalize a trade agreement that would see Canada granted some tariff relief. Speaking to CBC’s Rosemary Barton Live, Poilievre said Carney has not delivered on what he promised during the spring election campaign. “Mr. Carney promised a good deal by July 21. He promised he could negotiate a win with President Trump. Those were his promises,” he told host Rosemary Barton. “Some might say, ‘Look, it’s unrealistic to expect to get that from President Trump.’ So why did he promise it? It wasn't just that it was a promise. It was the promise.” Carney’s key message during the spring election campaign was centred around dealing with the U.S. administration. Negotiators were working toward a potential deal on tariffs until Trump abruptly called off trade talks in a late-night social media post last week. The president said his decision was due to an advertisement by the Ontario government that uses former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's own words to send an anti-tariff message to American audiences. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said Carney apologized for the ad, which was pulled off the air on Monday — but not before it was played over the weekend, including on American networks during the World Series. “I have a very good relationship [with Carney]. I like him a lot, but what they did was wrong. He was very nice. He apologized for what they did with the commercial,” Trump said on Friday in a scrum with reporters on Air Force One. The Prime Minister's Office has not confirmed whether Carney personally apologized for the ad. Trump also said he has no plans to resume trade talks with Canada. When asked how he would handle the relationship with Trump, Poilievre argued boosting the economy would put Canada in a position of strength and rang off some of his promises to get major projects built. But he suggested that speculating if his approach would work better than Carney’s isn’t helpful at the moment because he isn’t prime minister. “What we do know is that Mr. Carney is prime minister — has been for seven months — and these are the results that he's got,” he said. “His failures abroad are costing us at home.” The full interview with Poilievre will air on Rosemary Barton Live, Sunday at 10 a.m. ET.",2025-10-31 21:23:38,Yahoo!

Cuomo courts Sliwa voters in Russian NYC neighborhood — warning against danger of socialist Zohran Mamdani,"Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo made an appeal to Republican voters in Brooklyn’s Russian-speaking enclave Friday — warning them a vote for GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa will only help socialist Zohran Mamdani get elected. The independent mayoral candidate positioned himself as the only viable option to beat the front-runner Democratic nominee, campaigning alongside firebrand Republican Councilwoman Inna Vernikov in Brighton Beach. “There is no way Curtis Sliwa can actually win. Curtis Sliwa can only make Zohran Mamdani win,” Cuomo said, recalling President Trump’s brutal prognosis of the Guardian Angels founder’s chances in the Nov. 4 election. “Don’t believe me. Believe President Trump if you’re a Republican” Cuomo told voters at the Ocean View Cafe, a Ukrainian restaurant on Brighton Beach Avenue. “President Trump said Curtis Sliwa is not ready for prime time.” Vernikov, a staunch Republican who nonetheless endorsed Cuomo over her party’s nominee this week, recalled the local community is largely made up of “families who escaped the former Soviet Union.” “They escaped communism and socialism. A lot of people here are Jewish immigrants. They escaped antisemitism,” she said. “We came to America for the American dream, for capitalism, for the free market economy, for opportunities for our children. “And what we’re seeing now is everything that we escaped, communism, socialism, antisemitism is coming back into New York City.” The local councilwoman, for the 48th District, previously supported Sliwa for mayor — but changed her tune to back Cuomo after seeing polling results showing the veteran Democrat had a better chance of beating socialist Mamdani. “Curtis Sliwa cannot be mayor because he is not winning … the only one who can beat Mamdani is Governor Andrew Cuomo,” she said, referring to recent polls that show Cuomo between 10 to 25 points behind Mamdani and Sliwa lagging by 25 to 29 points. The councilwoman — who was arrested in 2023 for wielding a firearm at a pro-Palestinian rally — referred to Mamdani as a “communist and an antisemitic” to her constituents. Mamdani, who identifies as a democratic socialist, last week held a press conference slamming the rhetoric spewed by his opponents as Islamophobic — which Cuomo and Sliwa have denied. Daniel Kurzyna, a spokesperson for Sliwa, said the concerted effort from Vernikov and Cuomo to siphon the GOP standard-bearer’s voters was “not needle-moving whatsoever.” “Curtis will shock the world,” he said. A rep for Mamdani did not respond to the Post’s request for comment.",2025-10-31 21:23:27,New York Post

Investing in affordable rental homes in North Vancouver,"NORTH VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 31, 2025 /CNW/ - Solving Canada's housing crisis requires immediate action to build up supply and bring down costs. The Government of Canada is stepping up with unprecedented investments to supercharge housing construction in Canada. To that end, the federal government launched Build Canada Homes, a new federal agency that will build affordable housing at scale, including transitional and supportive housing, deeply affordable and community housing, and affordable homes for the Canadian middle class. As we build a strong Canadian housing sector, purposeful collaboration will be essential. That means working together with the private and non-profit sectors to bring down costs and build homes at a scale and pace not seen in generations. These investments are also providing Canadians with increased access to affordable and sustainable housing. The Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) provides funding through low-interest and/or forgivable loans or contributions to partnered organizations for new affordable housing and the renovation and repair of existing, affordable and community housing. Today, the Honourable Gregor Robertson, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure and Minister responsible for Pacific Economic Development Canada was joined by the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Member of Parliament for North Vancouver – Capilano, and Linda Buchanan, Mayor of the City of North Vancouver toured the first phase of an ambitious affordable housing project at 144 St Georges Avenue, which is nearing completion and which received support from the federal government. The second phase of this project is receiving $84.5 million in funding to help build 179 secure, affordable rental homes at 120 St Georges Avenue. They also This is an example of the Government of Canada's commitment to investing in affordable housing right across the country The 18-storey, mass timber building will provide housing for singles, couples, families, and seniors in North Vancouver. The rental homes will range in size from studio to three-bedroom units. This is the second phase of the North Shore Neighbourhood House Hub Redevelopment, which is a multi-partner project on City-owned land that supports the City's ongoing commitment to increasing rental housing and community-based services. When all three phases are completed, it will provide rental housing, a new North Shore Neighbourhood House (NSNH), a respite centre with 18 overnight beds and 25 adult daycare spaces, and a redesigned Derek Inman Park. Budget 2025, to be tabled next week, will build on this momentum with further measures to lower costs for builders, catalyse private capital, and work towards doubling the pace of homebuilding across Canada. Budget 2025 will spend less on government operations and reduce waste, so we can invest more to grow our economy, build more homes, and make life more affordable for you. Quotes: ""We need to build more, build better and build bolder. Through investments in rental housing, our government is supporting those who need it most, here in North Vancouver and across the country. We are committed to strengthening communities through initiatives like this one."" — The Honourable Gregor Robertson, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure and Minister responsible for Pacific Economic Development Canada ""The Government of Canada is committed to increasing housing supply to enable enhanced affordability. I have been watching progress on what will be an 18-storey mass timber building – the new home to our beloved community services provider, the North Shore Neighbourhood House. Its 179 rental homes, from studios to three-bedroom units, will be a step forward for housing in North Vancouver – which is a real issue for many who live here. . It's an example of what's possible when all levels of government and the private sector work together. It's also another step forward in our ambitious plan to build Canada strong."" — The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Member of Parliament for North Vancouver—Capilano ""The development at 120 St. Georges Avenue is a great example of how BC Builds is transforming housing delivery in our province.

On the continued US federal shutdown, Trump redoubled his criticism of congressional Democrats, whom he accused of incompetence. While statements from Fed officials were also being monitored, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said he opposed this week’s interest rate cut due to concerns over inflation. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, who does not have voting rights on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) this year, also noted that the labor market was only cooling slowly and that inflation remains too high, arguing that the current economic outlook did not warrant a rate cut. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack also noted that she did not participate in this week's rate cut decision, stating that the Fed should maintain some restrictions to bring down inflation. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, however, supported the cut, saying that even after rates were lowered, US monetary policy still remained in restrictive.",2025-10-31 21:44:03,Anadolu Agency
"COP 30: Tinubu Okays National Carbon Market Framework, Climate Fund","Ahead of the 30th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 30) in Brazil, President Bola Tinubu has approved the adoption of a National Carbon Market Framework, the operationalisation of the Climate Change Fund and the restoration of the National Council on Climate Change (NCCC) to the budget line. The goal was to establish and manage Nigeria’s participation in carbon markets, enabling the nation to unlock between $2.5billion and $3billion annually in carbon finance over the next decade to help meet climate goals. The approvals followed a presentation by the Director General of NCCC, Mrs Omotenioye Majekodunmi, at the second meeting of the Council held on Thursday evening at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. President Tinubu, who was represented by Vice President Kashim Shettima, said the approvals were part of measures by his administration to properly position Nigeria to leverage opportunities in the global carbon market and be more active in climate change ecosystem. According to a statement by presidential spokesman, Stanley Nkwocha, the Nigerian leader also set the agenda for Nigeria ahead of the forthcoming COP 30 scheduled for Belem, Brazil, saying the focus was to harness all of the opportunities for financing climate resilient projects and related interventions, particularly from the global carbon market. The President said his administration recognised the fact that addressing climate change was not just an environment imperative but an opportunity to unlock new investments, jobs and innovations across the nation’s energy, agriculture and industrial sectors. He said, “Nigeria stands ready to takes its rightful place as a global leader in climate action, ensuring that our voice and our reality are heard and respected in international negotiations. “We have demonstrated this commitment through our active participation in the UNFCCC process, our progress towards implementing our nationally determined contributions and our efforts to mobilize climate finance for adaption and mitigation across all levels of government.” The President assured that as chairman of the Council, climate action will continue to be prioritised in his administration’s development agenda. “We will continue to champion policies that protect our people, strengthen our economy and position Nigeria as a destination for green investment and innovation,” he added. Earlier, the Director-General of the National Council on Climate Change and Secretary to the Council, Mrs. Omotenioye Majekodunmi, informed the council chaired by Vice President Shettima, who represented President Tinubu, that the meeting was timely ahead of the 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 30) scheduled to hold in Brazil. She said the deliberations and decisions of the council would shape how Nigeria is perceived globally and determine how effectively the country can mobilize support to achieve its climate goals. The Council Secretariat expressed its commitment to providing the technical leadership and coordination needed to translate Nigeria’s climate goals into measurable results. Presenting the Council’s progress report, Majekodunmi disclosed that Nigeria is now eligible to access new rounds of climate finance from multilateral funds. Highlighting the Secretariat’s key requests, she said the Council sought the adoption of the National Carbon Market Framework to enable Nigeria unlock between $2.5 billion and $3 billion annually in carbon finance over the next decade. The Council also requested the operationaliszation of the Climate Change Fund to ensure immediate readiness for fund mobilisation and utilisation. The final request was for the Council to restore the NCCC budget line within the annual FAAC allocation to guarantee the financial stability of the Climate Change Fund. The Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, backed the Council Secretariat’s recommendations, noting that Nigeria must secure a strong position within the carbon framework. He assured the Council of the Finance Ministry’s support, including coordination with the ministry’s economic department to host a quarterly Climate Finance Tracking Dashboard.",2025-10-31 21:41:04,Leadership
Top Democrat presses Trump administration on Argentina 'bailout' during shutdown,"Rep. Jamie Raskin demands transparency from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the Trump administration's $40 billion Argentina deal. FIRST ON FOX: The top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee is demanding increased transparency from the Trump administration on the factors that led it to make its multibillion-dollar gamble on Argentina. In a letter sent Friday to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Robert Citrone, the manager of Discovery Capital Management LLC, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., requested details about their relationship after the Trump administration's announcement of the deal earlier this month. Raskin, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, asked to see any correspondence between Bessent and Citrone on Argentina, the investment and Citrone’s holdings in the country. ""It is imperative that the American people have a full understanding of why, in the midst of a government shutdown, this administration has chosen to orchestrate a $40 billion bailout to Argentina. What specific arrangements were made to accomplish this astounding result?"" Raskin wrote. TRUMP, DEMOCRATS LOCKED IN ENDLESS CYCLES OF PAYBACK AFTER COMEY INDICTMENT AND TARGETING PRESIDENT'S ENEMIES Citrone did not respond to several requests for comment. Russell Dye, a spokesperson for the Republican Judiciary Committee, said the letter represented just the most recent example of Democrats' fixation on critiquing the administration’s decisions. ""Democrats should focus on opening the government and paying federal workers, many of whom live in ranking member Raskin’s district, rather than obsessing over President Trump. But, sadly, their priority will always be attacking President Trump instead of paying the troops, air traffic controllers and families who are hurting,"" Dye said. FOX NEWS POLITICS NEWSLETTER: CORNYN'S 'CROOKED POLITICIANS' CRACKDOWN The Trump administration announced that it facilitated $20 billion in private financing for Argentina alongside a $20 billion currency swap, providing a financial backstop for a country that has struggled for years to find its footing amid high inflation. The investment aims to help Argentina manage its debts as the value of its currency, the Argentine peso, continues to fluctuate. The decision to direct American dollars toward Argentina raised accusations from Democrats that the investment carried political undertones meant to benefit Argentine President Javier Milei, a figure closely aligned with the Trump administration. Like Trump, Milei entered office in 2023 with promises to shrink the government’s footprint and bring down the country’s costs. But more than just the political undercurrents, Democrats like Raskin argue that some figures close to the administration — like Citrone — may receive collateral benefits as a result. ""In October 2024, you said that ‘the probability of default in Argentina is minuscule.’ Yet, in the past couple of months, a run on the Argentinian peso has put the country’s economy — and your hedge fund’s massive investments — on the brink of collapse. Suddenly, President Trump and Secretary Bessent announced the United States would take ‘exceptional measures’ to stabilize Argentina’s markets. The total amount of assistance for Argentina is a whopping $40 billion,"" Raskin wrote. Citrone and Bessent previously worked together for George Soros in 2013, according to statements Citrone made in a Goldman Sachs podcast. According to the reporting from the Securities and Exchange Commission , Discovery Capital’s exposure to Argentina is high, but not as high as it used to be. Discovery’s investments with companies based in or conducting business in Argentina have scaled down since December 2024. The fund’s investments in 2025 are tens of millions of dollars below levels from a year before. Citrone’s exposure in connection with Argentina is still north of $100 million, according to the SEC. RUBIO BLASTS 'DISHONEST' DEMOCRATS FOR TYING HIM TO 'FAKE' TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS In addition to demanding more information about Bessent's thinking on Argentina, Raskin blasted the decision to invest in Argentina during an ongoing, 31-day government shutdown. ""The Republican government shutdown has deprived millions of federal workers — including law enforcement and air traffic controllers — of their paychecks and is threatening government programs vital to the American people. But, in the midst of this government-created crisis, the Trump administration has chosen to arrange a $40 billion bailout to Argentina — half of it funded with taxpayer money,"" Raskin wrote.

"The British government ‘must recognise hydrogen’, says Hyundai","Q: There’s a well-worn joke in motoring circles that hydrogen fuel-cell cars are ten years from becoming mainstream … and have been since the 1960s. That’s when General Motors introduced its first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle concept. But as Hyundai launches a new and improved version of its hydrogen car, the company’s UK president is urging the British government to recognise the technology as a key part of a “global hydrogen economy”. Not doing so could risk the UK being left behind. According to data from H2stations.org, at the end of 2024 there were 748 hydrogen refuelling stations in operation across Asia — China being the global leader with 384 locations across the country. Hyundai’s native South Korea is second, with 198 stations, and almost every service area along its motorway network now includes hydrogen refuelling. Europe is also investing in its hydrogen refuelling network, with 294 locations in operation across the Continent by the end of last year. Of these, 113 were in Germany, with 65 in France, 25 in the Netherlands and 19 in Switzerland. But the UK passenger car refuelling network is lagging behind, and the number of places to top up a hydrogen tank has gone into reverse in recent years. In 2019 there were ten publicly accessible H₂ filling stations in the UK, but today the figure stands at two: one at Heathrow (Hatton Cross) and the other in Tyseley, Birmingham. Two hydrogen fuel cell cars are on sale in the UK: the Toyota Mirai and the Hyundai Nexo. Hyundai says it has sold 40,000 Nexo cars worldwide, with its domestic market having the most sales. However, it is believed fewer than 20 have been registered in the UK since it was put on sale here in 2019, with most used as demonstration vehicles by companies with an interest in developing the hydrogen economy. The focus in the UK is shifting towards the operation of buses and commercial vehicles that support the demand for the growth of hydrogen, with existing and planned hydrogen hubs for these vehicles scattered around the country, including in Aberdeen, Dundee, the Tees Valley, Merseyside, Suffolk and south Wales. This follows more than £2 billion in government funding for 11 projects, including Whitelee Green Hydrogen in Scotland, one of whose customers will be the InchDairnie distillery in Fife, which is aiming to distil its whisky sustainably by 2027. The initial Hydrogen Allocation Rounds funding has also gone towards the Bradford Low Carbon project, which will use renewable electricity to power a 24.5mW alkaline electrolyser to supply clean hydrogen to the likes of JCB, and Wrightbus, which developed the world’s first hydrogen-powered double-decker bus. Twenty-seven projects were selected earlier this year for the second round of funding, known as HAR2, which includes £400 million of private sector investment. These could use hydrogen to decarbonise their manufacturing and industrial processes, including ammonia production, new clean power generation, glass manufacturing, brick-making, and sustainable aviation fuel production. Hyundai is banking on this commercial hydrogen economy growth alongside that of passenger cars. “Hydrogen will become a key pillar of the global clean energy ecosystem — not only in mobility, but also in energy and industry,” said Ashley Andrew, the UK president of Hyundai and its sister brand Genesis. “Hyundai views hydrogen as essential to achieving carbon neutrality, especially in sectors that are hard to fully electrify, such as commercial transport, logistics and industrial applications. “We expect hydrogen to expand beyond passenger vehicles into commercial vehicles, trains, maritime and even future home and industrial energy systems.” This week, Hyundai broke ground on a new hydrogen fuel cell production facility in Ulsan, South Korea, following an investment of nearly £500 million. The 43,000 sq m facility, which is set for completion in 2027, will mass-produce 30,000 fuel cell units annually. It will also include advanced polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysers. These split hydrogen from oxygen in water molecules, and the gas can then be compressed and stored in tanks. It’s the recombining of hydrogen with oxygen from the air in a fuel cell that generates electrical energy, with water being the by-product. PEMs run on renewable energy, such as solar, and transportation in zero-emission vehicles results in a green power ecosystem. When created via fossil fuels the resulting gas is known as grey, brown or black hydrogen, as the process is not genuinely clean. The Ulsan ground-breaking ceremony also involved hydrogen-powered vehicles, including lorries, excavators, boats, tractors and forklifts. “Hydrogen accelerates carbon neutrality by addressing the intermittency of renewables and enhancing energy resilience,” said Jaehoon Chang, the vice-chairman of Hyundai Motor Group. “Hydrogen also stands out as a strategic energy carrier, enabling localised generation and distribution systems — such as off-grid and micro-grid ecosystems — which reduce reliance on centralised grids and strengthen communities’ self-sufficiency.” Hyundai’s investment in the technology includes advances in efficiency for the new Nexo, with the fuel cell output up 11 per cent, battery output up 100 per cent and the electric motor output up 33 per cent compared with the previous-generation Nexo. Combined with aerodynamic improvements, its range on a single charge of hydrogen has increased from 414 miles to 513 miles, and the Nexo now has a towing capacity of up to 1,000kg (the previous model was not rated for towing at all). It takes about five minutes to refuel completely. The company is developing its hydrogen passenger cars alongside its hybrids and battery electric vehicles (Bevs), such as the Ioniq 5, the Ioniq 6 and the Kona Electric. Hyundai Motor Group also sells Bevs under the Kia and Genesis brands. The firm expects the two technologies to continue to coexist. “Bevs may be more suitable for short-distance applications without the need for quick charging, while FCEVs, with their exceptional energy density and rapid-refuelling capabilities, will conquer long and medium-haul trucking,” Andrew said. “The hydrogen industry remains in a growth phase and will continue to advance through close collaboration between industry and government, as public-private partnerships are key to expanding infrastructure. “To meet zero-emission vehicle mandates and accelerate fleet decarbonisation, government must recognise hydrogen as a strategic enabler, and maintain openness to all viable technologies that support medium to long-term climate goals.” CAR CLINIC October 23 2025, 1.20pm Tim Shallcross October 16 2025, 6.00pm Adam Hay-Nicholls car clinic October 07 2025, 8.00pm Tim Shallcross October 31 2025, 11.00pm David Green November 01 2025, 4.00am Anna Murphy, Fashion Director October 31 2025, 11.00pm Anna Murphy",2025-10-31 21:45:37,The Times

Republican Matt Van Epps touts strong support of Trump in Tennessee special congressional election,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — Republican nominee for US Congress Matt Van Epps touted his military service and endorsement from President Donald Trump in his primary victory and believes those factors will help him beat his Democratic opponent in the special congressional election. Van Epps is a West Point graduate who flew helicopter combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. He beat out a crowded Republican field with nearly 52% of the total Republican vote. Van Epps faces Aftyn Behn, the democratic nominee, are going head to head in a special election to fill the congressional seat vacated after republican Mark Green abruptly retired over the summer. On Inside Politics, Van Epps said President Trump's popularity remains strong across the seventh congressional district, which includes 14 counties and many rural areas that are home to soybean farmers, who right now, are being hit hard by tariffs. ""Soybean farmers, row crop farmers are struggling,"" Van Epps acknowledged. But added that he supports the President's use of tariffs. ""The president, who is the best negotiator in the world, is working to ensure we stop getting ripped off and that we have fair trade and I think in the long-term we are going to see benefits from that,"" Van Epps said. He's such a strong supporter of President Trump, that he did not rule out him serving a third term, despite the the Constitution limiting US presidents to a total of two terms. He was asked if he believes the Constitution applies to President Trump. ""The Constitution applies to everybody, but there are very deliberate processes for amending the Constitution and a pathway there, and those were built in by the founders, the framers,"" Van Epps said. His opponent, State Rep. Aftyn Behn, (D-Nashville), said a key difference between the two, is she would immediately call for full disclosure of convicted sex trafficker Jeffry Epstein's files. Van Epps said he supports the approach favored by the House Speaker and President Trump, who has told supporters there is nothing to see there. He was asked, ""The files are there, why not just release them?"" Van Epps responded, ""They are taking a deliberative approach with subpoena power so they can fully investigate the situation and hold those accountable that need to be held accountable for the heinous crimes that happened."" Behn said on Inside Politics last week that affordability and reversing the cuts from the ""Big Ugly Bill"" would be her focus. ""If you think things are going well, I am not your candidate. If you are upset with the cost of living and the chaos of our federal and state government, then I am your candidate,"" she said. Van Epps called Behn a ""socialist"" but said he would also focus on the economy. ""I think we are moving in a great direction, but we've got work to do. The cost of living is too high; inflation is still too high. The Republicans have advanced very sensible good solutions,"" Van Epps said. He said his first bill as a congressman, if we wins, would focus on helping veterans. The full interview with Matt Van Epps airs on Inside Politics, Friday at 7pm on NewsChannel 5 Plus and throughout the weekend. It is also available as a podcast, just enter ""Inside Politics Nashville"" and start listening. You can also listen to the entire interview with democrat Aftyn Behn from last week.

USC cutting 259 jobs as it tackles rising $230 million deficit,"The University of Southern California began cutting 259 jobs on Friday as it tackles a rising operating deficit of more than $230 million Since July 9, USC has laid off — or is in the process of terminating — 975 people throughout the university system’s nearly 24,600 faculty and staff. That tally doesn’t include 9,185 student workers. The university is “reducing and reorganizing its workforce due to cutbacks in funding and necessary budget reductions,” wrote Melissa Gerdes-Leonard, associate vice president of client services with USC’s human resources department, in an Oct. 27 letter filed with the state’s Employment Development Department. Also see: USC won’t sign Trump compact on federal funding The latest round of layoffs are happening at USC’s University Park, a leafy 229-acre main campus for the institution’s academic schools and residential buildings near Exposition Park in downtown Los Angeles. After the cuts are completed Dec. 31, USC will have shed 616 people on its main campus, or two-thirds of the workforce laid off to date. Some of the positions cut include a marketing director, procurement specialist, research administrator, office managers, library supervisor, event and facilities managers and instructional lab technicians. Gerdes-Leonard couldn’t be reached for comment, but USC spokesman Paul McQuiston confirmed the layoffs were coming as a result of the operating deficit and girding for cuts in federal funding. An update on the budget situation is expected next week. In a July 14 letter to faculty and staff, Interim President Byung-soo Kim announced spending cuts amid reductions to the university’s federal funding and inefficiencies to USC’s operating model. Kim reported the university lost more than $200 million in the 2025 fiscal year ending June 30, an increase from a $158 million deficit in 2024. Andrew Guzman, provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs, said at an Academic Senate meeting on Sept. 17 that USC had a projected structural deficit of $230 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. He outlined a plan of “personnel actions” and budget cuts to save $400 million through the end of the current fiscal year. Since the release of Kim’s letter in July, the scale of the layoffs has grown. The Viterbi School of Engineering laid off 55 professors, academic program directors, adjunct and clinical instructors and student services advisers, while the USC Health Sciences Campus laid off 151 — including several at the Keck School of Medicine, which includes a teaching hospital, specialized cancer hospital, community hospitals, and outpatient clinics throughout Southern California, and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center.

"Tinubu to Trump: Nigeria’s constitution protects every faith, intolerance is not our identity","President Bola Tinubu has rejected United States President Donald Trump’s decision to redesignate Nigeria as a “country of particular concern” over alleged religious persecution. In a statement on Saturday, Tinubu said Nigeria remains a democracy anchored on constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion and belief. “Nigeria stands firmly as a democracy governed by constitutional guarantees of religious liberty,” the president said. “The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.” Trump had on Friday announced via his Truth Social platform that Nigeria had been redesignated on the US religious freedom watchlist as a “country of particular concern”. The move follows growing criticism by some US lawmakers, American evangelical groups and lobbyists who allege persecution of Christians in parts of Nigeria. However, Tinubu described those claims as inaccurate and unhelpful, adding that his administration has maintained open and active engagement with leaders of both major religions since assuming office in 2023. “Since 2023, our administration has maintained an open and active engagement with Christian and Muslim leaders alike and continues to address security challenges which affect citizens across faiths and regions,” he said. Tinubu said his government continues to invest in security reforms to protect communities from terrorism and banditry, regardless of religious affiliation. He noted that violent groups operating in parts of the country target both Christians and Muslims, undermining national peace and unity. “Religious freedom and tolerance have been core tenets of our collective identity and shall always remain so. Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it,” the president said. He reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to collaborating with the US and other international partners to deepen understanding, promote coexistence, and strengthen mechanisms that protect vulnerable communities. “Our administration is committed to working with the United States government and the international community to deepen understanding and cooperation on protection of communities of all faiths,” Tinubu said. “Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths. Intolerance is not our identity.” Nigeria was first designated as a “country of particular concern” by the Trump administration in 2020 but was removed from the list in 2021 by former President Joe Biden.",2025-11-01 20:07:00,Nigeria News
Loughrea edge neighbors St Thomas' in dramatic fashion in Galway SHC final,"Eanna Burke of St Thomas' in action against Kieran Hanrahan of Loughrea. Pic: Michael P Ryan/Sportsfile Galway SHC final: Loughrea 1-15 St Thomas’ 1-14 St Thomas’ suffered their first ever Galway SHC final defeat when they were edged out by their neighbours Loughrea at Pearse Stadium. St Thomas’ had won all eight previous finals but were chasing this one from the outset and never led in the contest played in difficult conditions in front of a crowd of 4,200. A goal in the final minute of regular time from Darren Shaughnessy proved decisive but St Thomas’ made them sweat all the way when Conor Cooney struck 1-1 in the dying minutes. St Thomas’ opted to play against the breeze in the opening half and found themselves 0-11 to 0-6 at the break with Loughrea getting off to a blistering start with points from Vince Morgan, Anthony Burns and Tiernan Killeen in the opening four minutes. The standard of hurling was good despite the wet and windy conditions and St Thomas’, with five players starting who had featured in all eight previous county title wins and another five on the bench with the full haul, used all their experience to get into the game. Conor Cooney got them off the mark with a point from play from 45 metres before captain Eanna Burke set up Darren Farrell for a point and cut the gap to 0-3 to 0-2 after nine minutes. Burns, who finished the opening half with four points from play, swapped scores with Cooney before Ian Hanrahan and Burns made it double scores at 0-6 to 0-3 at the end of the opening quarter. Loughrea, who had seven wides in the opening half with the wind, had a handful of goal chances but couldn’t convert against a St Thomas’ side who had only conceded one goal in their five games to the final. Another Cooney free, won by Eanna Ryan, reduced the margin but Loughrea hit a good patch and led by 0-9 to 0-4 after 25 minutes with Darren Shaughnessy, Burns and Vince Morgan finding the range. Farrell stemmed the flow with his second point but Loughrea led by five at the interval after Tiernan Killeen and Shane Morgan scored either side of Cooney’s third free for St Thomas’. Two frees from Cooney cut the gap to a goal inside three minutes of the restart but then after a free for all involving almost two dozen players, Loughrea extended their lead with efforts from Tiernan Killeen and Shaughnessy. Victor Manso became only the third St Thomas’ player to score when his point cut the gap to 0-13 to 0-9 after 43 minutes and Darragh Burke got the margin down to a goal going into the final quarter. Loughrea should have wrapped it up but Vince Morgan hit the crossbar after bearing down on goal and then moments later he flashed another goal effort wide from a tight angle from close range. The sides twice exchanged points before two more Cooney frees reduced the margin to 0-15 to 0-13 as the game went into the first of five minutes of stoppage time. Then Loughrea finally found the net when Burns set up Darren Shaughnessy and he soloed through to blast home from the left. But they were made sweat when Cooney landed a free and then blasted a free from 25 metres to the net in the final minute but Loughrea held on to retain their title. Scorers for Loughrea: D Shaughnessy 1-2, A Burns 0-5, T Killeen 0-3 (0-2f), S Morgan 0-2(0-2f), V Morgan 0-2, I Hanrahan 0-1. Scorers for St Thomas’: C Cooney 1-10 (1-9f), D Farrell 0-2, V Manso 0-1, D Burke 0-1.

"Sewing change, one bag at a time","In a province still drowning in polythene, despite ban, plastic bags continue to plague K-P Despite the ban on polythene bags, they are still being produced, sold, and used across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), laments Seema Babar, a social worker, who makes cloth bags and distributes them free of cost to people, in order to discourage the use of plastic bags and protect the environment from their harmful effects. Forty-nine-year-old Babar, from Pirpai village of Nowshera district in K-P is leading an initiative to reduce plastic waste in our society for the last some six years. “Few years ago, when the provincial government banned the manufacturing and sale of plastic bags in the province, I decided to make cotton bags and distribute them among people to raise awareness and promote the use of cloth bags, instead of plastic which cause pollution. “I first started this initiative in my village and later expanded the campaign to the main city and other parts of Nowshera district,” Seema Babar told The Express Tribune. She runs a women’s skill centre in her village, where women and young girls come to learn sewing and other handicraft skills. “During the training, the participants first make cloth bags using various types of raw and old fabric provided by relatives and neighbours. The bags carry anti-plastic and awareness slogans. After initial training, they practice stitching clothes and learn other skills,” she said. She added that in the past most plastic pollution was seen in urban areas, but now the waste can be observed in fields, crops, and irrigation channels in rural areas as well, affecting the environment where people once breathed fresh air and enjoyed lush greenery. “When the ban on use of plastic bags was imposed, people took our campaign seriously,” she says. “But over time, most of them do not pay attention to our cause and have gone back to using polythene bags.” While sharing people’s reactions, she said that when she and her team distributed cotton bags, many people accepted them with a smile, reflecting how a small group of females could change the community’s mindset to adopt reusable bags instead of plastic bags. According to Muhammad Tahir, a vegetable vendor in Mardan city, when the provincial government imposed a ban on polythene bags, the use of non-biodegradable bags decreased, and instead vendors and traders mostly began to use biodegradable plastic bags. “However, due to the low durability of biodegradable bags, lack of government monitoring, and customer demand, non-biodegradable bags have made a comeback and openly are used for daily shopping,” he added. A single cotton bag must be reused 50 to 150 times to have a lower environmental impact than a single-use plastic bag, according to a 2020 United Nations report. However, the exact number depends on the specific impact being measured, as a UK study found a cotton bag needs to be used 131 times to offset climate change, and thousands of times for comparable overall environmental impact. The effectiveness of cotton bags hinges on consumers consistently reusing them, as the production of one cotton bag is more energy-intensive than one plastic bag. Cotton bags have undoubtedly transformed consumer trends by offering a sustainable and practical alternative to single-use plastic bags. As consumers continue to prioritize sustainability in their purchasing decisions, the popularity of cotton bags is expected to grow even further, driving positive change towards a greener and more environmentally conscious future. By choosing cotton bags, consumers can make a tangible difference in reducing plastic waste and promoting a more sustainable way of life. In 2017, the provincial government of KP banned the use of polythene bags. However, after number of litigations, in 2022, amendments were introduced to the KP Environmental Protection Act 2014, which enforced a complete ban on plastic shopping bags across the province. According to officials of the KP Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), letters were dispatched to development authorities such as the Galiyat Development Authority, Kaghan Development Authority and Kumrat Development Authority to ensure implementation of the ban in all jurisdictions. All commissioners across the province were also directed to carry out operations against the use of these hazardous bags, they added. The EPA has prosecuted manufacturing units and wholesale dealers who violated the law, and soon these powers will be delegated to deputy and assistant commissioners as well, officials said. According to data obtained from The Water and Sanitation Services Company Peshawar (WSSP), the company collects about 500 tons of solid waste every day from 42 union councils of district Peshawar, which is then dumped at an authorised site on the outskirts of the provincial capital, Peshawar. The data shows that the waste consists of 10 percent plastic, 49 percent biodegradable materials, 9.4 percent paper, and 11 percent wood, among other materials. According to the company, the waste is scientifically managed by covering it with soil and spraying it before disposal. A sanitary landfill site has also been established to ensure that underground water reserves are not contaminated by the waste. Babar said that in the early days of the campaign, the district administration and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) supported her cause and extended their help, but over time, their interest has faded away. She added that even the use of biodegradable polythene bags has is not seen any more as people are seen using non-biodegradable bags which created pollution. “In the early days of the plastic bag ban, the district administration and NGOs arranged awareness sessions in different areas in which we also participated,” she says. “But now such activities are no longer taking place and we take the initiative to carry out awareness drives independently.” “Our mission to promote the use of cotton bags instead of plastic bags still continues,” Babar shares. “The women working at my centre, along with my neighbours and relatives, still use cotton bags, which is very important for raising awareness and discouraging the use of plastic bags.” According to United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 2023 report, Pakistan produced 3.9 million tonnes of plastic waste in 2020, over 65 per cent of which was mismanaged. The report also states that 18 per cent of municipal solid waste produced in Pakistan is plastics. Only three percent of plastic used by the manufacturing industry in Pakistan is recycled material. In 2019, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) imposed a ban on the manufacturing, import, sale, purchase, storage, and use of polythene bags in the Islamabad Capital Territory. About the adverse impact of polythene bags on the environment, professor Dr Muhammad Nafees Khan, a faculty member of the department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Peshawar, told The Express Tribune that the regular use of polythene bags was a major threat to the environment. He added that when they are burned, they cause air pollution, when they are thrown into rivers, they pollute the water and endanger aquatic life and when they are dumped in the earth, they cause reduced crop production. Dr Khan added that placing food items with a temperature from 20 to 25 degrees celsius in polythene bags can cause cancer in the human body, as cancer-causing aldehyde compounds leach from the bag into the food. “When plastic bags are exposed to ultraviolet radiation and water, they break down into microplastics, which, when entering the human body through breathing, can affect the lungs,” he said, adding that due to the choking of drainage systems, they are also causing urban flooding in city areas. He mentioned that the best alternative to these hazardous bags is cotton bags and stressed that raising awareness is very important for promoting their use. “To reduce and control plastic waste, discarded polythene bags should be converted into Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) for use in large industries such as steel mills, cement factories, and other industrial units that require high temperatures for production,” he suggests. “This approach will help keep the environment free from plastic waste, while industries will benefit from a cheaper source of energy.” Dr Syed Waqas Ali Shah, a faculty member in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, told The Express Tribune that plastic bags have a harmful impact on both climate change and natural habitats. Since polythene bags were made from fossil fuels, he explained that the industries that produce them emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming and air pollution. “Because of their easy use, the consumption of these hazardous bags is also on a large scale. According to a report, around one million plastic bags are used worldwide every minute. In developing countries like Pakistan, most of them are dumped in open areas instead of being recycled, which has adverse effects on the environment, ecosystems, and living beings as well,” he says. Syed Waqas Ali Shah pointed out that due to the rapid production of plastic bags in large quantities, more landfill space is occupied and dumping them on the ground causes frequent clogging of drains and waterways both in villages and city areas as its decomposition takes hundreds of years. He said that when those bags were flow into rivers and seas they polluted water and endangers marine life. “Many aquatic animals consume plastic bags thinking they are food, which affects their stomachs and intestines and often leads to their deaths. In the rivers of the Peshawar Valley, we once observed a population of turtles that has now almost vanished. In other countries, similar species have become rare due to the presence of plastic bags in rivers and seas,” Shah explained. He suggested that, along with the implementation of laws, raising public awareness about the hazards of polythene bags and imposing heavy taxes on their production is also crucial. As Babar’s village, Pirpai, is located near the Kabul River in Nowshera district, the residents are vulnerable to floods during the monsoon season. Apart from making cloth bags, Babar has also taken initiatives to address the adverse impacts of climate change, which have changed the pattern and severity of rainfall water level in rivers. “As the district youth coordinator, I have formed several groups of young women who receive training and visit local communities to raise awareness about climate change, tree plantation, energy saving and water conservation in Nowshera district,” she shares, adding that these members also arrange free plants for plantation drives and coordinate with the district administration to take part in government sessions.

Europe Leads the Charge on Aviation Sustainability with SAF Mandates and Innovation,"Published on November 2, 2025 Europe is steadily advancing toward greener skies, with the aviation industry accelerating its shift towards sustainability. The key driver? Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a biofuel made from renewable resources that reduces carbon emissions and is integral to achieving Europe’s ambitious carbon-neutral goals. With recent regulations, such as the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, the aviation industry is witnessing a transformative shift in fuel consumption.What Are SAF Mandates?Advertisement Since January 2025, European airports have been mandated to blend a minimum of 2% SAF with conventional jet fuel. This percentage will increase incrementally, reaching 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. These regulations are part of the European Union’s broader strategy to decarbonize the aviation sector. ReFuelEU Aviation, an EU regulation first drafted in 2021, aims to make SAF the primary fuel for aircraft departing from European airports, bolstering sustainable aviation while fostering innovation and growth in the biofuel sector.The Role of SAF in DecarbonizationAdvertisement The EU’s SAF mandate plays a critical role in achieving the aviation industry’s carbon neutrality by 2050. Aviation contributes significantly to global emissions, and while carbon offsetting strategies exist, SAF provides a tangible solution for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint. As SAF production scales, its environmental benefits will only increase, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and helping meet global climate goals.Challenges to SAF Production and the Need for InvestmentAdvertisement Despite the positive impact of SAF, production in Europe is not without its hurdles. SAF is still in its early stages of development, and Europe’s capacity to produce it is far from meeting the growing demand. The cost of SAF production is high, and regulatory uncertainty remains. While countries like the US have provided financial incentives to encourage SAF production, Europe’s reliance on regulatory measures, like the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, falls short in addressing the upfront investment challenges faced by SAF producers.Europe’s SAF Supply Chain Needs StrengtheningThe current SAF supply chain in Europe is still underdeveloped. While demand is increasing, the supply remains limited, creating an imbalance in the market. Europe’s refineries are adapting to produce SAF, but with geopolitical challenges and concerns about feedstock supply chains, such as the reliance on used cooking oil, the region faces risks that may hinder long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, policymakers must focus on strengthening the SAF supply chain through incentives, clearer legislative frameworks, and better financial backing.Aviation Leaders Push for Clearer LegislationThe aviation industry is committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but experts argue that more coordinated financial support is needed. Business aviation manufacturers and industry stakeholders have urged the EU to simplify regulations and provide stronger financial incentives. According to Kyle Martin, VP of European affairs at the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), a shift in focus towards innovation and competitiveness, rather than solely sustainability, is vital for achieving both goals.At the same time, European authorities have expressed caution about the pace of SAF development. In February 2025, the Airports Council International (ACI) Europe warned that further EU support was necessary to meet the ambitious targets set for 2050. The alliance called for a more comprehensive SAF industrial policy, increased financing, and a reduction in the regulatory burden.The Future of SAF in Europe: Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and Next-Generation FuelsAs Europe looks to expand its SAF production capabilities, next-generation fuels are gaining attention. Power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, produced using green hydrogen and carbon feedstocks, offer a promising alternative to current SAF pathways. Europe is exploring these innovative solutions as part of its commitment to reducing reliance on traditional fossil fuels. While PtL fuels hold significant potential, they are still in the pilot phase, and scaling up production will require substantial investment and technological advancements.Opportunities for Travelers: A Greener Way to FlyFor global travelers, the shift towards SAF means cleaner air travel options in the future. Major airports in Europe, including Paris Le Bourget, London Luton, and London Farnborough, are leading the way in SAF adoption. As demand grows, airports and airlines are working to ensure SAF availability for passengers. This transition not only benefits the environment but also aligns with travelers’ increasing desire for sustainable travel options.By supporting the adoption of SAF, travelers can contribute to a greener aviation industry while enjoying the benefits of cleaner, more sustainable flights. As Europe’s aviation industry navigates these challenges and opportunities, the future of air travel looks brighter and more eco-friendly than ever.Conclusion: Europe’s Bold Steps Towards a Sustainable Aviation FutureEurope’s commitment to sustainable aviation through SAF mandates is a significant step in the fight against climate change. While challenges remain in scaling production, the EU’s proactive approach is setting the stage for a greener future. By prioritizing SAF, Europe is not only reducing aviation emissions but also paving the way for a global shift towards sustainable travel.

Aviation contributes significantly to global emissions, and while carbon offsetting strategies exist, SAF provides a tangible solution for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint. As SAF production scales, its environmental benefits will only increase, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and helping meet global climate goals.Challenges to SAF Production and the Need for InvestmentAdvertisement Despite the positive impact of SAF, production in Europe is not without its hurdles. SAF is still in its early stages of development, and Europe’s capacity to produce it is far from meeting the growing demand. The cost of SAF production is high, and regulatory uncertainty remains. While countries like the US have provided financial incentives to encourage SAF production, Europe’s reliance on regulatory measures, like the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, falls short in addressing the upfront investment challenges faced by SAF producers.Europe’s SAF Supply Chain Needs StrengtheningThe current SAF supply chain in Europe is still underdeveloped. While demand is increasing, the supply remains limited, creating an imbalance in the market. Europe’s refineries are adapting to produce SAF, but with geopolitical challenges and concerns about feedstock supply chains, such as the reliance on used cooking oil, the region faces risks that may hinder long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, policymakers must focus on strengthening the SAF supply chain through incentives, clearer legislative frameworks, and better financial backing.Aviation Leaders Push for Clearer LegislationThe aviation industry is committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but experts argue that more coordinated financial support is needed. Business aviation manufacturers and industry stakeholders have urged the EU to simplify regulations and provide stronger financial incentives. According to Kyle Martin, VP of European affairs at the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), a shift in focus towards innovation and competitiveness, rather than solely sustainability, is vital for achieving both goals.At the same time, European authorities have expressed caution about the pace of SAF development. In February 2025, the Airports Council International (ACI) Europe warned that further EU support was necessary to meet the ambitious targets set for 2050. The alliance called for a more comprehensive SAF industrial policy, increased financing, and a reduction in the regulatory burden.The Future of SAF in Europe: Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and Next-Generation FuelsAs Europe looks to expand its SAF production capabilities, next-generation fuels are gaining attention. Power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, produced using green hydrogen and carbon feedstocks, offer a promising alternative to current SAF pathways. Europe is exploring these innovative solutions as part of its commitment to reducing reliance on traditional fossil fuels. While PtL fuels hold significant potential, they are still in the pilot phase, and scaling up production will require substantial investment and technological advancements.Opportunities for Travelers: A Greener Way to FlyFor global travelers, the shift towards SAF means cleaner air travel options in the future. Major airports in Europe, including Paris Le Bourget, London Luton, and London Farnborough, are leading the way in SAF adoption. As demand grows, airports and airlines are working to ensure SAF availability for passengers. This transition not only benefits the environment but also aligns with travelers’ increasing desire for sustainable travel options.By supporting the adoption of SAF, travelers can contribute to a greener aviation industry while enjoying the benefits of cleaner, more sustainable flights. As Europe’s aviation industry navigates these challenges and opportunities, the future of air travel looks brighter and more eco-friendly than ever.Conclusion: Europe’s Bold Steps Towards a Sustainable Aviation FutureEurope’s commitment to sustainable aviation through SAF mandates is a significant step in the fight against climate change. While challenges remain in scaling production, the EU’s proactive approach is setting the stage for a greener future.

TV scores twice in second half to claim title,"Twin Valley and Caledonia United battled through a scoreless first half and after more than 10 minutes ticked off the second-half clock, fans had to be wondering if a goal would ever come. Then it happened on Brayden Brown's direct kick from about 20 yards 11:11 into the second half. ""We thought (at halftime) that we would score on a set piece. We work on those ad nauseum,"" Twin Valley coach Buddy Hayford said. Brown's ball that went just under the crossbar before rippling the high portion of the net was the impetus for the 2-0 victory and the Wildcats' state championship. Brown said he practices direct kicks at different distances. ""It felt good,"" Brown said of the moment the ball left his foot. ""I bent it a little bit. ""I was visioning it going under the bar and into the net."" Brown knew it had to be a great shot to beat Cal United goalie Josh Peterson. ""He is a really good keeper. He made some great saves,"" Brown said. Petersen was so good that he prompted Hayford to change his game plan at halftime. ""We made an adjustment because their keeper was so mobile,"" Hayford said. ""He was able to pick everything off so we stopped being so vertical and instead played the ball wide. We stopped playing through balls and made more angle passes."" A one-goal lead with that much time remaining did little to calm Hayford's nerves. ""The second goal was the thing. I didn't feel good about a one-goal lead against a team like that. They were 16-0 and very good,"" Hayford said. The insurance goal came with 13:04 remaining, a low bullet into the corner off the foot of Niko Gerding. ""Niko's shot was awesome. He kept it low and it was against the keeper's momentum,"" Hayford said. One reason the pad goal was so long in coming was a strong Cal defense spearheaded by Monaco. He had several clears under very heavy pressure. Early in the game, Hayford had to admit he was given some doubt about the Wildcats chances to take down the undefeated opponent. That was because his team lost two-time All State center back Chris Eckert and he never did return. ""I said at that time, 'we could be in trouble,'"" Hayford said. But the Wildcats passed the next-man-up mentality with flying colors. Zack Mercier stepped into fill Eckert's role. ""He was terrific,"" Hayford said. Colton Corey saw more minutes after the injury. ""He was untested but played very well,"" Hayford said. ""And Brian Sullivan won balls in the back."" Brayden Brown and Gerding were stellar in controlling the midfield area just as they had been all year. ""Carson McHale was a bulldog up front and his motor ran all 80 minutes,"" Hayford said. Cal United coach Peter Stratman said that to him, the game had the feel of one where the team scoring first would win. ""I thought there was a momentum shift after they scored,"" Stratman said. Stratman knows that could have just as well been one of his players finding the net first. During an even first half, they threatened goalie Kaelyn Lackey and his defense several times. Caledonia applied early pressure with River Thibault getting a good, unobstructed look and firing barely wide of the far post after only two minutes had elapsed. ""The game was frenetic in the first 10 minutes and then when everyone settled down it was an even game for the rest of the first half,"" Stratman said. Eli Russell unloaded a testing shot that Lackey made a great deflection of and Cal United came close to capitalizing on the rebound. Cal also had some scoring opportunities in the first half on balls that ping ponged around in the box, something that did not please Hayford. ""No bouncing balls in the back. We've got clear them out with our heads. If we don't, it is going to cost us,"" Hayford yelled to his defenders. But the half ended without a goal and, out of respect for Petersen, Hayford altered the method of attacking. The adjustment gave the Wildcats a significant territorial advantage as they clearly won the second 40 minutes. Cal United, a team that boasts players from Danville, Twinfield and Cabot, took the loss hard. A defeat in a state title game is never easy and it only compounds the hurt when you aren't accustomed to losing. Caledonia went through the season beating all comers and took the same 16-0 record that Twin Valley brought into Saturday night's championship game. Playing their final game for Cal United were seniors Russell, Jola Otten, Ben Monaco, Sean Lehoe, Samson Kitonga, Sam McLane, Alijah Andrews and Petersen. They couldn't appreciate being an unbeaten team all regular season. The sting of this night was still too much. But they will eventually. It was a magical season. Twin Valley seniors Lackey, Eckert, Tucker Magnant, Steven Oyer, Pacei Reynolds, McHale, Max Nido, Nrian Sullivan and Max Mercier went out the way everyone wants to go out the door. But only team can. It was the Twin Valley Wildcats. Twin Valley fan Frances Cunningham delivered a beautiful rendition of the national anthem, but the song that will stay with the Wildcat players forever was ""We Are the Champions"" by Queen as it blared over the loudspeaker at Rutland's Alumni Field. tom.haley@rutlandherald.com Sportswriter",2025-11-01 20:43:00,Rutland Herald
Bihar JD(U) candidate Anant Singh arrested over Jan Suraaj worker's death in Mokama,"Controversial former Bihar MLA Anant Singh , who seeks to reclaim Mokama seat on a ticket of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), was arrested in a late-night operation on Saturday (November 1, 2025) in connection with the murder of Jan Suraaj supporter Dular Chand Yadav, officials said. Mr. Singh, who has been under the scanner since the killing of Yadav, who recently clashed with his sympathisers, was picked up from his house in Barh, about 200 km from the State capital. Police also arrested two other persons, Manikant Thakur and Ranjeet Ram, who were also present when the incident took place. All three will soon be produced before the magistrate. Yadav died while campaigning for Jan Suraaj Party’s candidate Piyush Priyadarshi in Patna’s Mokama area on Thursday. The incident had taken place in the Mokama Taal area, which is close to Bhadaur and Ghoswari police stations. The incident had taken place close to the Bhadaur and Ghoswari police stations in the Mokama area. Addressing a late-night joint press conference with Patna District Magistrate Thyagarajan S. M., Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Patna, Kartikeya Sharma, said, “Police have arrested three persons — Anant Singh, Manikant Thakur and Ranjeet Ram — in connection with the murder of Dular Chand Yadav.” According to Yadav’s post-mortem report, he died of cardiorespiratory failure due to shock caused by injury to the heart and lungs by a hard and blunt substance, the SSP said. “Therefore, the post-mortem report and preliminary investigation suggest that it’s a case of murder,” he said. Investigations also revealed that all three were present at the time of the incident, Mr. Sharma said. “They have been arrested as part of a police investigation into the murder case of Yadav. A total of four FIRs, one pertaining to the violation of the model code of conduct, have been registered by the police to investigate the incident,” the SSP said, adding that Singh was named in one of the FIRs. The multiple-term former MLA, whose wife Neelam Devi currently represents the Mokama seat, has also been booked for model code of conduct violation as instances of his moving about in large cavalcades have come to the fore. When asked about the killing of Yadav, Mr. Singh had admitted to a clash between his supporters and the deceased, but also sought to put the blame on Suraj Bhan, his old rival in the underworld and local politics, whose wife Veena Devi is contesting the seat on an RJD ticket. Yadav, a dreaded gangster of the 1990s known to be at odds with Anant Singh, was supporting Priyadarshi Piyush, a political greenhorn fielded by Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party. Meanwhile, the Election Commission on Saturday ordered the transfer of Patna Superintendent of Police (Rural) and action against three other officials, taking a stern view of violence in Mokama, involving the killing of Yadav. “The Commission directed that Vikram Sihag, Superintendent of Police (Rural), Patna, may also be transferred. Hence, a panel of officers for posting a substitute in his place may be sent urgently,” the poll authority told the state chief electoral officer on Saturday. It ordered the appointment of new officials to replace the sub-divisional officer of Barh, who is also the returning officer of Mokama assembly seat, sub-divisional police officer Barh-1, and sub-divisional police officer Barh-2. While ordering disciplinary proceedings against the three, it also directed that Abhishek Singh, the sub-divisional police officer of Barh-2, be also placed under suspension. Bihar goes to the polls in two phases on November 6 and 11, while votes will be counted on November 14.",2025-11-01 20:42:54,The Hindu
Pakistan reopens Afghan border as ceasefire holds,"US Torkham border reopens for repatriation; Thousands return home via Chaman border Pakistan on Saturday reopened the Torkham border crossing in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa for Afghan refugees returning to their country, ending a nearly two-week closure following deadly clashes between border forces last month. Meanwhile, nearly 10,700 individuals returned through the Chaman border in a single day as authorities expanded the process to the crossing. The repatriation of Afghan families with or without any travel or identity documents was abruptly suspended on October 11 following border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which continued for days before a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on October 19. Pakistan had closed all its borders with Afghanistan for all types of movement. Since then, a large number of returning families had been impatiently waiting for the reopening of the Torkham border. Trade between the countries has remained suspended since then, leading to increased prices of essential goods, especially tomatoes. Although Islamabad and Kabul on Friday decided to extend the ceasefire, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi stated that the ""border remains closed for trade for now"" and resumption of trade would depend on the security situation. Officials previously said that all relevant staff members had been informed to ensure their presence on duty on Saturday morning. It was not clear whether Pakistanis stranded in Afghanistan would be allowed to return. According to official figures, approximately 1.56 million Afghan nationals have now returned to their homeland under the government's ongoing repatriation drive. The process was being conducted in accordance with legal and administrative protocols, ensuring that every individual's documents are verified before crossing the border. Authorities assured that the repatriation initiative was being carried out in a dignified and orderly manner and has now been extended to Torkham following its recent reopening. Officials said the Frontier Corps (FC) and the civil administration have set up temporary shelters, food supplies, and medical facilities for departing families. The state has ensured that all humanitarian needs of Afghan refugees are addressed during the transition, an official said. Similarly, Khyber Deputy Commissioner Bilal Rao confirmed the reopening, saying that the crossing had resumed operations to facilitate the repatriation of Afghan nationals. Afghan and Pakistani officials, including Khizer Shah, spokesperson of the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul, also verified the development. The repatriation process for Afghan families, both with and without valid travel or identity documents, had been suspended since October 11, when cross-border clashes broke out between security forces of the two countries. The border skirmishes, which lasted several days, were halted only after a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on October 19. Following the violence, Pakistan had closed all border crossings with Afghanistan for both trade and travel, leaving thousands of returning families stranded on either side. The shutdown also disrupted bilateral trade, triggering a spike in prices of essential goods, particularly perishable items like tomatoes, in local markets. Although Islamabad and Kabul agreed on Friday to extend the ceasefire, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the border remains closed for trade for now, adding that commercial activity would resume only after a review of the security situation. According to officials in Khyber, all relevant border staff had been directed to report for duty early Saturday to facilitate the return of refugees. However, it was not immediately clear whether Pakistani nationals stranded in Afghanistan would also be allowed to cross back into the country.

'India tried to bribe Pak fisherman into spying',"US He drew parallels between, failed Operation Sindoor, current propaganda campaign Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Saturday revealed that India's intelligence agency had attempted to recruit a Pakistani fisherman for espionage by offering him money. Addressing a joint press conference in Islamabad alongside Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, Chaudhry said the incident was ""India's new propaganda operation, which has now been fully exposed"". He said the fisherman, identified as Ijaz Mallah, had been detained by the Indian Coast Guard in September and was subsequently coerced and bribed with Rs95,000 to take part in anti-Pakistan propaganda. ""This is part of a continuous psychological and informational war being waged by Indian intelligence agencies against Pakistan,"" he said, adding that the country's security institutions remain vigilant to counter such attempts. Chaudhry credited Pakistan's media and security institutions for ""ensuring the triumph of truth in this information war,"" and praised their responsible reporting in the face of what he termed ""yellow propaganda"". He drew parallels between the failed Operation Sindoor and the current propaganda campaign, describing them as repeated attempts by India to ""erase the humiliation of past failures"". ""After failing in Operation Sindoor, and even in sports arenas, efforts have continued to create false narratives, from fabricated operations to fake encounters. But every such attempt has been exposed,"" he said. The minister added that evidence of financial transactions and communication between Indian handlers and Mallah had been recovered. He said fake media credentials, uniforms and documents were also used to mask the operation under seemingly credible identities. He stressed Pakistan was a responsible state, saying, ""Pakistan respects the sovereignty of other nations and ensures its soil is not used against anyone. We expect the same in return"". He urged the international community and independent media to review the evidence and recognise the operation for what it was, ""a desperate bid to build a false narrative ahead of elections and amid growing political tensions in India"". ""Just like in the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the truth is once again before the world. India has been caught red-handed,"" Chaudhry added.

President salutes heroes who liberated G-B,"US Zardari vows to make Gilgit-Baltistan a model region President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday joined the people of Gilgit-Baltistan in marking the region's 78th Independence Day, paying glowing tribute to the heroes who liberated G-B from Dogra rule and reaffirming the government's resolve to turn the region into a model of development, justice and equality. Addressing the central ceremony held at the Army Helipad Ground in Gilgit, President Zardari lauded the people of G-B for standing shoulder to shoulder with the rest of Pakistan for more than seven decades, safeguarding its borders and carrying the national flag to the world's highest peaks. ""This region is not only the crown of Pakistan but also our northern gateway, a symbol of lasting friendship with China,"" he said. He said the Karakoram Highway stands as a living testament to that friendship, while the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has brought new avenues for trade, livelihoods and connectivity throughout the region. The president emphasised that ensuring the fruits of development reach every valley and village must remain a shared national goal, fostering prosperity for all. The president said G-B's freedom struggle serves as a reminder of the unfinished journey of their ""brothers and sisters"" in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). ""While you enjoy liberty and rights under the flag of Pakistan, they continue to face occupation and repression,"" he said. ""We stand with them till they achieve freedom in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions and their own aspirations."" Calling G-B his ""second home"", the president recalled that the people of the region gained their independence through their own struggle and voluntarily chose to join Pakistan. He said the history of G-B was filled with acts of unmatched bravery and sacrifice, noting that during the liberation movement of 1947, 1,700 people embraced martyrdom and another 30,000 were wounded. He highlighted that successive PPP governments had made landmark contributions to G-B's progress. ""Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto showed his affection for the people of G-B by abolishing the Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR) in 1974 and merging princely states into a single administrative unit,"" he said. ""Later, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto introduced a structural governance system, and the PPP federal government gave G-B a legislative assembly and the offices of governor and chief minister through constitutional amendments."" Zardari said PPP workers from G-B had also played an active role in the country's democratic struggles, with many sacrificing their lives in Karachi and Rawalpindi. He urged the authorities to expand access to education and healthcare throughout the region and said G-B's vast water and natural resources could be utilised for power generation. The area, he added, held immense tourism potential and could even operate its own airline to promote it. The president denounced the persecution of Muslims in India and praised Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah for creating a separate homeland where all citizens could enjoy freedom and dignity. Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, in his address, paid tribute to the martyrs of the 1947 liberation movement and thanked President Zardari for gracing the ceremony. He said the PPP government's 2009 reforms had given G-B its identity and added that integrating the region into Pakistan's constitutional framework – without undermining the Kashmir issue – would thwart India's malicious designs. The chief minister lauded the sacrifices of Pakistan's armed forces and the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir, noting that Operation Bunyan al-Marsoos had further strengthened G-B's security and prestige. President Zardari later reviewed the parade and witnessed a colourful march-past and cultural floats representing all three divisions of G-B, which drew loud applause from the audience. The event was attended by the governor, chief minister, members of the legislative assembly, Commander X Corps Lt Gen Ahsan Amir Nawaz, Force Commander Northern Areas Maj Gen Syed Imtiaz Gilani, senior officials, and a large number of citizens. Earlier, the president was warmly received at Gilgit Airport by Governor Syed Mehdi Shah and the chief minister.

"Extend ITR filing due date, HC tells CBDT","The Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to extend the due date for filing Income Tax Returns (ITR) for assessees who are required to submit audit reports. The order has been pronounced by Justice Lisa Gill and Justice Meenakshi I Mehta on four writ petitions filed by the Jalandhar Income Tax Bar Association, Taxation Bar Association, Pathankot, and Income Tax practitioners. They approached the high court seeking a direction to the CBDT to extend the due date for filing of tax audit reports for a reasonable period from September 30 and as a necessary corollary to further extend the due date for filing tax returns. Counsels for petitioners submitted that audit reports and tax returns are mandatorily to be e-filled. Forms of e-filing of audit report and tax returns were made available effectively by the department only in August, thereby leading to considerable reduction of time period available to petitioners for filing tax audit reports. Certain changes were carried out in respect to tax audit reports vide notification dated March 28, 2025, however, e-filing utility was made available on August 14. The department itself acknowledged substantial changes and time required for system readiness when it extended due date for filing of tax returns in certain categories of persons other than companies. The Bench said repeated adjournments had been granted at fervent request of counsel for the Union of India on the premise that proposal regarding extension of due date for filing of Income Tax Returns in the case of auditable assessees for sssessment year 2025-26 is under submission for early decision. Position is no different even today despite of specific and categorical order dated October 13 passed by the High Court of Gujarat, which has admittedly been attained finality. The Bench said, “We find no ground whatsoever to further adjourn these writ petitions as has been suggested. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances as above, all four writ petitions are disposed of while directing respondent – the CBDT to issue necessary circular in exercise of power under Section 119 of the Act to extend the due date for filing of returns by assessees required to file audit report as per clause (a) of Explanation 2 to sub-section (1) of Section 139 of the Act or required to file report of audit under provisions of the Act for financial year 2024-2025 (Assessment year 2025-26) to November 30, 2025.

"International experts show interest in importing fruits, cut flowers from Bilaspur","The Himachal Pradesh Sub-tropical Horticulture, Irrigation and Value Addition Project (HP SHIVA) has drawn international attention of a high-profile business delegation from Dubai comprising Abdulla Al Ali and Sagheer Khan, who visited the state and held a high-level meeting with Project Director Dr Devender Singh Thakur, in Bilaspur today. An HP SHIVA Project Management Unit (PMU) team of the Directorate of Horticulture was also present at the meeting. Dr Thakur said the meeting focused on exploring export opportunities for fruits, including sweet oranges, pomegranates and cut flowers, including roses and carnations, produced under the HP SHIVA Project to Middle East markets, especially Dubai. He said a detailed overview of the project’s progress and achievements was given to the international guests. He said scientifically developed horticulture clusters had been established across seven districts in the state, including Bilaspur, Hamirpur, Kangra, Mandi, Una, Solan, and Sirmaur. These clusters cultivate high-yield and export-oriented varieties that meet all international standards of colour, size, sweetness and shelf life, he said. Dr Thakur said farmers were trained in good agricultural practices (GAP), precision irrigation, fertigation and integrated pest and nutrient management. He said, “There is a remarkable improvement in both the quality and consistency of production. The cluster-based model has enabled product traceability, quality consistency and volume aggregation that are key prerequisites for international buyers.” During inspection of the Karot cluster in Bilaspur, the Dubai representatives appreciated the quality of the produce, describing it as being on par with international standards, and expressed strong interest in establishing long-term export partnerships with the HP SHIVA initiative.

Alonzo Highsmith Has Interest in Dolphins GM Job,"Posted by Mike Oliva | Nov 1, 2025 | 2025 Season, Dolphins News | 0 Alonzo Highsmith Has Interest in Dolphins GM Job Former Miami Hurricanes running back and current New England Patriots personnel executive Alonzo Highsmith has expressed interest in the open Miami Dolphins general manager position to people, according to Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald. Highsmith was the 3rd overall pick of the 1987 NFL Draft by the Houston Oilers. During his NFL career, he played for Houston, Dallas, and Tampa. He also spent time on the Kansas City Chiefs practice squad his final year before retiring. Since retiring, Highsmith has pivoted and become an NFL Front Office executive. He got his start in Green Bay as a Senior Personnel Executive from 2012 to 2017. Then he moved to Seattle, where he was the Vice President of Player Personnel from 2018 to 2019. From 2020 to 2022, he was a personnel executive in Seattle. Then, in late 2022, he went back home to the Miami Hurricanes to be their GM of Football Operations for two seasons. And then in 2024, he became a personnel executive with the New England Patriots. At 60 years old, Highsmith is undoubtedly qualified to be an NFL general manager at this stage of his career, and the fact that he has spent time in two highly successful NFL front offices makes him an attractive candidate. With that said, there is no confirmation or report of Miami having interest in Highsmith; this is coming from Alonzo himself that he has interest in the open position. I fully expect the Miami Dolphins to cast a wide net in their search come January when they begin the process of finding a new general manager. It was reported Saturday morning by Dianna Russini that Miami is looking to reshape the vision of its front office, so do not expect Miami to only meet with a couple of people and make a quick hire come January 2026. I suspect this will drag out some, and the search will go into February, and we may not have an announcement on any new hire until around or after the Super Bowl. One thing that is ironic about this story is that before being hired by the Miami Dolphins as a scout in 2000, Chris Grier had worked for the Patriots. Like Highsmith does now.

Are the savings, however, worth it? Are you getting legitimate, high-quality fashion for a good price? It doesn't seem that way. Shein is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and only has a one-star customer review rating based on over 700 reviews on its website. Shein has also been involved in multiple lawsuits during its history. These lawsuits center on other fashion brands and artists accusing Shein of selling counterfeit products and stealing their designs. So that Coach handbag you found on Shein might not actually be Coach at all. Based in China, Shein was founded in 2008 by Chris Xu. It got its start selling wedding dresses before expanding into all of women's fashion and other miscellaneous products. It's grown to be a popular app, with billions in revenue and multiple manufacturing partnerships. It adds thousands of new items to its store daily, which can often be a red flag for quantity over quality. While you might be getting a good deal shopping at Shein — similar to Amazon's discount store Haul — it's a stretch to claim that this company is completely legit. Since Shein is not accredited by the BBB, it has not gone through the process to meet the organization's eight Standards for Trust. These standards include honest advertising, transparent business policies, responding quickly to disputes, and safeguarding customer data. While this does not necessarily mean Shein is dishonest and negligent, earning a BBB accreditation does go a long way in winning customer faith in a company's products and services. Customers are allowed to post their good and bad experiences with companies on the BBB page, even though it's not accredited. Shein's 1-star rating out of 5 possible stars is a strikingly dismal score. Complaints include items ordered not arriving and no money being returned, the wrong items being delivered, and counterfeit items that don't match the website description. It is worth noting, however, that Shein has an A rating on the BBB. The reason given is that Shein responds to customer complaints quickly. Letter grade ratings on the BBB are a direct reflection of the business's responsiveness to upset customers and are not influenced by reviews posted on the website. For comparison, three companies in Canada have earned F ratings. So when you take the whole package of no BBB accreditation, an A rating for responsiveness, and multiple customer complaints, you get a fuller picture of what to expect from shopping with Shein. Tapestry, the company that owns the fashion brand Coach, sued Shein in 2025, accusing the company of having third parties manufacture counterfeit Coach products and sell them on the website. These counterfeit items featured the Coach name and its well-known logo. In response, Shein claimed all of its products from third-party suppliers were legitimate and not knock-offs. Large companies aren't the only ones that feel their designs have been stolen by Shein. Small, independent fashion designers have also complained online about their handmade fashions being mass-produced by third parties through Shein without their permission. Shein has also been accused of copying the direct design of products, like Bottega Veneta's Cassette bag, often worn by celebrities. Shoppers may feel that they are getting a Hollywood-level bag at an ultra-cheap price. Unfortunately, there is little legal protection available for copies of unique designs outside of trademarked logos or similar brand-defining visuals. To Shein's credit, its ethical policies are stated clearly on its website. It emphasizes that its mission is to conduct business lawfully and responsibly. This includes the suppliers it works with agreeing to a set of standards and large sections about its commitment to safe work practices and no worker exploitation — the same type of issue that Temu has come under fire for. If you do shop at Shein, remember that sometimes a deal that seems too good is, in fact, too good to be true.",2025-11-01 21:17:00,Bgr
Why Kourtney Kardashian Is Reportedly ‘Upset’ With Kim And Khloé Amid New Season Of Their Reality Show,"The Kardashians started airing for fans with a Hulu subscription last week and, given the nature of the show, it's natural to expect drama. While in front of the camera, the Kardashian-Jenner family is pretty transparent and tends to be confrontational with each other. If a source is to be believed, though, Kourtney Kardashian is now unhappy about comments made by her sisters Kim and Khloé during their confessionals. For context, during the season premiere of The Kardashians, "" Feel Like the Old Days,"" Kourtney made a snide remark about her sisters wearing corsets and tall heels while playing with their children. She suggested that she is way more comfortable in Travis Barker-esque casual clothes and made it clear she thought her sisters were silly for thinking otherwise. Ultimately, Khloé and Kim clocked the dig against them immediately, and Kim decided to share the following comments in her confessional: Good for you babe. I don’t come in and say like ‘Huh, I would never give up on life so soon.' You know, saying the opposite. It’s the passive aggressive for me. Considering Kim Kardashian said that in a confessional, Kourtney didn’t hear the ""giving up on life"" remark until the episode aired. Sometime later, a source spoke with Entertainment Tonight, telling the outlet that Kourtney was not happy after the seventh season of The Kardashians premiere. When it comes to the mother of four's alleged feelings on the matter, the source tells ET: Kourtney's been a little upset with Kim and Khloé since the new season of 'The Kardashians' started airing. She didn't know Kim made that 'giving up on life' remark and she felt really bothered by it. While the Kardashian sisters are known for bickering quite a bit, which has been showcased over the 20+ seasons of their various reality shows, things between Kourtney's relationship with the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner family has allegedly been fraught over the last few years. Kourtney and Kim especially have been at odds with each other. Everything seemed to escalate after they had a major blow-up in 2018 when Kim called Kourtney the “least exciting to look at.” Oh Man, Was Scott Disick Trolling Kim Kardashian Over Her Viral Comments About Not Knowing The Cost Of Milk? Later in 2022 when Kim Kardashian worked with Dolce and Gabbana, Kourney became upset, saying that Kim was copying her wedding style. They eventually reconciled but, since then, Kourtney has made comments about her sisters’ business strategies in general and has been critical of their value systems. Such sentiments would seemingly indicate that this conflict runs a lot deeper than a Dolce and Gabbana campaign. This repeated negative energy between the two Kardashians has allegedly caused Kourtney to distance herself from the rest of her family. As a result, she's opted out of a lot of family occasions in favor of spending more time with her husband, Travis Barker, and their immediate family. This also has been a point of contention, which may or may not be linked to the comments Khloé and Kim made about their sister. This tension feels like a through line for this upcoming season, and I’m thinking these outfit comments will could set the stage for what's to come in upcoming episodes. Hulu: 30-Day Free TrialBoth Hulu's Ad-Supported and Ad-Free tiers give subscribers access to various shows, including The Kardashians.

"Two arrested after multiple people stabbed on train, police say","British Transport Police said they were responding to an incident on a train to Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. Two people have been arrested after a number of people were stabbed on a train to a Cambridgeshire town, police have said. Cambridgeshire Constabulary said armed police attended after officers were called to the scene at Huntingdon station at 7.39pm on Saturday. The Prime Minister said the incident was “deeply concerning” and urged people to follow police advice. In a statement on X, Sir Keir Starmer said: “The appalling incident on a train near Huntingdon is deeply concerning. “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. “Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police.” Video footage on social media showed scores of blue-light police cars and emergency vehicles in a station car park, and a team of armed police running towards the stationary train at Huntingdon station. Witnesses described seeing a man with a large knife, and passengers hiding in the toilets to escape the rampage, The Times reported. One witness told the paper there was “blood everywhere” and people were getting “stamped” on by others as they tried to flee. “I heard some people shouting we love (you),” the witness said. In their statement, British Transport Police said on X: “We are currently responding to an incident on a train to Huntingdon where multiple people have been stabbed. “Officers are in attendance alongside @CambsCops and two people have been arrested.” The attack is understood to have started shortly after the LNER train left Peterborough station. In a statement on Facebook, Cambridgeshire Constabulary said: “We were called at 7.39pm with reports that multiple people had been stabbed on a train. “Armed officers attended and the train was stopped at Huntingdon, where two men were arrested. A number of people have been taken to hospital. “The incident remains ongoing and the A1307 has been closed as you approach the town centre.” Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened” to hear of the stabbings and added: “I urge people to avoid comment and speculation at this early stage.” Huntingdon Station is closed, National Rail said, with all lines blocked. London North Eastern Railway (LNER), which operates East Coast Mainline services in the UK, confirmed the incident had happened on one of its trains and has urged passengers not to travel because of “major disruption”. In a statement on X at 9.21pm, LNER said: “We are experiencing major disruption across the LNER route. Emergency services are dealing with an incident at Huntingdon station, all lines are blocked. “Our advice is ‘Do Not Travel’. Please defer your travel where you can.” Cambridgeshire Constabulary urged anyone with information about the incident to report it online at quoting incident 495 of November 1, or by calling 101.",2025-11-01 21:16:50,Shropshire Star

He is also a co-founder and a commissioning editor at Hypatia Press, a publisher that specializes in philosophical works that challenge religion or spirituality. Donald Trump on Saturday threatened military action on foreign soil, escalating previous remarks about the nation. The president previously raised the possibility of sanctions against Nigeria for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians in what Trump now calls a ""disgraced country."" Nigerian officials have forcefully denied all the allegations. Trump went even further over the weekend, specifically threatening to use a military solution to what he considers to be a problem with persecution. ""If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing,' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,"" Trump said on Truth Social Saturday.

Youth Growth and Empowerment,"In this great walk of life, the things that the youth of the nation need to know are in dire need of their grooming and learning in the digital era. Well-groomed young minds equipped with training represent one of the most prominent and powerful assets for any nation. Across the world, there are more than 1.2 billion youth aged 15 to 24. In our beloved country, there is more than 60% of the population under the age of 30, which makes Pakistan the youngest nation in South Asia. Strong, academically and skilful youth of any nation potentially drive the economic growth, innovation, and social transformation. If the young minds are equipped with quality education, skill sets, mental well-being, and have the aptitudes towards social welfare services and the well-being of the people, then the nations can be proud of such individuals. The youth having such traits are capable of leading Pakistan in the true spirit. Their potential, innovation and creativity, patriotism, and resilience approach are the signs of hope. The key areas of learning for the young minds are as follows: Contemplation and pondering: In this technological era, the young minds need to know that they have only one chance at this thing called life. Gratitude in life is the most important thing to focus on what they have and not what they lack. The successful people in this world are not much smarter than the youth of this current era; whatever the great people have built, they have built dreams that changed the world. The difference was not brilliance and luck; it was just courage, bravery, and the initiatives they have taken. The comfort of their life might feel safe, but this would never lead them where they were meant to go. Sometimes, you have to lose the map and find yourself Nurturing the Young Minds: Nurturing the youth in terms of academic, social, and spiritual levels is the need of the present era that leads them towards empowerment, confidence, and motivates them to thrive in an evolving technological world. The youth of the great nation must be spiritually grounded, morally upright, and intellectually curious, guided by a strong sense of purpose. The young minds of the nation must be equipped with digital skills, innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship. Belief in Yourself: Youth must believe in their abilities and the unfolding vision. Sometimes, you have to lose the map and find yourself. The belief that no one has a vision like yours would be your superpower. You must fall in love with the process you are going through -the messy, uncertain, unglamorous middle. No one is clapping, except for you, who believes the great story still matters. Constant Struggle: Growth and empowerment a constant struggle and process that requires high willpower, commitment, dedication, and commitment by the youth. In addition, there is a need to focus on spiritual, academic, mental well-being, and social growth. Self-actualisation: The youth of Pakistan must realise that they are not the leader of tomorrow; they have the potential and strength of today. They have to build their dreams brick by fragile brick, even when they are facing frightful obstacles in their way. They have to be courageous and understand that the applause fades, but meaning lasts. They have to walk away from the places, people, and even versions of themselves that no longer fit. Sound Character: The young minds believe in their power and ability to shape the world. They must learn something and invest in their character, because true success and grace do not lie in talent, but in integrity, honesty, discipline, moral strength, and consistency. They must serve with compassion, which is the highest form of leadership to serve others. Big Dreams: Young minds must have big dreams and high willpower to achieve great success. They must realise that they are brave enough to dream big and achieve big. In addition, they must rise with unity, as it is said; united we rise, divided we fall. They must give the values to the unity instead of their belief, background, and identity; they can overcome any frightful obstacles and challenges in achieving their dreams. Responsibilities of Top Stakeholders: The top stakeholders of the country must unlock the potential of the young minds. They must consider them the true assets of the beloved country. The youth can be emerging as leaders, innovators, and change makers who are truly proud of their land, heritage, confident in their abilities, and rooted in values of compassion and empathy. Moon and Eagle: May the youth of our beloved country always shine brightly like a moon, and fly high like an eagle, as this bird has great traits and lives mostly in the air, stay at the peak of the mountains, and remain always in struggle and high grace. The great poet of the subcontinent, Allama Iqbal, used the word Shaheen symbolically for this king of the bird. May the young minds grow well, rock well, shine, and live with high grace.

Lincoln's Raley Cochran finishes as state runner up,"Raley Cochran maintains her pace. Ona, W.Va. — A year after Lincoln’s Raley Cochran finished 11th at the state meet, it was her goal to finish even higher. Her strategy was simple. “My strategy was to not let anybody get too far away from me and kick it in at the end, see who I could get,” Cochran said. And she accomplished that, as she was the Class AA state runner-up (20:21.39) at the 2025 WVSACC State Cross Country Championships on Saturday at Cabell Midland. “It feels pretty great,” Cochran said. “I’ve been working at this a long time, so I just feel great. It’s great to finish that high.” Cochran was the leader after the first mile, and although she entered the Cabell Midland High School track — the final stretch of the race — in fourth place, she passed two more runners to place second. “To know Raley basically since she was born and how hard she works at everything, she has certainly put the work in, so as a sophomore to be the state runner up is quite an accomplishment for her and certainly says a lot to her work ethic and her family who supported her and her team who has supported her,” Lincoln coach Kevin Nuzum said. “We’re real proud of Raley and all of the girls, the whole team, today.” She was joined in the top 10 by one of her teammates, Adalynn Milnes, a freshman, who placed seventh in 21:06.53, a second or two away from her personal-best time. She’s the lone freshman on the girls team, and her top-10 finish is the first from a freshman in school history at the state meet. “It was very exciting,” Milnes said. “I was excited to make it there because there’s no other freshmen on the team, and I’m the No. 2 runner.” Cochran and Milnes and others helped the Lincoln girls cross country team finish third. They had the same score (71) as Braxton County, but the tie breaker went to the Eagles since their final runner finished higher than Lincoln’s. Buffalo placed fourth (84) and Williamstown placed fifth (114). Also placing in the top 20 and earning a medal was Doddridge County’s Kaitlyn Key, who placed 11th (21:41.84). A senior, it wasn’t her personal-best time overall, but it was her best time on this course. “I wanted to start off strong,” Key said. “I feel like I do best when I get out ahead and get out of the park. Once I got down the hill, I had a little less than a mile and I just gave it everything I got, started to kick off girls one by one.” Key was one of two Doddridge County girls who qualified for the state meet, as Emily Cottrill also medaled with her 20th-place finish (22:42.39). Also, Philip Barbour’s Kayla Baker, in her final high school cross country race, placed 15th (22:22.920, South Harrison’s Savannah Holden finished 22nd (22:53.04) and Zoe Kirksey finished 48th (25:00.81). Boys The Doddridge County boys cross country team won the Class AA championship as a team as they placed first with an overall team score of 60. Lincoln was the state runner-up with an overall score of 71. The rest of the top five included Frankfort (90), Tyler Consolidated (fourth, 123) and Williamstown (fifth, 131). “It’s nice, it’s nice,” Doddridge County coach Josh Weekley said. “We had one on the girls side that we should’ve gotten a couple of years ago and didn’t, so getting this one on the boys, we knew coming in that we should, but you always have to do it on the course and they did exactly like they’ve done all year long. They all placed right around where we thought they should, a couple of them even elevated. They did what they needed to do, they went out and performed.” Amos Kimble of Tyler Consolidated won the Class AA boys state championship in 16:32.76. The state runner-up was Frankfort’s Gavin McDonald (16:51.52), and his teammate, Eric Alexander, placed third (17:11.30). Tyler Consolidated’s Tyler Moore placed fifth. Carter Sias was the Bulldogs’ top finisher on the boys side as he placed fourth in 17:19.90. It tied his best finish from his freshman year when he also placed fourth. “I’m very happy with that,” Sias said. “It definitely brings a lot of joy that I was able to do that my senior year. I think I’m more focused on seeing if the team gets a title, because I love my team a lot and I would love a title with them. I think that’s what I’m paying attention to more with them.” Sias also finished ahead of another local runner who had placed often beaten throughout the season, most often by 15 or more seconds. “I had him (Sias) down for fifth, I figured that was probably where he’d end up because Travis Moore from Tyler Consolidated had beaten him (by) 15-20 seconds all year long,” Weekley said. “Boy, he really stepped up and ran a good one. He was in third there for a while, but held on to the fourth spot. It’s big, he was five spots ahead of Lincoln’s No. 1 guy. Samuel (Gola) was five spots ahead of Lincoln’s No. 2 guy, that’s 10 points right there. The best I can tell, we won by 11, 10 of it is right there on those front two guys, so that’s a great race by Samuel to race seventh, get on the podium.” Nearly all of the Bulldogs medaled, as Samuel Gola placed seventh (17:54.73), Cory Swentzel placed 14th (18:17.37), Colton Key placed 17th (18:23.63) and Noah Bodkin finished 18th (18:27.74). Last year, Gola placed in the low 30s as a freshman and 17th as a sophomore, and while Saturday’s race wasn’t his personal-best time overall, it was his personal-best time on the state course and finish at the state event. “It felt great to finally get in the top 10,” Gola said. “I’ve never been so happy. I’ve worked so hard for it, and I’m really happy that I was finally able to get it.” Also finishing for the Bulldogs was Jacob Berke (50th, 20:06.68) and Cayleb Amos (51st, 20:09.10). For Lincoln, Adrian Bott placed ninth (18:05.56) in the final race of his high school career, all despite slipping a little bit out of the gates. It was an improvement over his 21st-place finish last year, and he is the first Lincoln boy to earn first-team all-state honors at the state meet. ”It felt good,” Bott said. “I definitely wanted to go faster, get a better place, but I didn’t start good enough.” Lincoln had four runners earn a medal. Aiden Byers placed 12th (18:16.51), Max Myers placed 13th (18:16.59) and Carter Knight placed 15th (18:21.38). “I’m just real proud of our team,” Nuzum said. “I thought did great. For a program that we’ve been building that I’ve coached for 16 years, to make it to states for both teams, and to do as well as we did, everyone wants to win, but I’ll take state runner-up. And with these young girls being third, they’re going to get there, so I’m real proud of this team. We’ve stayed healthy, we’ve stayed focused, we’ve stayed together, and I’m real proud of them.” Others who ran for the Cougars on Saturday include Seth Nay (24th, 18:53.34), Jonathon Folmsbee (25th, 18:54.35) and Dennis Napper (68th, 20:48.73). In a year where it was Lincoln’s first year for both teams to qualify for the state meet, having the whole teams at the event made it even better, Myers said. “It was the best experience of my life,” Myers said. “I love my entire team. We have four or five Liberty transfers, and we came together like family all year long with one goal of getting to states and doing the best we can.” Also, Philip Barbour’s Jacob Burner placed 19th (18:33.53), South Harrison’s Brennen Myers finished 32nd (19:20.06) and Nathaniel Linger placed 46th (20:01.33).

Scotland thrashes 85-0,"Darcy Graham and Duhan van der Merwe continued their personal battle to top Scotland's try-scoring charts as they ran in several scores during an 85-0, 13-try, rout of the United States at Murrayfield on Saturday. Scotland were without several first-choice players for their Autumn Nations Series opener, including Sione Tuipulotu, Finn Russell, Blair Kinghorn, Zander Fagerson, and Pierre Schoeman. But they were still far too strong for the United States, a tier two rugby union nation, ahead of next week's far sterner challenge at home to New Zealand, with Scotland yet to beat the All Blacks in 32 matches spanning 117 years of Tests between the two countries. ""Straight away, the players were very cohesive which is hard to achieve in a week's training, with a brand new team."" Scotland coach Gregor Townsend told the BBC. Looking ahead to the clash with New Zealand, the former Scotland playmaker added: ""It's a huge match. This game has been sold out for a while. Everyone loves watching the All Blacks. ""We've had two cracking matches against them (22-17 and 31-23 home defeats in 2017 and 2022) but not delivered that winning performance. ""There's no reason why we can't (beat New Zealand). The guys will be up for it and have the belief they can do it."" South Africa-born Van der Merwe marked his 50th cap with a double to take his Scotland tally to 34 tries, but fellow Edinburgh wing Graham moved level with him as the Dark Blues' highest try-scorer of all time with a hat-trick. The writing was on the wall for the Eagles as early as the fifth minute when Dylan Richardson went over from close range. And two minutes later, 21-year-old debutant back-row Liam McConnell's run up the left was followed by a basketball pass to set up Van der Merwe. Graham scored Scotland's third try before Van der Merwe grabbed his second of the match, with Scotland 45-0 ahead at half-time in an utterly lopsided contest. The rout continued after the break, with Graham completing his hat-trick four minutes into the second half after an exchange of passes with Ollie Smith.

"Pedestrian killed in hit-and-run near Midtown, Anchorage police say","Nov. 1—A pedestrian was killed by a suspected intoxicated driver in a hit-and-run collision on Thursday night, the Anchorage Police Department said. Anchorage police officers and Anchorage Fire Department medics were called to the area of Fireweed Lane and D Street at about 9:35 p.m., police said in an online statement. An SUV driven by someone later identified as 61-year-old John Ivory had collided with a pedestrian, police said. Online court records indicated that Ivory was charged with driving under the influence, a Class A misdemeanor. The pedestrian had been trying to cross Fireweed Lane west of Eide Street outside of a crosswalk when they were hit by Ivory's eastbound SUV, according to police. The pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene after life-saving measures were attempted, police said. Ivory left the scene but was arrested ""a short time later"" on suspicion of driving under the influence, according to police. Police reviewed traffic camera footage and tracked the SUV's movements before and after striking the female pedestrian, including a stretch where the vehicle was driven the wrong way down Northern Lights Boulevard, according to information from police included in charging documents signed by Assistant District Attorney Ashley D. McGraw. Traffic camera footage showed the vehicle being parked at the Walmart on A Street, where police located and apprehended the defendant, according to the charging documents. ""Clues"" during field testing led to officers' suspicions of the driver's impairment, while a breath sample was negative for alcohol, the charges said. The collision closed the westbound lanes of Fireweed Lane at D Street until about 3:30 a.m. Friday, police said. Police said Friday morning that the victim will be identified after next-of-kin notification procedures are complete.",2025-11-01 22:11:00,Yahoo! News
King Charles and Queen Camilla's huge move amid Andrew's title drama,"King Charles and Queen Camilla have made a charitable donation to the people of Jamaica after damage caused by Hurricane Melissa﻿ this week. It was reported that after the monarch shared a statement on how ﻿""deeply concerned"" he was over the weather event, he and his wife made a private donation to the Red Cross for the relief efforts in affected countries. Chief executive of the British Red Cross Beatrice Butsana-Sita said: ""King Charles and Queen Camilla's donation will help the IFRC network continue its lifesaving work, particularly in Jamaica, such as through search and rescue and ensuring people have access to healthcare, safe shelter, clean water, food and other essential supplies."" Secretary General of the IFRC Jagan Chapagain added, ""We are very grateful for this donation and hope it will encourage others to donate, too. Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica hard. Our emergency appeal is essential to raise the funds needed to help people rebuild their lives over the months and years to come."" The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) is currently engaging volunteers to distribute emergency supplies and manage shelters in Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and is now preparing for the Bahamas as the storm heads north. The UK government has also pledged to match up to £1 million (approx. $2 million) in public donations for aid.

Staff and parents voice concerns over proposed Anchorage school closures,"Nov. 1—The Anchorage School District this week heard criticism from parents and staff from two elementary schools it proposes to close next school year. Many questioned whether closing schools would increase class sizes, and took issue with the repeated disruption of programs for special education students. Anchorage School Board members are weeks away from voting on the proposed closures, but say they still want feedback from the community. A survey is available on the district website, and another ""community conversation"" is planned for Saturday at the district office building from noon to 2 p.m. If school board members vote to approve the plan, charter schools would move into the vacated Fire Lake and Lake Otis elementary buildings. The board will discuss the school closures proposed by district administrators for the first time Tuesday, and take a final vote on Nov. 18. One board member, Pat Higgins, attended two district events this week to hear from parents and staff and said he doesn't support the current plan, though he said he did support district efforts to add child care to vacant classrooms. ""They feel strongly that it's going to hurt the kids, and it's not good for the community, and they oppose it. That's what I heard,"" Higgins said. ""I'm not a big supporter of closing these schools. I don't think the benefits outweigh the adverse impact it has on the community and the involvement with the family."" District officials have argued that fewer school buildings are needed to serve a dwindling population of students. Compared to 2010, nearly 7,500 fewer students now attend neighborhood schools in the district. During that same time, the district has closed five schools. Deputy Chief of Schools Kersten Johnson-Struempler said underutilized schools are more susceptible to issues when one teacher has to call out sick, and closing schools will reduce the number of mixed-grade classrooms throughout the district. She told Lake Otis families who filed into the Bettye Davis East cafeteria on Wednesday that the plan attempts to use resources more efficiently by concentrating them at a smaller number of school buildings. [Alaska educators call for more school funding in second task force meeting] ""We are looking at low utilization rates. The reason we're here, unfortunately, is partially budget-related, but partially enrollment decline,"" Johnson-Struempler said. ""We as a district really do have to consider what is our utilization rate, how are we using our money as a district most effectively, and so that's a factor."" Special education concerns Lake Otis Elementary staff and parents questioned the district's plan to relocate students in special education classes. The distribution of Lake Otis students to other schools will also have a ripple effect on those programs. To make room for general education students moving from Lake Otis to Kasuun Elementary, students in the School Based Behavioral Supports program at Kasuun would relocate to Ocean View Elementary under the current plan. Kasuun special education behavior coach Chandra Binion is concerned that the sensory deprivation room at Kasuun may not be available for students who need it if they relocate to Ocean View. ""We have some students who came to us from Lake Hood after it closed. If we are moved to Ocean View, this will be their third location in three years. Our kids in our program thrive on consistency, stability, and that's what they need and this move feels like it's taking that away from them,"" Binion said. ""We deal with students who are often in crisis, and you can't keep moving them around like that if we want them to be successful."" During Johnson-Struempler's presentation detailing where special education students would be moved, she also noted the importance of routine for special education students. ""We do want to really pay attention for all students to the number of transitions they have, but particularly for our special education students in special programs,"" she said. ""Having consistency and limiting the transitions is something we really look at."" Jacqui Higgins, who chairs the district's Special Education Advisory Committee, said her child has made significant progress with their Life Skills teacher at Lake Otis. ""We spent a long time building this community, and I think it is unacceptable that the Anchorage School District thinks that it is OK to be so transient with their special education students,"" Higgins said. Higgins is worried that her child might regress next school year without familiar teachers. Higgins is also concerned about the impacts on her child of a longer bus ride with more students. Despite her reservations, she doesn't oppose the district's right-sizing effort altogether. ""I'm OK with right-sizing. We are losing people, our infrastructure is not built the way it used to be,"" Higgins said. At a school board meeting last week, Fire Lake parents also voiced concerns about special education programs. Special education students in the school's resource and structured learning classroom programs would relocate to Birchwood ABC school. Students in the Life Skills program at Birchwood would move to Alpenglow Elementary. ""There's a true family built around that entire SPED program. Those children belong in a way that I can't imagine replicated in another facility,"" parent Arielle Van Vleet said. Binion, the Kasuun special education teacher, said she hadn't heard satisfactory answers about her concerns after speaking with several board members and district staff Wednesday. ""It's all kind of on how the board votes. We're very, very concerned,"" Binion said. More feedback In addition to the meeting Wednesday, board member Kelly Lessens said she attended meetings this week with Indigenous, multicultural and special education advisory committees, as well as some middle school parents. Lessens heard several parents asking if school closures would increase class sizes at the schools receiving those students. Lessens said that's a misconception. ""It's not correct for people to say that school consolidations are going to increase their class sizes,"" Lessens said. ""What is true is that insufficient funds for supporting and maintaining public education are responsible for increased class sizes."" For Fire Lake, one topic that parents also bring up is a nearby housing development currently under construction, which will add more than 100 homes to the neighborhood. District officials have said the development is not likely to significantly affect the projected enrollment. Fire Lake was initially included in the list of schools planned for closure last year, but board members voted to remove it from consideration. ""We went through this last year, and every reason remains the same for why Fire Lake should remain open, and I cannot for the life of me understand how we're back here when nothing has changed. The only thing that has changed is that the development being built is further along than it was a year ago,"" Fire Lake parent Van Vleet said. Board members encouraged residents to continue voicing their concerns to the district. Families and other community members can take the district survey or testify at board meetings on Nov. 4 and Nov. 18. Board member Andy Holleman said he's typically accustomed to hearing complaints from parents when the district asks for feedback, but this week was different. ""When you go to these, people stand up and talk about how wonderful this school is and how it's the only place that really gets their kid, and they're not going to be able to do as well anywhere else,"" Holleman said, ""which is how we want everybody to feel about their schools. But at the same time, we just have too many buildings for the number of kids we're serving and this is going to be a tough choice.""",2025-11-01 22:11:00,Yahoo! News

"Hamlin snatches Phoenix pole with Byron, Larson hot on his heels","James Gilbert/Getty Images ShareThis is disabled until you accept Social Networking cookies. Denny Hamlin will begin his NASCAR Cup Series championship quest from the pole Sunday afternoon at Phoenix Raceway. Hamlin topped the board in the final qualifying session of the 2025 season with a lap of 133.759mph (26.914s) – his fifth pole of the year and fourth at Phoenix. “We’re trying; we’re doing everything we can,” he said of winning the championship. “I’m really proud of this whole Progressive Toyota team. We’ve worked hard on it. We’ve really been working hard, and hopefully we get the payoff tomorrow.” William Byron and Kyle Larson, two of the three other Cup Series title contenders, qualified second and third. Byron clocked in at 133.551mph; Larson’s fast lap was 133.437mph. Austin Cindric qualified fourth at 133.249mph, Ryan Blaney fifth at 133.190mph, Carson Hocevar sixth at 133.141mph, Josh Berry seventh at 132.876mph, Alex Bowman eighth at 132.871mph, Chris Buescher ninth at 132.787mph and Joey Logano tenth at 132.748mph.

It will follow the order of qualifying, with Hamlin’s team picking their stall first, followed by Byron, Larson and Briscoe. “We’re obviously going to be in a great starting spot there at this point,” Hamlin said. “Then we have to make sure we do all the right things, and that’s execute the entire day. Largely, that’s going to rest on my shoulders, so I’ll do the best I can.” AJ Allmendinger was the only driver who did not post a qualifying time.

"Two arrested after multiple people stabbed on UK train, police say","Police operate near the scene after a series of stabbings on a train near Cambridge, Britain, November 1, 2025, in this screengrab from video obtained from social media. JAMIE SHAND/via REUTERS LONDON (Reuters) -Nine people were treated for life-threatening injuries after a series of stabbings on a train near Cambridge in eastern England on Saturday, and two men were arrested in what Prime Minister Keir Starmer called an ""appalling incident."" British Transport Police said counterterrorism police were supporting its investigation whilst it works to establish the full circumstances and motivation for the incident. “We’re conducting urgent enquiries to establish what has happened, and it could take some time before we are in a position to confirm anything further,"" British Transport Police Chief Superintendent Chris Casey said. ""At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident."" Cambridgeshire police said they were called at 1939 GMT after reports that multiple people had been stabbed on the 1825 service from Doncaster in northern England to London King's Cross. The train stopped at Huntingdon, with armed officers seen entering the train in videos on social media. ""Armed officers attended and the train was stopped at Huntingdon, where two men were arrested,"" the police said. One eyewitness told Sky News that one of the suspects, waving a large knife, was tasered by police. The East of England Ambulance Service said it mobilised a large-scale response to Huntingdon Railway Station, which included numerous ambulances and critical care teams, including three air ambulances. Starmer posted on X that the incident was ""deeply concerning."" ""My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response,"" he said.

Ireland crumble after the break as ruthless All Blacks turn the screw,"This time, Chicago was not Ireland’s kind of town. Unlike 2016, when they made history and transformed this fixture from a one-sided slaughter into a genuine rivalry, Ireland didn’t get things their own way. They had their moments, for sure. In fact, they even survived 20 minutes with a numerical disadvantage in the first half, holding the lead up until the hour mark. And then came that familiar meltdown which had characterised the first 111 years of this fixture. As New Zealand clicked up through the gears, Ireland went into reverse. First came a try from Tamaiti Williams on 61 minutes — New Zealand opting for a tap and go when a more conservative team might have kicked for the posts. That edged them a point in front. But they were only getting started. Next, on 67 minutes, came Wallace Sititi’s score — a superb flowing move from New Zealand’s perspective, a defensive disaster from Ireland’s. Garry Ringrose was exposed, Beauden Barrett and Damian McKenzie were brilliant, and Sititi finished off the move to make it 21–13 to New Zealand. And then, three minutes from the end, scrum-half Cam Roigard slalomed his way through a forest of Irish defenders to put the game beyond reach. Who would have thought that possible at half-time? Because at that stage, Ireland were ahead. Given they had played much of the first half with just 14 players, it was a superb opening 40 minutes. There were flaws — Jack Crowley overhitting several kicks, Dan Sheehan miscuing a few throws — but few teams ever dictate terms against New Zealand. Ireland did in that first period. For starters, there was a seventh-minute penalty from Crowley to make it 3–0. Ten minutes later came an inspired call by captain Dan Sheehan to go for the corner rather than the posts. Fortune favoured the brave. Sheehan, Ryan Baird, Sheehan again, then Jamison Gibson-Park and Stuart McCloskey combined to set up Tadhg Furlong, who barged across from close range. Try, Ireland. Crowley converted, and the lead stretched to 10–0. It didn’t last long. Will Jordan reminded everyone why “Jordan” is a name that resonates in Chicago. The New Zealand full-back swept through the Irish midfield on 19 minutes, and by the time the cover defence scrambled back, the ball was zipped right for Ardie Savea to touch down. Beauden Barrett converted. 10–7. It stayed that way until half-time. With James Ryan off for a HIA and Tadhg Beirne gone for the rest of the game, Ireland had neither of their starting locks on the field by the break. You could say they were stuck between a lock and a hard place. And yet, they still led. Pre-match, the PA man had played a Phil Collins song to gee everyone up. Then, against all odds, Ireland led New Zealand at the break. But after losing here in 2016, all New Zealand wanted was one more night in Soldier Field. They got it here — and they got a performance, too. By the second half, their scrum had solidified, their aerial game steadied, and their handling sharpened. Those three second-half tries owed everything to their ability to execute when it mattered. Few teams in the world can do that. Ireland, in 2022 and 2023, were one of those teams at that level. Now, they are not. This was proof — a team in transition, still missing Johnny Sexton, with neither Crowley nor Sam Prendergast quite there yet. In the end, they ran out of steam. Those 20 minutes without Tadhg Beirne, sent off for a high tackle on Beauden Barrett, proved crucial. Playing New Zealand is tough enough when it’s 15 versus 15. Make it 15 versus 14, even for 20 minutes, and you will suffer. It took a while for that disadvantage to catch up with Ireland. But it did. The All Blacks played like all backs — their handling slick, Ireland’s less so. Chicago belongs to them this time.",2025-11-01 22:31:00,Irish Mirror

Published On 1 Nov 20251 Nov 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Liverpool finally halted their dreadful losing run with a 2-0 Premier League victory over Aston Villa on Saturday to climb into third place in the table, as Mohamed Salah became the third player in Reds history to score 250 goals. Under mounting pressure after four successive league losses – and six in their last seven games across all competitions – Arne Slot’s men climbed to within seven points of league leaders Arsenal, with 18 points. Villa fell to 11th in the table on 15 points. list of 4 itemsend of list Salah struck in first-half injury time, capitalising on a huge blunder from Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who played the ball right into the path of Liverpool’s talisman. Salah finished first time to the relief of the anxious Anfield crowd, and joined Roger Hunt and Ian Rush as the only players to score 250 goals for the Merseyside club. Ryan Gravenberch doubled the home side’s lead in the 58th minute when he blasted a shot from the top of the box that deflected off Pau Torres and in, past Martinez. A stunning volley from Amad Diallo earned Manchester United a battling 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Saturday. Looking to continue their revival under Ruben Amorim, United appeared to be on their way to securing a fourth successive league victory after Brazilian veteran Casemiro headed them into a 34th-minute lead. United, however, capitulated early in the second half, when two goals in less than two minutes from Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona helped Forest to turn the match on its head. The visitors responded well, but were frustrated in their efforts to restore parity until Diallo unleashed a blistering strike from the edge of the penalty area nine minutes from time to secure a point for Amorim’s side. Diallo almost snatched victory at the death, as United missed the chance to climb up to second in the standings with a win, the point helping them to move into fifth in the standings, above rivals Manchester City, who play on Sunday.

Arsenal moved seven points clear at the top of the Premier League with a straightforward 2-0 victory over Burnley at Turf Moor, as their mastery of set pieces again proved irresistible.

Arsenal were in cruise control in the 35th minute, this time from open play, as a sweeping counterattack ended with Rice thumping a header past Burnley goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. Burnley did not manage a goal attempt in the first half, and while they offered more of a threat after the break, Arsenal eased to a seventh consecutive clean sheet in all competitions.

"NYT Pips Hints, Walkthrough And Solutions For Sunday, November 2","ByErik Kain, Senior Contributor. If you’re looking for help with today’s NYT Pips puzzle, look no further! Below, you’ll find the solutions for the Easy and Medium-tier Pips and a full walkthrough for the Hard Pips. It’s another beautiful day in November, so be sure to get out there and enjoy it before chillier weather descends. Winter is coming. Let’s solve this Pips! Looking for Friday’s Pips? Read our guide right here. In Pips, you have a grid of multicolored boxes. Each colored area represents a different “condition” that you have to achieve. You have a select number of dominoes that you have to spend filling in the grid. You must use every domino and achieve every condition properly to win. There are Easy, Medium and Difficult tiers. Here’s an example of a difficult tier Pips: As you can see, the grid has a bunch of symbols and numbers with each color. On the far left, the three purple squares must not equal one another (hence the equal sign crossed out). The two pink squares next to that must equal a total of 0. The zig-zagging blue squares all must equal one another. You click on dominoes to rotate them, and will need to since they have to be rotated to fit where they belong. Not shown on this grid are other conditions, such as “less than” or “greater than.” If there are multiple tiles with > or 4 into Green 12 and the 6/0 domino from Green 12 into Pink 0. Next, I placed the 0/5 domino from Pink 0 into Orange 10. I finished up the Pink 0 group with the 0/1 domino into Blue = and placed it horizontally, since you can tell you need to leave the space above empty. Next, I placed the 0/3 domino from Purple 0 into Dark Blue 6 and the 3/1 domino from Dark Blue 6 into the big Blue = group. Then I placed the 5/1 domino from Orange 10 up into Blue = and the 1/1 domino in the center of the Blue = group. Time for the remaining limbs. I placed the 6/4 domino from Blue > 4 into Purple 8 and the 4/2 domino from Purple 8 into the Dark Blue 2 tile. Then I placed the 3/2 domino from Orange 3 into Green 8 and the 6/1 tile from Green 8 into the Blue = group. With just the little man’s head remaining, I placed the 1/4 domino from Blue = into Pink 8 and the 0/4 domino from the Purple 0 tile into Pink 8. Now the happy dancing man is complete! This Pips was a lot more daunting than it was challenging. Lots of small total groups that could be solved different ways, but pretty obvious clues on where to go right off the bat. Starting where I did helped, I think, because it was pretty clear that the 6/0 would go into Pink 0 and the rest of that group led me straight to where I needed to go next. Still fun, just not nearly as hard as yesterday’s. Let me know if you solved this a different way on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook.

"Candidate in Columbus, Ohio, Declares, ' We Believe in Somalia' at Campaign Rally","As our own Doug Powers reported a couple of days ago, Omar Fateh, the mayoral candidate known as the ""Mamdani of Minneapolis,"" pledged his loyalty to the country … of Somalia. Fateh waved the Somali flag at a campaign rally and pledged loyalty to the country, despite the fact that he was born in Washington, D.C. Omar Fateh waves foreign flag, speaks a foreign language, pledges his loyalty to Somalia, tells Somalians to elect himThis is a rally in Minneapolis pic.twitter.com/uVP4k8TVcK It was a nice concession of Fateh to have an American flag behind him. We know that Minneapolis is Little Somalia, but it looks like Columbus, Ohio, is moving in the same direction. We're not sure why this woman is urging children who are too young to vote to get out and vote, but she assures them, ""We believe in Somalia."" The Associated Press just a couple of weeks ago published a feature about Somali Americans running for office. ""It’s a busy Friday afternoon at a Somali restaurant on the northeast side of Columbus, home to the second-largest Somali population in the United States. The smell of spices is just as robust as the loud conversation, and the East African restaurant is crowded after afternoon prayers at the nearby mosque."" ""WE BELIEVE IN SOMALIA"" This is a rally for a candidate in… Columbus, Ohio pic.twitter.com/nrninMBeSh The two little girls up front are even dressed as the Somali flag. “We believe in Somalia”.Awesome, then go back there and make your own country better. Invasions by invitation are a real issue I believe in Somalia so much I want it to have its missing Somalians back. I believe in sending them back there Then return to Somalia. Take Ilhan Omar with you. They do know where they are.. right? I believe in Somalians going back to Somalia Upon taking office, you have to swear that you hold no allegiance or loyalty to any other country but the United States.Which means this kind of rhetoric disqualifies them by default. Thought that was the Minnesota flag for a second It was just a couple of years ago that Minnesota changed its ""offensive"" state flag to one that looks a lot like the Somali flag. Coming soon to a town/city near you Matt Walsh posted a hard truth on Friday: We should have never allowed immigration from Somalia at all. It has not benefited this country in the slightest way. Now they are taking over once-proud American cities, and will turn them into the same kind of failed dysfunctional hellscape that they fled. Like they say, import the third world, become the third world. *** Editor’s Note: The Schumer Shutdown is here.

Disney Channels Vanish From YouTube TV After Contract Dispute,"YouTube TV subscribers — including thousands across North Texas — lost access to ESPN, ABC, National Geographic, and over a dozen other Disney-owned channels after the companies failed to reach a new distribution deal. The blackout, which began late Thursday, affects major sports coverage, including college football games on Saturday and upcoming NBA, NFL, and NHL contests. YouTube TV, the largest U.S. internet TV provider with more than 9 million subscribers, warned viewers of the dispute for weeks through on-screen messages. YouTube TV’s parent company, Google, said Disney demanded higher fees that would drive up prices for subscribers. In a blog post updated just before midnight, YouTube accused Disney of yanking its channels to steer viewers toward its own streaming services, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo. “We know this is a frustrating and disappointing outcome for our subscribers and we continue to urge Disney to work with us constructively to reach a fair agreement that restores their networks to YouTube TV,” the company said, the Associated Press reported. YouTube TV said it will credit subscribers $20 if Disney content stays dark for an extended period. The service’s base plan costs $82.99 per month. Disney countered that YouTube TV refused to “pay fair rates” and accused the company of “using its market dominance to eliminate competition,” according to Axios. “With a $3 trillion market cap, Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we’ve successfully negotiated with every other distributor,” Disney said in a statement, AP reported. Disney emphasized that major college football matchups — including several Top 25 teams — will be affected this weekend, adding that it hopes to reach a resolution quickly. The dispute marks the fourth major content standoff for YouTube TV since August. The service has faced similar threats from Fox Corp. and NBCUniversal and remains at an impasse with TelevisaUnivision. One reported sticking point involves whether Disney would allow YouTube TV to distribute its streaming content within the platform — a concession Disney has little incentive to grant as it builds its own services. YouTube is also considering a separate sports and broadcast package. Unlike traditional cable providers, virtual pay-TV services face fewer regulations — giving YouTube TV flexibility to push for cheaper, more modern streaming deals.",2025-11-01 22:30:50,Yahoo! News
Roast potatoes will be crispy every time when you add 1 thing at boiling stage,"Roast potatoes are a quintessential part of a traditional roast dinner. We Brits are mad about roast potatoes, and there's always a bit of a debate over the best recipe to get that perfect crispy exterior while keeping the inside fluffy. You might have been taught that potatoes should only ever be cooked in a specific type of fat, or you may firmly believe the way they're moved from boiling to roasting is crucial. The reality is, there are countless ways to roast a potato, and if your preferred method results in tasty spuds, then you're not doing anything wrong. However, if you're on the hunt for a foolproof way to ensure crispy potatoes every time, one culinary enthusiast on social media may just have the ideal trick. All you need to do is add one ingredient to the water during the boiling process. In an Instagram video, Oryan Levi revealed her secret tip for perfect roast potatoes. She mentioned her mates often ask her for the recipe, and she gets her perfect crisp by adding a common kitchen cupboard item to her boiling water. Oryan began by saying she was using baby potatoes instead of larger ones, and she halved them but left the skins on. This trick could still work with regular potatoes typically used for roasting, but the secret ingredient is intended to crisp up the skins so it might not be as effective on peeled potatoes. She then put them all into a pot and added some water, along with the secret ingredient - baking soda. She advised: ""A tablespoon of baking soda in the water is going to help make the skin super crispy."" Oryan then proceeded with the usual cooking process, removing the potatoes from the water once they were ""fork tender"". After draining them in a colander, she emphasised the ""most important part of the process"" was letting them sit in the colander for at least 10 minutes to allow all the excess water to evaporate. Next, Oryan seasoned the potatoes with garlic, salt, pepper, and oil, before spreading them out on a baking tray. She then positioned each potato cut side down and baked them in the oven for 15-20 minutes at 220°C - resulting in perfectly cooked and crispy potatoes. In the caption of her post, she wrote: ""My biggest tip with this recipe is to get to know your oven well. Does it run hot? Are there hot spots where food tends to get extra crispy? There's a delicate balance between perfectly golden and too far gone. The first time you make this, keep a close eye and check on your taters often to make sure they don't burn!"" 1. Choose the right potato:Go for starchy potatoes like Russets or Maris Piper. They crisp up better than waxy varieties. 2. Cut evenly:Cut your potatoes into similar-sized chunks so they cook evenly. Larger chunks give a fluffy inside; smaller ones get crispier. 3. Parboil First:Boil the potatoes in salted water for 7-10 minutes until just tender (they should be soft on the outside but not falling apart). This helps create a fluffy exterior. 4. Rough them up:Drain the potatoes and give them a good shake in the colander or pan to rough up the edges. These rough bits become extra crispy. 5. Preheat the fat:While the potatoes are parboiling, preheat your roasting pan with oil or fat (vegetable oil, duck/goose fat, or beef dripping) in a hot oven (220°C/425°F). Adding potatoes to hot fat ensures instant sizzle and crispiness. 6. Don't crowd the pan:Spread the potatoes out in a single layer with space between them. Overcrowding steams them instead of roasting. 7. Season well:Toss with salt, pepper, and any desired herbs (rosemary, thyme, garlic cloves) before roasting. 8. Roast and turn:Roast for 40-50 minutes, turning once or twice for even browning. Don't turn too often - let them crisp up! 9. Finish with a sprinkle:For extra crunch, sprinkle with a little coarse salt or a dusting of semolina/flour before roasting. 10. Serve immediately:Crispy potatoes are best served right out of the oven!",2025-11-02 08:04:00,Wales Online
Struggling With Dry Mouth? Here’s What Causes It Causes And Home Remedies To Relieve It Naturally,"Written by Muskan Gupta |Published : November 2, 2025 1:33 PM IST Dry mouth, also known as xerostomia, is more common than most people realise. It might be not only a slight pain in its essence but also indicate a health complication, say dentists. It occurs as a result of the inability of the salivary glands in your mouth to produce just enough saliva to keep your mouth moist. Salivation is important in the preservation of oral health, and the absence of salivation may cause a number of dental and health issues. Dry mouth refers to a condition that experiences an abnormally dry mouth because of lack of sufficient saliva. Saliva assists in cleaning the food particles as well as neutralising acids and bacteria. The mouth is susceptible to infections, cavities, and even bad breath when the level of saliva reduces. This condition is either a temporary one, as may happen upon intake of some drugs, or it may be chronic, as may be associated with health complications or interventions.

Dry mouth's common causes include: Dry mouth is hard to miss, in the event that you are aware of it. The common symptoms include: In case of these symptoms taking more than a few days, then it is worthy of visiting a dentist in order to have an evaluation. You may like to read There is always a shortage of saliva, which can cause severe problems with the mouth. Saliva plays key roles in the cleaning of food in the mouth and breaking down the acids that are produced by the bacteria. Lack of sufficient amounts of it leads to a higher rate of accumulated plaque that puts individuals at risk of tooth decay, gum disease and mouth infections. In extreme cases, it may also contribute to taste as well as render the use of dentures painful. See your dentist in case you always feel dry or you eat and speak with difficulty. Chronic dry mouth can be an indication of some underlying condition that requires medical intervention. One can avoid cavities by taking care of their mouth at an early age. TRENDING NOW Dry mouth might appear to be a minor takeaway, yet dentists say that this symptom should not be overlooked at all. The mouth requires a healthy flow of saliva; hence, one should listen to what the body is telling you.

IPL 2026 Trade Window: BIG TWIST Ahead of Auction! Sanju Samson and KL Rahul’s Trade Makes A Massive U-Turn – Know Full Details,"---Advertisement--- IPL 2026 Trade Window: The IPL 2026 trade window is already buzzing with speculation, and all eyes are on two of India’s top batsmen. Rumours are swirling that KL Rahul and Sanju Samson could be sporting new jerseys ahead of the upcoming season, potentially shaking up team dynamics across the league. Reports suggest that the Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals are close to finalizing a high-profile trade. If confirmed, Sanju Samson could move to Delhi in exchange for Tristan Stubbs. This swap would be among the biggest in recent IPL history, with Samson bringing leadership experience and consistent run-scoring to a Delhi lineup that is looking to strengthen its batting core. Delhi fans could see a significant boost if Samson dons their jersey in IPL 2026. 🚨 TRANSFER BOMBSHELL! 🚨Sanju Samson ➡️ Delhi Capitals on the cards ahead of IPL 2026 👀💥If this happens — it’s gonna shake the entire IPL trade window! 🔥#SanjuSamson #DelhiCapitals #IPL2026 #IPLRumours pic.twitter.com/C3BmBGXtEI Meanwhile, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are reportedly eyeing KL Rahul as they look to bounce back after a disappointing 2025 season. The Knight Riders are in need of a proven batter who can also take on leadership responsibilities. Rahul, who has captained Punjab and Lucknow, fits the bill perfectly. His strong relationship with KKR’s new coach, Abhishek Nayar, adds extra appeal for the franchise. However, KKR faces a tricky challenge. Building an attractive trade deal for Delhi won’t be easy. The Knight Riders are reluctant to part with key players like Rinku Singh or Angkrish Raghuvanshi, and veterans Andre Russell and Sunil Narine are untouchable. This limits their elite trade options, making the potential acquisition of Rahul a complex puzzle. 🚨 KKR WANTS KL RAHUL 🚨– KKR is desperate to have KL Rahul in their team but biggest question is that which player they will trade. [Sahil Malhotra from TOI] pic.twitter.com/8RoWLOgZOx Sources also indicate that KKR is preparing to make a big push for Cameron Green in the upcoming IPL auction. This suggests the franchise is planning a major rebuild around a fresh core of players. With both Rahul and Samson potentially on the move, the IPL 2026 trade window could dramatically alter team compositions, making the next season one of the most exciting yet. Fans can expect a period of intense speculation and high-stakes negotiations as franchises look to fine-tune their squads. The coming weeks could see some blockbuster deals that change the balance of power in the IPL.

India A fumble despite Pant’s 90; need 59 to win with 3 wickets in hand,"Join WhatsApp Folow Facebook Subscribe YouTube Follow Instagram Bengaluru: India A picked up from where they left off on Day 3 as Rishabh Pant and Ayush Badoni formed a calm and composed partnership to start the first session on Day 4 of the first unofficial Test here at the BCCI Centre of Excellence Ground 1. Earlier on Day 3, India A finished at 119-4 in 39 overs, needing 156 runs to win with six wickets in hand. Pant and Badoni stitched a 53-run stand before the visitors dismissed the in-form wicketkeeper-batter. Pant looked set on the crease as he took his previous day’s score of 64 not out to enter the nervous nineties. However, Tiaan van Vuuren struck in the 49th over to dismiss Pant on 90, thereby reducing the hosts to 172/5 in their chase of 275 runs. Badoni and Kotian then carried the game forward, but the former was dismissed, scoring a 47-ball 34, as van Vuuren struck again in the 53rd over, putting an end to their 23-run sixth-wicket stand. While Kotian looked to settle in quickly, a poor choice of shot led to him being caught at fine leg as Lutho Sipamla provided his side with another breakthrough, bringing the Indian side down to 215/7 in 89 overs. Also Read: The Third Eye: Implementation of legal reforms While the hosts managed to score a handful of runs in the first session, the visitors picked up three crucial wickets as the Rishabh Pant-led side now struggles in their run chase. In the 22 overs of the first session, India A scored 97 runs before the two sides walked off for lunch. Van Vuuren has been the pick of the bowlers for the Proteas, having picked up three wickets in his nine-over spell so far while conceding 40 runs. The hosts, currently at 216-7, now need 59 runs to win the first unofficial Test with just three wickets in hand.

"Tejashwi Confident Of Forming Next Govt In Bihar, Declares Swearing-In Date","ETV Bharat / state By PTI Published : November 2, 2025 at 1:33 PM IST Patna: INDIA bloc Chief Ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav on Sunday asserted that the opposition coalition was certain to form the next government in Bihar, and the swearing-in will take place four days after the results of assembly polls are declared. ""On November 14, the results of the Bihar assembly polls will be declared, and on November 18, swearing-in will take place"", the RJD leader told reporters here. He remarked while reacting to the arrest of Anant Singh, former Mokama MLA, who is in the fray as the candidate of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U). ""It was bound to happen, such a serious incident had taken place"", said Yadav, referring to the arrest of Singh, in connection with the killing of Dular Chand Yadav, who was supporting Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj Party in that area. The young leader added, ""Today, the Prime Minister is visiting Bihar. He should take note of the situation in the state where not a day passes without some heinous crime taking place. But this will change as soon as the Mahagathbandhan (the name by which INDIA bloc is known in Bihar) forms government"". ""On November 14, the results of assembly polls will be out, followed by swearing in on November 18. Between November 26 and January 26, which includes a month-long kharmaas period, Tejashwi will ensure that all criminals, irrespective of their caste and religion, are in jail and face the strictest possible action"", said Yadav. Former Union minister and BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy reacted with bemusement to Yadav's statement. ""So, he (Yadav) has made such an announcement. But I have learnt he has purchased tickets for a vacation abroad, learning that the people of Bihar are still reposing their trust in Nitish Kumar.

Central Catholic senior from Lowell named 2026 National Merit Scholarship Commended Student,"LAWRENCE — Central Catholic High School senior and Lowell resident Mason Crowley, Class of 2026, was recently named a semifinalist by the 2026 National Merit Scholarship Program. CCHS Principal Andrew Murray presented Mason with a letter of acknowledgement for his academic accomplishments. “The entire Central Catholic community is beyond proud of the academic success of Mason,” said Murray. “We are confident that he will move on to amazing accomplishments and make the CCHS legacy even stronger.” According to NMSC, about 16,000 entrants were named semifinalists — the highest-scoring entrants in each state. The students were notified through their schools and provided scholarship application materials explaining requirements to advance in the competition for National Merit Scholarships to be offered in 2027. In addition to academics, Mason — who wants to pursue a degree in engineering or computer science — participates in several activities including Track & Field, National Honor Society, Student Alumni Association, and Student Ambassador Association. Mason also makes time to serve others: “My favorite service event is the Student Alumni Association Christmas Wrapping event, because it’s a great opportunity for us as students to get together and to give to those in need. I have also helped with the TeamWalk for Cancer Care in Lowell, the Haverhill Golf Tournament, the Special Olympics Field Games, and mentoring at Saint Mary’s Church.” Mason believes all his CCHS teachers have been supportive, but he has specific faculty shout-outs including Sully Grella ’92 (math faculty/coach), Brian Griffin (science faculty), Eric Boucher ’04 (math faculty), Cameron Hebert ’17 (math faculty). “I feel that what makes Central Catholic so special is definitely the sense of community. Everyone makes such a sincere effort to welcome and understand each other, and it makes a huge difference,” said Mason. Mason’s sister Makayla Crowley ’29 and cousins Elena Zorbas ’27 and Luke Zorbas ’27 also attend CCHS.",2025-11-02 08:03:38,Lowellsun

AI song generator Udio offers brief window for downloads after Universal settlement upsets users,"Artificial intelligence song generation platform Udio said it would give its frustrated users 48 hours starting Monday to download their songs before the company shifts to a new business model to comply with a legal settlement. The short reprieve comes after Udio on Wednesday said it had settled copyright infringement claims brought by Universal Music, a label with artists including Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, Drake and Kendrick Lamar. AI companies are now fighting so many copyright lawsuits that a tech industry lobby group, the Chamber of Progress, last week called on President Donald Trump to sign an executive order directing federal attorneys ""to intervene in legal cases"" to defend the industry's practice of building generative AI tools by feeding them on copyrighted works. Citing more than 50 pending federal cases, the group asked for help stopping court fights leading to ""potentially company-killing penalties"" that threaten AI innovation. But artists have warned that AI tools built on their works also threaten their livelihoods. In the biggest settlement so far, AI company Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion — or $3,000 per book — to settle claims from authors who alleged the company illegally pirated nearly half a million of their works to train its chatbot. Udio and Universal didn't disclose the financial terms of their new music licensing agreements. They also said they will team up on a new streaming platform. As part of the agreement, Udio immediately stopped allowing people to download songs they've created, which sparked a backlash and apparent exodus among paying users. ""We know the pain it causes to you,"" Udio later said in a post on Reddit's Udio forum, where users were venting about feeling betrayed by the platform's surprise move and complained that it limited what they could do with their music. Udio said it still must stop downloads as it transitions to a new streaming platform next year. But over the weekend, it said it will give people 48 hours starting at 11 a.m. Eastern time Monday to keep their ""past creations."" ""Udio is a small company operating in an incredibly complex and evolving space, and we believe that partnering directly with artists and songwriters is the way forward,"" said Udio's post. The settlement deal was the music industry's first since Universal, along with Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Records, sued Udio and another AI song generator, Suno, last year over copyright infringement. Udio and Suno pioneered AI song generation technology, which can spit out new songs based on prompts typed into a chatbot-style text box. Users, who don't need musical talent, can merely request a tune in the style of, for example, classic rock, 1980s synth-pop or West Coast rap. Record labels have accused the platforms of exploiting the recorded works of artists without compensating them. In its lawsuit filed against Udio last year, Universal sought to show how specific AI-generated songs made on Udio closely resembled Universal-owned classics like Frank Sinatra's ""My Way,"" The Temptations' ""My Girl,"" ABBA's ""Dancing Queen"" and holiday favorites like ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" and ""Jingle Bell Rock."" A musician-led group, the Artist Rights Alliance, said Friday that the Universal-Udio settlement represents a positive step in creating a ""legitimate AI marketplace"" but raised questions about whether independent artists, session musicians and songwriters will be sufficiently protected from AI practices that present an ""existential threat"" to their careers. ""Licensing is the only version of AI's future that doesn't result in the mass destruction of art and culture,"" the group said. ""But this promise must be available to all music creators, not just to major corporate copyright holders.""",2025-11-02 20:08:00,Wmur
Chargers’ Joe Alt carted off field with ankle injury against Titans,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Jim Harbaugh didn't have an update on Los Angeles Chargers left tackle Joe Alt after he was carted off the field Sunday, and what the coach said wasn't promising. Alt hurt his right ankle in the second quarter against the Tennessee Titans, and a cart came out pretty quickly to take him off the field. Alt never returned as the Chargers beat the Titans 27-20. “Yeah, feel that,” Harbaugh said when asked about seeing Alt go down. “Feel for him, feel bad for him.” Alt missed three games with a sprained right ankle and returned Oct. 23 in the Chargers' win over Minnesota. He didn't get up after a long incompletion by Justin Herbert with 4:49 left in the first half against Tennessee. Jamaree Salyer replaced Alt on the next play, and the Chargers gave up their second sack on the next play after Alt was taken off the field. The Chargers already had right tackle Bobby Hart leave in the first quarter with a groin injury. Trey Pipkins III, who came in at right tackle, said it's never easy seeing someone go down. “It’s difficult, but I mean, that’s kind of the nature of the position, right?” Pipkins said. “I feel like the O-line room specifically have a lot of camaraderie. We got a lot of tradition and that’s our standard is that when people go down, people step up.” The Chargers (6-3) wound up giving up a season-high six sacks without their offensive tackles. Harbaugh said other players stepped up. “Sometimes you could say ... the team finds itself in a situation where it’s got its back against the wall,” Harbaugh said. “I mean, that’s when you find out who you really are. Felt that’s what our guys did today. Dug deep, gritty win, found a way to win.”",2025-11-02 20:07:56,Sportsnet
Earthquake Today: Significant Casualties Expected As 6.3-Magnitude Quake Strikes Afghanistan,"Date The quake was detected near the city of Mazar-i-Sharif and the town of Khulm, and struck at a depth of 23 kilometres, as per the National Center for Seismology (NCS). Given the timing of the earthquake, which struck at at 1 am local time, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) warned that it could be deadly. ""Significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread. Past events with this alert level have required a regional or national level response,"" the USGS was quoted as saying by CNN. Afghanistan's national disaster management agency said assessments on casualties and damages would be shared later, reported Reuters. Afghanistan is no stranger to deadly earthquakes, having seen major ones in the recent past. Earlier in August this year, at least 2,200 people were killed and more than 2,800 others were injured after a 6.0-magnitude struck the mountainous stretch of provinces in the eastern region of Afghanistan. The quake on 31 August had struck Afghanistan's Kunar province at 11.47 pm local time. Two years back, in October 2023, Afghanistan also saw widespread devastation after four large earthquakes measuring 6.3 in magnitude, and their aftershocks, struck near the city of Herat. Over 1,000 people lost their lives in the 2023 quake and over 2,400 were reportedly injured. (This is a developing story. Check back for updates.)

Sabalenka serves her way past Paolini at WTA Finals; Gauff hits 17 double-faults in loss to Pegula,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka put on a dominant serving display in her opening match at the WTA finals, producing 10 aces in a 6-3, 6-1 win over No. 8-ranked Jasmine Paolini on Sunday. Sabalenka served four aces in the final game of the first set alone and overall put 82.7% of her first serves in play. The match, which was Sabalenka’s 500th at the WTA level, lasted 70 minutes. “I was focused, I was calm and it felt like everything was in control,” Sabalenka said. On Saturday, Sabalenka was presented with a trophy for finishing the year at No. 1. “I’m super happy and super proud of the work that has been done and that things are working and I’m getting better and better every day,” she said. “And I just hope that we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and hopefully we can stay there.” The season-ending tournament for the year’s top eight players starts with two four-woman groups of round-robin play. The top two finishers in each group advance to the semifinals. “I take this tournament as a regular tournament that I have to win five matches if I want to win the title,” Sabalenka said. “So I’m just trying to bring my best tennis and fight for every point.” In the same group, Jessica Pegula beat defending champion Coco Gauff 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-2 in an all-American matchup. Gauff again struggled with her serve, hitting 17 double-faults — including one to hand the first set to Pegula, her former doubles partner. Before she ultimately pulled it out in the tiebreaker, Gauff twice failed to serve out the second set. On her second such chance, she hit three consecutive double-faults to let Pegula break her again and force a tiebreaker. Three weeks ago, Gauff beat Pegula in the final of the Wuhan Open in China. “Obviously, little frustrated with the serve today,” Gauff said. “Overall, it was a tough match for me. Jess played well and I thought she was playing a bit smarter than she was when we played in Wuhan.” Added Pegula, “Coco is a great champion, great competitor, good friend. So it’s always tough playing her. I don’t think there’s any secrets with this group of girls here.” Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina won their opening matches on Saturday. Also Saturday, Paolini and partner Sara Errani won their opening doubles match. AP tennis: Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Could AI help treat people with prostate cancer? A groundbreaking study is set to find out,"A new study is set to investigate how AI could significantly improve doctors’ decisions regarding prostate cancer treatment. While diagnostic methods for the disease have become safer and more precise, medical professionals still face considerable challenges in accurately assessing its aggressiveness in individual patients. This difficulty can lead to some men undergoing invasive procedures such as surgery or radiotherapy, when a less aggressive monitoring approach might have been more appropriate. The crucial Vanguard Path study, spearheaded by researchers at the University of Oxford, is being funded with a £1.9m grant from the charity Prostate Cancer UK to address this vital issue. Experts will first test the technology – called ArteraAI Prostate Biopsy Assay – on prostate biopsy samples from men who have already been diagnosed and treated for the disease and have at least five years of follow-up data. The study will compare how well the predictions made by the AI tool match what happened to patients in the real world. It will then be tested in real clinics on biopsies from men as they are diagnosed, with a focus on cases in which doctors find it hard to decide the best course of treatment. The three NHS organisations taking part are North Bristol NHS Trust, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Professor Clare Verrill, lead researcher on the project, said the trial “will pave the way for advanced AI technologies” to be rolled out on the NHS. “This will enable more detailed and precise information to be provided to men who will be able to make better-informed decisions with their clinical team about whether they can be safely monitored or need treatment – and, if so, help guide those decisions,” she added. Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “AI has the potential to massively improve prostate cancer care and make sure that every man has the most accurate and best treatment plan for his specific cancer. “We’ve been working with Artera for several years now and I believe that their AI tool is one of the most exciting ones to have been developed. But exciting AI tools can only make a difference if they can be properly evaluated. “This new project from Professor Verrill and her team is so exciting, because it tests this new technology in real-world settings, meaning we can deliver the final evidence needed for it to be rolled out across the NHS.” Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males and about one in eight men will have it in their lifetime, according to Prostate Cancer UK. Some 58,218 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in England in 2024, up from 53,462 the year before, according to the National Prostate Cancer Audit (NPCA). Andre Esteva, chief executive and co-founder of Artera, said: “We developed the ArteraAI Prostate Biopsy Assay to help improve the lives of prostate cancer patients and have spent years gathering evidence about its potential impact. “We’re delighted to be working with Professor Verrill and her team to see how the test could be used to maximise benefit for men in the NHS and hope that we will soon see the tool being used to personalise prostate cancer care for men in the UK.” News of the study comes days after it emerged an NHS trial will use AI to interpret MRI scans from men suspected of having prostate cancer. If the software detects a scan it deems high risk for the disease, it will be sent to radiologists for priority review and the patient will be booked in for a same-day biopsy. Specialists can then review results and either rule out or diagnose prostate cancer faster. The pilot will run in 15 hospitals, NHS England said.

‘UK public have tougher stance on immigration and diversity than people in US’,"People in the UK are less likely than their US counterparts to feel diversity strengthens society and more likely to have tougher attitudes on immigration, according to research. The findings are said to show that a common narrative about Britain being more socially liberal than America does not ring true across all issues. The National Centre for Social Research also found Reform UK voters in Britain were more likely than supporters of President Donald Trump in the US to say immigrants living in their country without permission should not be allowed to stay. While seven in 10 supporters of Mr Trump felt this way, the figure was almost eight in 10 (79%) among Reform followers. The researchers said they wanted to “better understand how public attitudes in the UK compare with those in the US, and the extent of polarisation in the two countries”. Their survey found 42% of people in the UK think there should be legal efforts to deport immigrants living here without permission, compared with just a third (33%) in the US. While almost two-thirds (64%) of respondents in the US felt diversity strengthens society, only around half (49%) of the UK public agreed. Proportions were similar when it came to how open their country is to people from around the world, with 63% in the US feeling this is essential to national identity but only 49% of people in the UK feeling this way. Alex Scholes, research director at NatCen, said: “The idea that Britain is more socially liberal than America doesn’t hold up across all issues. “While the UK is clearly more liberal on questions to do with family, sexuality and religion, attitudes to immigration and diversity show the opposite pattern. “People in the UK are less likely than those in the US to see diversity as a strength, or to think that openness to people from other countries is essential to who we are as a nation. Our findings suggest that polarisation in the two countries looks very different. “In the UK, the sharpest divides are around immigration and national identity, in the US they’re around social issues and the role of government. These differences will shape political debate on both sides in the years to come.” When it comes to issues such as abortion, contraception and same-sex marriage, people in the UK were found to be more liberal in their attitudes. The vast majority (92%) of people in the UK said contraception being widely available is good for society, compared with 78% in the US, and while around six in 10 (59%) people in the UK think same-sex marriage being legal is good for society, only around a third (34%) said so in the US. While 86% of people in the UK think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, fewer than two thirds (63%) felt this way in the US. Reform UK voters had a more liberal view on abortion, with 82% thinking it should be legal in all or most cases, compared with 35% of supporters of Mr Trump. – More than 2,000 UK residents aged 16 and over were surveyed in June 2025, being asked the same questions as more than 8,000 people in the US aged 18 and over who were surveyed in April 2024. Both were weighted to be representative of their respective country’s population.",2025-11-03 00:04:00,Harrow Times
Repairs start on church tower at risk of falling,"Work is to begin on a Grade II listed church tower that has been deemed at risk of falling on to surrounding town centre pavements. St Lawrence Church, on Dial Lane in Ipswich, is currently used as a community cafe and it will have its flint and stone work restored after plans were approved in November 2024. It came after inspections by Ipswich Borough Council in December 2023 found certain parts of the tower were bulging and at risk of falling. The proposed works will ensure the decommissioned church is preserved and continues to operate as a community hub and cafe. Protective scaffolding was put in place to ensure the safety of the public until repair work started. The medieval church, which is leased by the Ipswich Historic Churches Trust, houses the oldest circle of church bells in the world. In 2023, the church became the backdrop for Amazon Prime's period drama Boudica: Queen of War, which looked at the failed revolt against the Roman Empire by the East Anglian tribal ruler.

Judge again bars Trump administration from deploying troops to Portland,"A federal judge in Oregon has once again barred President Donald Trump’s administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon until at least Friday PORTLAND, Ore. -- A federal judge in Oregon on Sunday barred President Donald Trump’s administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon until at least Friday, saying she “found no credible evidence” that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall. The city and state sued in September to block the deployment. It's the latest development in weeks of legal back-and-forth in Portland, Chicago and other U.S. cities as the Trump administration has moved to federalize and deploy the National Guard in city streets to quell protests. The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law. In a 16-page filing late Sunday, Immergut said she would issue a final order on Friday due to the voluminous evidence presented at trial, including more than 750 exhibits. The purpose of the deployment, according to the Trump administration, is to protect federal personnel and property where protests are occurring or likely to occur. Legal experts said that a higher appellate court order that remains in effect would have barred troops from being deployed anyway. Immergut wrote that most violence appeared to be between protesters and counter-protesters and found no evidence of “significant damage” to the immigration facility at the center of the protests. ""Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President’s federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,” she wrote. The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue — seek to push back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states’ sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because it has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces — one of the conditions set by Congress for calling up troops. Immergut issued two orders in early October that blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. She previously found that Trump had failed to show that he met the legal requirements for mobilizing the National Guard. She described his assessment of Portland, which Trump has called “war-ravaged” with “fires all over the place,” as “simply untethered to the facts.” One of Immergut’s orders was paused Oct. 20 by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But late Tuesday, the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the matter before an 11-judge panel. Until the larger panel rehears the case, the appeals court’s initial order from early October — under which the National Guard is federalized but not deployed — remains in effect. During the Portland trial, witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city’s ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Trump’s National Guard announcement. The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion” — another one of the conditions for calling up troops under federal law. Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., due to safety concerns. R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland’s ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter. He also said he was “surprised” to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down. Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified. Another Federal Protective Service official whom the judge also allowed to testify under his initials said protesters have at times been violent, damaged the facility and acted aggressively toward officers working at the building. The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer due to property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions. Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Scott Kennedy said that “without minimizing or condoning offensive expressions” or certain instances of criminal conduct, “none of these incidents suggest ... that there’s a rebellion or an inability to execute the laws.” ___ Johnson reported from Seattle. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2025-11-03 06:45:58,Abc News
"Women in Blue, World Champions: Tech titans Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella hail India’s historic World Cup win","New Delhi, Nov 3, 2025 Global tech leaders Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella joined millions of Indians in celebrating the country’s maiden triumph at the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025, lauding the team’s grit, inspiration, and historic achievement. Google CEO Sundar Pichai took to X to express his excitement after India’s thrilling victory over South Africa in the final at DY Patil Stadium on Sunday. “That was a nail-biting women’s world cup cricket final, memories of 1983 and 2011 indeed. Congrats to Team India, am sure will inspire a whole generation. Great tournament from South Africa too!” he wrote, drawing parallels between the women’s team’s triumph and India’s iconic men’s World Cup wins. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also saluted the champions in his post, declaring, “Women in Blue = World Champions! Respect to South Africa for making their first-ever final. A truly historic day for women’s cricket—new chapters written, barriers broken, legends born.” His words reflected the broader sentiment that India’s win marks a new era for women’s sport globally. The posts from two of the world’s most influential tech leaders underscored the worldwide recognition of India’s achievement. India’s women’s team made history by clinching their first-ever Women’s ODI World Cup, defeating South Africa by 52 runs. All-rounder Deepti Sharma was the star performer, scoring 58 runs and taking a five-wicket haul to seal the win. Put in to bat, India rode on Deepti’s fifty and a solid top-order effort to post 298/7 in 50 overs. The South African chase, anchored by captain Laura Wolvaardt’s valiant innings, ended at 246 in 45.3 overs, as the Indian bowlers held their nerve to script history. With this win, India became only the third country, after England and Australia, to have won both the men’s and women’s ODI World Cups. The triumph was even more special as the Indian team had endured a difficult journey, losing three consecutive matches in the group stage and barely qualifying for the semifinals. They then stunned Australia before overpowering South Africa in the final. The final, already being hailed as one of the greatest in tournament history, has not only united fans across the globe but also reaffirmed India’s growing dominance in world cricket.(Agency)",2025-11-03 06:45:56,Yes Punjab News
China's Strategic Visa-Free Expansion to Boost Tourism and Trade,"China has announced an extension of its visa-free entry policy for 45 countries, including France, Germany, and Spain, until December 31, 2026. This policy, effective from November 10, will also now include Sweden, as per the foreign ministry's announcement on Monday. This extension encompasses 32 European countries alongside Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and several countries from South America and the Gulf region. Initially set to expire at the year's end, this policy aims to attract more foreign visitors, revitalize a tourism sector hit hard by stringent COVID-19 restrictions, and enhance international engagement. Notably, the United States, Canada, and Britain remain excluded from this list. The policy allows citizens from eligible nations to visit China for up to 30 days for business, tourism, or family visits without a visa. Furthermore, China is seeking to strengthen its ties with the European Union, a critical trading partner amid challenging trade relations. In addition, following discussions last week, Beijing confirmed a one-year suspension of its expanded rare earth export controls to the EU as part of efforts to stabilize industrial and supply chains.

BCCI announces Rs 51 crore reward as India’s women clinch maiden World Cup,"New Delhi, Nov 3: In a watershed moment for Indian cricket, the national women’s team etched their name in history by winning their first-ever ICC Women’s World Cup title, defeating South Africa by 52 runs in a pulsating final at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday night. Celebrations erupted across the country as BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia reportedly announced a Rs 51 crore reward for the players and support staff, hailing the victory as a “monumental achievement that will take Indian women’s cricket to a new level.” Meanwhile, IPL chairman Arun Dhumal lauded the team’s historic feat, drawing parallels with India’s iconic 1983 men’s World Cup triumph. “It’s a red-letter day for Indian women’s cricket. What the men’s team achieved in 1983, the Indian women have recreated today in Mumbai. This historic triumph will give a tremendous boost to women’s cricket in the country, and I’m confident our game will now reach new heights,” Dhumal said. Earlier, batting first, India posted a commanding 298/7, powered by Shafali Verma’s fluent 87, Deepti Sharma’s composed 58, and valuable contributions from Smriti Mandhana (45) and Richa Ghosh (34). A solid 100-run opening stand between Mandhana and Verma set the platform for a big total before South Africa clawed back late to keep India just under the 300-mark. Chasing 299, South Africa began confidently as Tazmin Brits and Laura Wolvaardt put together a brisk fifty-run opening partnership. But a sharp direct hit from Amanjot Kaur ended Brits’ stay, and from there, India seized control of the contest. Young pacer Sree Charani struck in her first over, trapping Anneke Bosch LBW, before Shafali Verma — shining with the ball as well — produced a game-turning spell, removing Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp in quick succession. Deepti Sharma then delivered a dream performance, claiming 5 for 39 to crush South Africa’s middle order. Despite Wolvaardt’s fighting 101, the Proteas fell short, bundled out for 246 in 45.3 overs, as India sealed a famous 52-run victory amid roaring home support. As the tricolour soared high and the players embraced in tears of joy, the moment marked not just a World Cup triumph — but the dawn of a new era for Indian women’s cricket.

"Liverpool injury update: Alexander Isak, Alisson Becker and Jeremie Frimpong latest news and return dates","Sport | Football Liverpool returned to winning ways with a 2-0 victory over Aston Villa to end their four-game losing streak in the Premier League. Pressure was piling on Arne Slot after the Reds slumped to ninth in the table, but even without a number of key players, the champions were able to sweep Villa aside to move back up to third. They welcome Real Madrid - Trent Alexander-Arnold, Xabi Alonso, et al - to Anfield in midweek, before they take on Manchester City in a mouth-watering encounter at the weekend. But will they have any of their star names back from injury? Ahead of a big few weeks, here’s all the latest Liverpool injury news and return dates... Alexander Isak has endured a tough start to life on Merseyside. Subbed at half-time in Liverpool’s 5-1 win over Frankfurt in the Champions League, Slot later revealed the £125million summer signing had suffered a minor groin injury. “Alexander had to go off at half-time because he felt his groin a little bit. That's a pity,” said Slot. “I've said many times it is such a difficult balance to find with a player that missed three months.” Isak was not in the squad in the 3-2 loss at Brentford, and he also missed out on the Carabao Cup defeat against Crystal Palace, as well as the win over Villa. No watering down of Hillsborough Law, says Lammy ahead of first debate Van Dijk hits back at Rooney over 'lazy' criticism of him and Salah Liverpool vs Real Madrid: Prediction, kick-off time, team news, odds Frieze season in London: here’s what not to miss Slot has provided no further update on the Swede. Potential return date: Unknown Jeremie Frimpong is facing a second spell on the sidelines, and he is just months into his Liverpool career. He suffered a hamstring injury against Bournemouth on his Premier League debut and suffered the same fate against Frankfurt. The right-back was dealt a further blow last week, with reports revealing that the Dutchman would be out of action for six weeks. That means that he could miss games against Aston Villa, Real Madrid, Manchester City, Nottingham Forest, PSV Eindhoven and West Ham at the very least. Potential return date: December Curtis Jones started against Brentford, but asked to be replaced in the second half after going down with an injury. The exact nature or severity of his issue is not clear but Slot did not seem overly alarmed by his condition when he spoke at full-time. He said: “We have to wait and see. He asked to be taken off. He walked off instead of needing a lot of treatment so I have to wait and see.” He was not involved in the squads against Palace or Villa. Potential return date: Unknown Alisson Becker suffered a hamstring injury against Galatasaray in September. Speaking ahead of the Brentford game, Slot said: ""Alisson is not in the squad tomorrow. That's also going to take a little bit longer."" Slot had previously suggested that Alisson was weeks away from returning but this week’s two key games - as much as the Reds would love their first-choice shot-stopper back - may come too soon. Potential return date: November Leoni suffered an ACL injury on his Liverpool debut against Southampton back in September. The 18-year-old impressed in his first minutes in red, but was stretchered off shortly after. He later underwent surgery and is expected to spend a year on the sidelines. “He’s not in a good place, of course,” Slot said of the Italian. “He tore his ACL which means that he will be out for around a year.” Potential return date: Late 2026 MORE ABOUT",2025-11-03 06:45:52,Evening Standard
What's on the ballot in the first general election since Donald Trump became president,"Donald Trump features prominently in state and local elections happening Tuesday, a year after he retook the White House WASHINGTON -- One year after Donald Trump retook the White House and set into motion a dramatic expansion of executive power, the Republican president figures prominently in state and local elections being held Tuesday. The results of those contests — the first general election of Trump's second term — will be heralded by the victors as either a major repudiation or resounding stamp of approval of his second-term agenda. That's especially true in high-profile races for Virginia and New Jersey governor, New York City mayor and a California proposition to redraw its congressional district boundaries. More than half of the states will hold contests on Tuesday. Here's a look at some of the major statewide and local races on the ballot: In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are the nominees to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. Sherrill is a four-term U.S. representative and former Navy helicopter pilot. Ciattarelli is a former state Assemblyman backed by Trump. In 2021, Ciattarelli came within about 3 percentage points of toppling Murphy. In Virginia, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and Democratic former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger look to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. While Spanberger has made some efforts to focus on topics other than Trump in stump speeches, the president remained a major topic of conversation throughout the campaign, from comments Earle-Sears made about him in 2022 to some of his more polarizing policies, such as the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill tax and spending cut measure and the widespread dismissal of federal workers, many of whom live in northern Virginia. Trump was scheduled to participate in telephone rallies for the candidates on Monday night. As the only gubernatorial races held in the year following a presidential election, the contests have long served as the first major test of voter sentiment toward the party holding the White House. In every race for governor since 1973, one or both states have elected a governor from a party different than that of the sitting president. The race to lead the nation’s largest city features Democratic state legislator Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate and former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani’s comfortable victory over Cuomo in the June primary generated excitement from the party’s more progressive wing and apprehension among the party establishment. Party leaders like Gov. Kathy Hochul and U.S. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries eventually endorsed the self-described democratic socialist months after he won the nomination. The winner will replace outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, who initially sought renomination as a Democrat. After losing the primary Adams opted to run as an independent, but dropped out of the race in September and eventually endorsed Cuomo. In February, the Trump Justice Department asked a court to drop corruption charges against Adams because the case impeded Trump’s “ immigration objectives.” Trump later said he’d like to see both Adams and Sliwa drop out of the race in an effort to defeat Mamdani. California voters will decide a statewide ballot measure that would enact a new congressional map that could flip as many as five Republican-held U.S. House seats to Democratic control. Proposition 50, championed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, is in response to a new Texas map that state Republicans enacted in August as part of Trump’s efforts to keep the U.S. House under Republican control in the 2026 midterms. The Texas plan, which could help Republicans flip five Democratic-held U.S. House seats, has sparked an escalating gerrymandering arms race among states to pass new maps outside of the regular once-a-decade schedule. Control of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will be at stake when voters cast Yes or No votes on whether to retain three justices from the high court’s 5-2 Democratic majority. Partisan control of the court could have major implications for the 2028 presidential race, since justices might be asked to rule on election disputes, as they did in 2020. Spending on Tuesday's contests is on track to exceed $15 million as Republicans have campaigned to end the majority and Democrats have responded. If all three justices are ousted, a deadlock in the confirmation process to replace them could result in a court tied at 2-2. An election to fill any vacant seats for full 10-year terms would be held in 2027. VIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Republican incumbent Jason Miyares seeks a second term against Democrat Jay Jones. Much of the fall campaign has focused on text messages suggesting violence against political rivals that Jones sent in 2022. TEXAS-18: Sixteen candidates hope to fill a vacant congressional seat previously held by the late Democratic U.S. Rep. Sylvester Turner. STATE LEGISLATURES: Control of the Minnesota Senate and Virginia House of Delegates is at stake, while New Jersey Democrats defend their 52-28 General Assembly majority. BALLOT MEASURES: Maine voters will decide statewide questions on voting and a “red flag” law aimed at preventing gun violence. Texas’ 17 ballot measures include constitutional amendments on parental rights and limiting voting to U.S. citizens. Colorado and Washington also have statewide measures on the ballot. MAYORS: Detroit, Pittsburgh, Jersey City and Buffalo will elect new mayors, while incumbents in Atlanta, Minneapolis and Cincinnati seek another term. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the 2025 election at 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2025-11-03 06:45:51,Abc News
Asking Eric: Does my husband’s family exclude him from birthday tradition because they think he’s rich?,"Dear Eric: My husband and I have been married for almost 10 years. He has three siblings, and it seems like he’s the forgotten one. His mom and siblings always put money together and send it for each other’s birthdays. Last year and the year before that, they did it for everyone’s birthday except my husband. He was very upset about it but said nothing. This year his mom asked him and his siblings to send money to give another sibling for their birthday. My husband, of course, sent the money. I’m tired of my husband participating in everyone’s birthday and then being ignored for his. I would love to speak up and say something but not sure it’s my place to do that as an in-law. I’m just trying to figure out if there’s a nice way to let them know how hurtful it is or if there’s a way to get out of sending money since my husband is excluded. I would like to add that they all get along great and they’re close so not sure why he’s always left out. His mom did tell one of her friends not to send us anything because we make too much money and don’t need it. Our income is average/barely middle class for the state we live in. We are not rich and one of his siblings makes more money than us. I’m frustrated about the whole situation and would appreciate your advice on how to handle it. – Fed Up with Exclusions Dear Fed Up: It sounds like your husband could use an advocate and the family could use some help with communication. You can start the ball rolling on both by taking the reins. Rally folks yourself for your husband’s birthday. You can even tell his mother and siblings, “I notice that this is a family tradition, and I think it makes him feel left out to not get anything for his birthday, so I decided to organize on his behalf this year. It will mean a lot.” The other family members might see your point and gladly chip in. Or they might protest, and this is where the conversation about money might come up, giving you a chance to correct their misconception. Also, if they don’t want to give money, surely there’s some other way they include him. Ultimately, from your view, it’s not so much about cash as it is about feeling loved. Lead with that and it may help your husband’s mother and siblings open their eyes, and, potentially, their wallets. Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O.

The real test of Lee’s pragmatic diplomacy comes after APEC,"The end of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Gyeongju marked the conclusion of a crucial, jam-packed week of diplomacy for South Korea, with the leaders of two superpowers — the US and China — both in attendance. At the helm of the first large-scale international summit event hosted by South Korea in 20 years was President Lee Jae Myung, who cleared away economic and security-related uncertainties by wrapping up negotiations with the US while taking the first steps to repair Seoul’s estrangement from Beijing. Lee also met with other leaders in the Asia-Pacific region and shored up trust aimed at building a future of shared prosperity. But many observers are saying the real challenge starts now as South Korea seeks to navigate the kind of worst-case scenario that it narrowly avoided by adopting a pragmatic focus on national interests amid a rapidly changing “new normal” in the global order. “We did a pretty good job of toughing things out in a situation where the outcome was never going to be 100% satisfactory to us,” assessed Korea National Diplomatic Academy professor Jun Bong-geun on Sunday regarding the agreements reached on trade and security matters at a South Korea-US summit. “For now, the fog has been cleared away,” he added, suggesting the outcomes can be viewed positively as Lee having taken care of immediate uncertainties while sidestepping a worst-case scenario in dealing with US President Donald Trump, who is known for unpredictability. Along similar lines, former KNDA Chancellor Hong Hyun-ik said that Lee had “made the best available choice without stalling for time in a world where the ‘new normal’ is US overreach.” The arrangement reached on the biggest issue concerning the fund for South Korean investment in the US — where the total of cash investment was set at US$200 billion and capped at US$20 billion annually — was more or less a realistic compromise solution. In other words, Seoul went for the next-best or least-worst option under hegemonic trade pressures from the Trump administration. Commenting on this, Kim Joon-hyung, a former chancellor of the KDNA and current Rebuilding Korea Party lawmaker, said that South Korea “will need to adjust the pace, frequency and intensity of investment during the future implementation process.” In the summit’s immediate wake, the US made claims that conflicted with the South Korean government’s announcement, including Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick’s insistence that semiconductor tariffs were not part of the agreement. Kim’s remarks suggested that Seoul will need to adopt a firm stance as differences arise between the two sides in the implementation process. Observers similarly rated Lee’s summit with Xi Jinping as a generally successful first step, with the Chinese president taking steps to repair relations on his first visit to South Korea in 11 years. Seoul and Beijing have been on distant terms owing to friction over the deployment of a US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile system in Korea in 2016 and foreign policies under the Yoon Suk-yeol administration that were heavily skewed toward the US. While the summit did not fulfill hopes for a second-phase upgrade to the two sides’ free trade agreement or securing China’s definite support for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, analysts suggested this was more than could be expected as a first step. According to sources, Xi and Lee appeared to enjoy a pleasant conversation at a closed-door dinner, where they openly discussed advancements in bilateral relations. What remains now is the task of translating that into concrete improvements, including the lifting of Chinese restrictions on Korean cultural content. “While relations with the US and Japan have substantially progressed and been established, we’re still working on restoring trust with China, so we should strongly consider a visit to China before the end of the year,” Hong said. Some observers in the diplomatic world said that for Lee’s “pragmatic diplomacy” to truly contribute to upholding the national interest, he will need to focus on balanced diplomacy between China and the US now that Korea is back on track to restoring its relationship with the former and the latter continues to demand one-sided sacrifices from its allies. One source in the foreign affairs community stressed, “We need to avoid the situation where we’re pressed to take sides as the competition between the US and China intensifies, and that will require the wisdom to manage bilateral relations well from the middle ground.” By Um Ji-won, staff reporter Please direct questions or comments to [english@hani.co.kr]",2025-11-03 08:04:00,Hani
Accounting experts call for public inquiry into Birmingham bankruptcy,"Warakorn - stock.adobe.com Thirty-five accounting, finance and local government experts have signed an open letter to local government minister Steve Reed, calling for a public inquiry into the bankruptcy of Birmingham City Council. The open letter, which looks at the latest accounts from the council, notes that some of the figures used to “bankrupt” Birmingham City Council, including forecast levels of reserves and alleged equal pay liabilities, look like they have been materially misstated. Since the failed implementation of an Oracle enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to replace SAP in April 2022, the council has faced significant issues with the processes and interfaces, as well as the system’s ability to produce reports. In effect, the council was unable to find out what money was being spent, what it was owed and how much it had received. Budget forecasting had to be carried out based on the best available data and organisational intelligence. In April 2023, council leader John Cotton discussed the disastrous implementation of the ERP system, and in September 2023, the council issued a Section 114 bankruptcy notice. Birmingham City Council’s Section 114 bankruptcy notice led to a rise in the council’s borrowing costs, an 18% rise in Council Tax bills, along with the ongoing bin strike dispute with Unite the Union. Significantly, the council has had to cut its budget and sell assets to help it reduce costs. The letter also states that there has been a steep rise in external audit fees and the significant costs charged by the city’s commissioners, who were appointed without the usual best value assessment. In a post on X, James Brackley a lecturer in accounting at University of Glasgow, who prepared an analysis of the accounting at Birmingham City Council, wrote: “The latest analysis proves beyond doubt that Birmingham was never ‘bankrupt’ with the bankruptcy & subsequent intervention being based on imagined data as the authority underestimated its reserves and exaggerated its (non-existent) deficits by hundreds of millions of pounds. This has since led to the biggest program of cuts and asset sales any authority has ever faced.” He added that the asset sales in 2024/25 against an underlying balanced position actually led to huge surpluses across all core reserves in the latest accounts. Commenting on the post, Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, tweeted: “Government Commissioners, being paid £1200 a day, are not needed. Unite repeatedly advised the council that their figures were simply wrong, as was their legal advice. This is a disgraceful tale. Yet again, workers and residents are paying the price for a crisis and incompetence not of their making.” Following the publication of a Grant Thornton report in February 2025, which looked at what went wrong with the implementation of the Oracle system, the council revised the implementation of Oracle to April 2026. However, as of September 2025, it is believed that the income management system (IMS) at Birmingham City Council – a key application that needs to work with the Oracle system – is not fully working. Previously, the lack of a fully functioning IMS meant workarounds were needed for financial reporting.",2025-11-03 08:04:00,Computerweekly News
Dear Abby: MIL blurts out ‘I’m so disappointed that my first-born married such an awful human being’,"DEAR ABBY: My relationship with my mother-in-law has been rocky for the nine years I’ve been married to her daughter. She has been very hurtful at times, saying things like, “You’re not welcome [in her house].” She has never accepted me.

We had asked her to keep it light and just enjoy lunch together, but she started telling us my wife should apologize to her niece over a trivial misunderstanding.

Amol Muzumdar: One of the greatest to never play for India carves his own cricketing legacy,"New Delhi: Despite scoring truckloads of runs in domestic cricket, Amol Muzumdar’s dream of representing India never saw the light of day. Perhaps, fate had planned it all along. During his school days, Muzumdar was rated highly along with his schoolmates Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli at Shardashram Vidyamandir School in Mumbai. Coached by Ramakant Achrekar, Muzumdar once famously waited with his pads on for two days as Achrekar’s other two students, Tendulkar and Kambli, shared a world-record 664-run partnership in a 1988 school. Mazumdar never got a chance to bat, and while Tendulkar and Kambli went on to play for India, Muzumdar, despite proving himself in domestic cricket year after year, kept waiting for his chance and finally ended a two-decade-long illustrious career in 2014. It was destiny’s call that a player of Muzumdar’s calibre couldn’t don the India colours. It was destiny’s call, too, that 11 years after retirement, he realised his India dream by guiding the women’s team to a historic maiden ODI World Cup title. After his playing days were over, Muzumdar transitioned to coaching and built a reputation as a mentor who is an expert in reading players and situations. In domestic cricket, he coached Mumbai, Andhra, and later worked with the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL before moving to the international stage with a stint with South Africa’s cricket team as a batting consultant. When Muzumdar was appointed as India’s women’s coach in 2023, the team was in turmoil after years of instability in the coaching set-up. However, he quickly won over the dressing room, built the foundation of a cohesive team and rallied the team to aim towards one goal. His leadership style worked wonders for the team and superstar players like Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana, and Deepti Sharma. After a solid start to the campaign, the Women in Blue suffered multiple setbacks, which threatened to derail their campaign. However, Muzumdar’s strong reminder to the team of their abilities and goal helped India regroup and find a newfound energy and rhythm. Listening to a man who embodies grit and resilience worked like a magic potion for the team, evident from two extraordinary performances – vs Australia in the semifinal and vs South Africa in the final. On November 2, 2025, the historic day when India defeated South Africa to lift their maiden World Cup, life came a full circle for Muzumdar, one of the greatest cricketers to never play for India.

Real reason Andrew's Royal Lodge eviction announcement took so long,"Andrew hit an all-time royal low last week as it was announced he was to be stripped of all his royal titles and evicted from his 30-room Royal Lodge home. Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming. While the King’s actions have been praised, some believe the monarch, 76, took too long to take action, especially over evicting the former prince from his Crown Estate mansion, however Queen Elizabeth's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson has now explained why.

They (the Royal Family) had to take constitutional advice and legal advice and over the lease on Royal Lodge. ""They had to get all the dots on I’s and T’s crossed before they made this announcement."" Anderson also said the situation would have been “difficult” for the King, especially as Andrew is his younger brother. She said: “It must be mixed emotions for him (the King). That is why this has taken such a long time. It is family and monarchy, and when the lines are blurred, it’s very difficult for them.” Andrew is expected to leave Royal Lodge within months despite originally having a lease until 2078. It was confirmed last week that he will move to a property on the monarch’s private Sandringham estate.

Indore News: Metro To Go Underground From Khajrana Square,"Indore (Madhya Pradesh): The Indore Metro route will now go underground from Khajrana Square itself, passing through Palasia to Bada Ganpati, as approved in a high-level meeting chaired by urban development and housing minister Kailash Vijayvargiya on Monday. The decision, finalized after hours of detailed discussions, is being hailed as a major step towards improving traffic management and urban mobility in the city. The proposal for the underground stretch of the metro from Khajrana to Bada Ganpati via Palasia received unanimous approval. Minister Vijayvargiya said, “This decision will prove historic for Indore, both for the city’s economic growth as well as traffic management. Together, we will make this project a success.” He said that all public representatives unanimously decided to make the Metro train route underground from the Khajrana area. He explained that in the earlier design, the Metro was planned to go underground from Nath Mandir Road near the high court, to Bada Ganpati. However, under the new plan, the route would now be taken underground from Khajrana itself. The minister further informed that a Malharganj Metro station would be constructed, but no houses or shops would be affected in the process. Using advanced tunnelling technology, similar to the one used in Chandni Chowk (Delhi), a machine would bore the tunnel without causing any surface damage. Vijayvargiya added, “We will hold meetings with local residents to explain that the Metro team must be allowed to work. Not even a flowerpot will be broken, everything will remain just as it is.” More about this section will be decided in detail after the company redesigns a significant route for the proposed underground track.

Small firms want govt to prioritise forex solutions,"Small Scale Business Importers and Exporters Association has appealed to the new administration to prioritise addressing foreign exchange scarcity, describing it as the backbone of the country’s economic challenges. The association’s secretary general Frank Mhango said this in Lilongwe on Friday at a time foreign exchange reserves continue to decline and are now recorded at below one month of import cover, thereby straining business operations. Briefing journalists, he warned that if businesses continue to access foreign exchange from the black market, prices of goods and services will continue to rise. Mhango said apart from medium to long-term solutions such as increasing production and securing forex inflows from development partners, the Reserve Bank of Malawi should follow up with commercial banks on how they are rationing the available forex. He claimed that some banks allocate forex to a few companies at the expense of small and medium enterprises operations. “Our message to the new administration is that they should put foreign exchange issues seriously because if we continue getting the dollar at K4 000 on black market, then things will continue to worse,” said Mhango. The group’s executive member Alfred Manda also raised outstanding taxation issues that Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) should address, including duty on tax-compliant traders. He said: “We also wanted express our commitment to ensure that our sector is formalised and that all our members should comply with Taxation Act. “We also need MRA to set standard and reasonable duty to importers because some members complain that they are being overtaxed.” In an interview on Sunday, Reserve Bank of Malawi spokesperson Boston Maliketi Banda acknowledged that short-term solutions such as demand management and currency devaluations have proven ineffective to address the foreign exchange challenges. He said the central bank is collaborating with the government, the financial industry and the private sector to prioritise and invest in productive sectors with high export potential. “The country’s persistent foreign exchange shortages are a symptom of a deep-rooted, structural imbalance. For decades, our imports have significantly exceeded our exports,” said Maliketi Banda. In a separate interview on Sunday, Financial Market Dealers Association president Leslie Fatch said reduced supply of foreign exchange has affected commercial banks’ ability to service the market, adding that rationing forex is just a reaction to the drop in supply. “Considering that structural challenges are yet to be fully addressed in the market, for now banks have to actively prioritise on which bills to be serviced with the limited resources,” he said. In August this year, RBM announced a reduction in the mandatory conversion rate for export revenues from 30 percent to 25 percent, with further reductions for qualifying companies anticipated.",2025-11-04 08:05:00,The Nation Online
Trump administration says SNAP will return after court order,"MOSCOW — Cass Davis spent the last week fishing as much as he could. He couldn’t afford not to, he said. Depending on how quickly he gets his food stamps, he might need it. “ I’ve been going salmon fishing despite the fact that I got a cold and I was miserable this morning,” he said. “ I really want to put a whole bunch of smoked salmon in my freezer.” Davis, a Moscow resident, lives on a fixed income due to disabilities. To get to his fishing spot, he barters with friends to give fishing lessons in exchange for a ride; he can’t afford the gas. Davis is one of roughly 130,000 Idahoans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. In Washington, that number is about 888,000 people. SNAP covers about $200 of Davis’ monthly groceries. He said the stress of worrying about finances has been bad for his health. “What they’ve done by taking away my food stamps is put me in a real pickle,” he said. “It’s more than I’m not eating right. I’m stressing like hell now.” On Friday, two federal judges ruled the Trump administration must use contingency funds to continue SNAP benefits. Federal Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday those benefits might resume as early as Wednesday. But other agencies who work with SNAP recipients have expressed skepticism about that timeline, stating it might take weeks for funds to come through. A representative for Idaho Health and Welfare said the agency did not have formal guidance on when SNAP benefits would be distributed. Janna Jones is the manager at the West Side Food Pantry in Moscow, operated by the nonprofit Inland Oasis. She said this month, she expects to see more families with children using the pantry. “Families have the hardest time extending their dollars,” she said. “If you’re looking at SNAP benefits, the largest population are households with children.” Roughly 36% of SNAP recipients are children, according to the Pew Research Center. The pantry held a food drive in response to the SNAP cutoff deadline Sunday. It collected 8,342 pounds of food from that drive and donations the week before. That’s a heartening sign, said volunteer Nick Koenig. “ We show up for community,” Koenig said. “We’re gonna still have our pantry doors open for you.” Still, if SNAP isn’t restored, the number of people who are on it in Moscow could roughly double the pantry’s current numbers, Koenig said. If that many people came in, the pantry would need a lot more food drives. “I think we could do a week, with what we’ve gotten thus far,” Koenig said. Even before the uncertainty with SNAP, the food pantry’s monthly use had grown from almost 1,400 in September 2022 to 2,156 this September. Two of the largest groups with increased pantry usage have been seniors and low-income people with full-time-jobs. Davis said he’s been lucky enough to be able to rely on friends who can help him out. When his van broke down last month, it cost him $1,600, some of which he had to borrow from friends. He’s now trying to pay that off. But Davis said he worries losing SNAP will put him into more debt. “ I don’t really think that people who work in Washington, D.C., really understand what ‘poor’ is,” Davis said. “People who are trying to pay rent, and pay utilities, and pay insurance, and everything that we have to — it equals no money after bills are paid.” Jessica Proctor manages the Deary Community Food Bank. She said some patrons drive from as far as Clarkia — about 30 minutes away — to use the food bank. That’s in part because until recently, it hadn’t needed to limit visitors to a certain amount of food. “We’ve gotten so little meat that we have to basically hand it out when people come in to make sure everyone gets one,” Proctor said. “Because if people panic … they’ll try to take as much as they can.” She’s also bracing for more people to need the pantry after a worse-than-average hunting season, she said. “A lot of people are dependent on elk and deer. But we have had this bluetongue disease and chronic wasting disease,” she said. Regardless of when SNAP returns, food pantry staff say there will be a continual need for donations. When donating food, Jones said, it’s especially helpful to buy flats of one staple instead of shopping for one imagined family. “Get about two things, but multiples of it. Get two or three flats of jelly and get a case of cornbread mix and bring that in,” she said. “Because what you’ve done is you have just filled the gap, and you’ve provided a more egalitarian choice for food pantries.” Jones also noted that pantries will be especially in need of donations in the new year. “People get very generous over the holidays and we really appreciate it,” she said. “People get burnt out through the holidays and by January most of the shelves start looking a little bit empty.” Most food pantries also take monetary donations to buy foods they need directly, which can help with filling unexpected needs, especially when needs are hard to predict.

Joseph (Joe) Milazzo,"Birth: 1934 Death: 2025 Joseph (“Joe”) Salvatore Milazzo passed away on October 23, 2025, one day after his 91st birthday, surrounded in love by his daughters. Born in Pittston, Pennsylvania, Joe spent the last 46 years of his life in Anaheim, California — a place he grew to love and call home. Joe was devoted to his family. He was married to his adoring wife, Anna Marie, for many years before she passed away almost six years ago. Together they built a loving home filled with warmth, laughter, and countless memories. She was the love of his life. He is survived by his daughters, Barbara Webright and Joanne Mizell, and their husbands, John Webright and Gary Mizell; his grandson, Cody Webright; his stepsons, David Spinney and Bill Spinney; and two grandchildren from his marriage to Anna Marie, Austin Spinney and Allison Rodriguez. Joe is also lovingly remembered by his nephew, Sam Milazzo; great-nephew, Jason Milazzo; great-niece, Jen Kanehl; and nieces Alice Milazzo and Sue Doty. His youngest daughter, Cathy, sadly passed away early in life, and we know they are now reunited in Heaven. Joe proudly served his country as a veteran of the Korean War. After his military service, he dedicated his life to education as a teacher in the Anaheim School District. He touched the lives of countless students over the years — not just through lessons, but through kindness, patience, and genuine care. He was a man of community and connection. Joe was a longtime member of St. Norbert Catholic Church in Orange and found joy in faith and fellowship. He was also a member of the Long Beach Speakers Club, where he shared his love of words, humor, and storytelling. He enjoyed fellowship and service as a member of First Friday Friars club. Outside of work, Joe had many passions. He loved to entertain and was always known as the most gracious and generous host. He was an avid tennis player well into his eighties and loved the energy and camaraderie of the game. He was also a voracious reader — finishing two or three books every week — always curious, always learning. Some of Joe’s happiest moments were spent right at home, sitting on his patio surrounded by friends and family, enjoying good conversation and a good cigar. He enjoyed a competitive game of Skip-Bo with family after dinner. Those simple, meaningful moments were what he treasured most. Joe was known for his generosity, his thoughtfulness, and his gentle spirit. He had a nurturing heart and was always looking after others. His weekly breakfasts with lifelong friends were a cherished tradition that lasted decades, filled with laughter and stories that only grew better with time. He was, in every sense, both a gentleman and a gentle man — kind, considerate, and full of quiet strength. Though Joe will be deeply missed, his love, wisdom, and warmth will continue to live on in all who were lucky enough to call him family and friend. Viewing will take place from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm on November 17, 2025, at Hilgenfeld Mortuary in Anaheim, California. A memorial Mass will be held at 10:00 a.m. on November 18 at St. Norbert Catholic Church in Orange, California. Send Flowers Plant a Tree Send a Meal",2025-11-04 08:05:00,Ocregister
Patrick M Mehtonen,"Birth: 1955 Death: 2025 Patrick M Mehtonen peacefully passed away October 28, 2025 in Ukiah. He was born on November 25, 1955. Pat is survived by friends and hunting buddies who have been enriched by his life and love for his ranch. He was preceded in death by his sister, Marsha; mother, Wanda Burke Mehtonen and father, Marcus Mehtonen. Pat grew up as a traditional Mendocino County rancher. Raising sheep, hunting, riding horses, and living off the land as much as possible. Over the years, as it became harder to make a living on sheep alone, he was able to turn his passion for hunting into a livelihood. Never one to need luxury, he lived his entire life on his ranch where he considered it the greatest place on Earth, constantly working to keep everything running as only a rancher could. He was tough as nails, never complained, and could fix anything with baling wire and whatever he could find laying around. He didn’t just love his ranch it was his life and his legacy, having begun as a homestead by his maternal grandfather William P. Burke in the late 1800s. According to family lore, the Burke’s were the first people to find a way to bring a covered wagon into Ukiah Valley. That toughness and determination was a trait Pat certainly inherited. His greatest joy was spending time at his cabin, eating, drinking, hunting, laughing, and sharing memories and experiences with anyone who would join him. Although he never had children of his own, being a father figure came naturally to him. He was a role model to many, and everyone who spent time with him learned how to enjoy a simplified life. His sense of humor and spontaneity was always on full display and a joy to be around. The Mehtonen Ranch will live on and be a place to carry on the tradition of his family his biggest ambition. Pat’s one-of-a-kind personality, humor, jokes, and love for his ranch and hunting will forever be missed and never forgotten. So many cherished memories to reflect upon. A celebration of life will be hosted by the Crudo family at Mike & Teresa Crudo’s home on Sunday, November 16th at one o’clock. Bring your stories and photos to share.

Eagles vs Packers Predictions - Early Picks & Odds for Monday Night Football Week 10,"Ponnaiya's prediction: Hurts delivers at Lambeau. The Philadelphia Eagles lock horns with the Green Bay Packers in Monday Night Football in Week 10. The Eagles are fresh off their bye after back-to-back wins, while the Pacers are coming off an upset loss on Sunday. My early Eagles vs. Packers predictions are expecting a lower-scoring game while backing Philadelphia as a short road underdog. Here are my NFL picks for this Monday Night showdown. Here are our early thoughts on the spread and total for this week’s game. We will have a full game preview (with a best bet and SGP) later in the week. -110 at bet365 The Philadelphia Eagles are 6-2 and won back-to-back games before going on their bye in Week 9. The week off should have allowed superstar running back Saquon Barkley and No. 1 wide receiver A.J. Brown to recover from niggling injuries. Philadelphia's offense is trending in the right direction. Jalen Hurts has completed 71.1% of his passes for 1068 yards with 10 touchdowns and one pick over the last four games. Meanwhile, Barkley finally broke out with 150 rushing yards in Week 8. The Green Bay Packers were 13.5-point favorites last week but ended up falling 16-13 to the Panthers. They lost tight end Tucker Kraft to a season-ending injury in that game, which is yet another blow to a banged-up receiver group. Quarterback Jordan Love has been trying to do too much, which has resulted in holding on to the ball too long and some bad throws. With so many of his top targets sidelined, he'll have a tough time throwing against a Philly D that is fourth in the league in opponent pass rating. Especially with the Eagles bolstering their pass rush by trading for Jaelen Phillips. -110 at bet365 With the season-ending injury to Kraft, Jayden Reed on the IR, and rookie wideout Matthew Golden dealing with a shoulder injury, Green Bay's offense will have a tough time moving the ball through the air. That said, the Packers have a strong pass defense themselves, ranking eighth in the league in defensive dropback success rate. They are allowing just 16.3 ppg at home, and even in last week's upset loss to the Panthers, their defense showed up. These teams will have to lean on their rushing attacks if they want to move the chains on Monday. That will be even more emphasized in a cold-weather game with temperatures expected to be close to freezing at Lambeau. Both offenses play at a slow tempo, with Green Bay 26th in the league in seconds per play and Philadelphia 30th. That sluggish pace and a reliance on running the ball should lead to the clock getting chewed up and the Under cashing.

Sticker shock? Wyomingites could see skyrocketing bills on ACA health insurance marketplace,"When the Affordable Care Act marketplace, where roughly 42,000 Wyoming residents get their health insurance, opened enrollment Saturday, customers likely faced a double whammy: higher prices and fewer resources. The landscape looks different this year between federal changes to the marketplace’s administration and the ongoing government shutdown — caused in part by a deadlock over ACA tax credits designed to make insurance cheaper for consumers. As things stand, consumers are generally experiencing less help in navigating the system, seeing higher premium costs for plans and facing new reporting requirements. In some cases, people could find their health insurance costs spiking by thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars annually. Wyomingites have two months to shop for a plan before open enrollment closes Jan. 15. WyoFile reached out to experts and gathered information and tips for residents to keep in mind through the process: The Affordable Care Act marketplace is available to people who don’t qualify for Medicaid and don’t have insurance through an employer. Open enrollment is the annual window when individuals and families can sign up for health insurance through the ACA, adjust their plans or cancel coverage. Price jumps aren’t uncommon as insurers do raise premiums over time, but this year those increases will be larger due to the expiration of some enhanced premium tax credits. “Health insurance has always been and continues to be very, very expensive,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor with Georgetown’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. “But going into 2026, it’s only going to get more expensive.” The tax credits were created in 2021 to essentially lower monthly out-of-pocket costs for ACA consumers, in some cases, all the way to $0. Congress did not extend them in the One Big Beautiful Bill in July, and an attempt to extend them now is one of the factors driving the government shutdown. The average ACA marketplace consumer will likely pay about 100% more for coverage in 2026, according to a fact sheet from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. In Wyoming, the impacts will vary depending on income, demographics and other factors. According to Healthy Wyoming, a 60-year-old couple with an annual income of $82,000 will face an increase of $37,422 in annual health care costs due to the tax credit loss. The premium increase for a 45-year-old who earns $62,000 annually could be upwards of $6,000. In the past, health “navigators” — professionals who guide customers through what can be a confusing open enrollment process — have been available largely thanks to federal funds. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, however, slashed that funding by 90% this year. As a result, Enroll Wyoming, which offered free navigator help to those looking for insurance, experienced a significant budget cut. Despite paring down its staff from 10 individuals to just one full-time and one part-time employee, Enroll Wyoming will still offer services. “Enroll Wyoming stresses that it will be still around to educate and empower consumers,” reads an August press release. The nonprofit will have more emphasis on online and phone communication in its new iteration, the release says. “At the same time, Enroll Wyoming is building a statewide network of partners to provide more referral support.” Consumers will also have fewer options. Mountain Health Co-op announced in August that it will no longer offer health plans in Wyoming at the end of the year. That means Wyoming will be down to just two providers. Finally, people should brace for more paperwork, Corlette said. That can include filing extra forms or submitting paperwork to reflect any changes in income. Enrollment opened Saturday. To get coverage starting Jan. 1, consumers must enroll in a plan by Dec. 15. If they enroll between Dec. 15 and the closing date of Jan. 15, coverage will start Feb. 1. If people are already enrolled and do nothing, they will be automatically re-enrolled in their plans. The ACA marketplace only opened up what’s called “window shopping” two days before enrollment began, Corlette said, which means that it’s been hard for customers to suss out their new options. “Also, the federal government told insurance companies that for this year only, they don’t have to include premium information in the notices that they send to consumers, which usually go out in October,” she added. That could further veil price changes. “I can imagine some people will be taken by surprise,” she said. “This will be a uniquely challenging year.” First, Corlette said, they can contact their members of Congress to urge them to find more affordable solutions and let them know “the delay is not helping anyone.” Next, she said, they should stay informed. “If you see your premium is unaffordable, don’t lose hope. There is still a chance that Congress will strike a deal here and provide premium relief.” Folks can hold off until Dec. 15, Corlette noted; they don’t have to rush into anything. If they do decide to leave the marketplace and look elsewhere, Corlette said, they should have caution. “There’s a lot of junk out there and a lot of aggressive marketing, so just be careful,” she said, adding that using a local insurance broker who can meet in person is generally a good way to help sort the quality plans from those that don’t offer much financial protection. What Corlette fears at this point is that “a lot of people will check their accounts, see their premium, get sticker shock, and say, ‘I can’t afford this,’ and walk away. “And once they walk away, it’s really, really hard to get them to come back,” she said. “I think there’s still time for Congress to act, but probably too late to be sure that everybody stays insured.” If people opt out of marketplace insurance, it would likely trigger even more cost increases. According to BlueCrossBlueShield Wyoming, when healthier people leave the marketplace, those who remain often require more care. That drives up costs for everyone.

Murphy's Taproom closes after 19 years in Manchester,"Murphy’s Taproom on Elm Street in Manchester is permanently closed. Murphy’s Taproom has been a mainstay of Elm Street in Manchester since it took over the Omega Entertainment Complex in 2007. Now, it’s no more after the owners decided to consolidate operatons at their Bedford facility. The Irish-themed restaurant and pub closed at the end of last month. Keith Murphy opened the joint after working as a manager at The Derryfield restaurant and at a restaurant in Baltimore. The taproom later expanded, and Murphy added a diner after purchasing a vacant auto mechanic’s shop. Murphy later sold the diner. Murphy, who serves as a state senator representing Manchester’s Ward 1, said it was tough to close a restaurant he invested in for 19 years. “It was a successful long run,” Murphy said. “Nineteen years is a lifetime in the restaurant business.” He said the “old saying is half of them don’t make it the first year.” He admits he doesn’t know if it’s true or not. Murphy’s owns its spot in Bedford while it rented in Manchester all these years. “When we looked at what made sense in the long term, the building that we owned made a lot more sense,” he said. The growth of new apartments in and around Manchester didn’t necessarily translate into new business, especially a place that made 50% of its profit on alcohol with trends showing people are drinking less in recent years. Pizza, burgers, and beers paid the bills. The Bedford location opened in 2017 after the team behind Murphy’s bought the Weathervane Seafood Restaurant on Route 101 in Bedford and tore it down. The venue includes a function hall. Unlike Manchester, which serves homemade bar food, Bedford has more high-end options, such as steak and seafood dishes. No changes are on the horizon for the Bedford location. “What we are doing in Bedford works very good for us,” Murphy said. “We have been busier and busier and our trendline is very good for us.” The closure of the Manchester location also made sense for Murphy’s family life. He hopes regulars will make the trek to Bedford. “For us it was a simple math equation,” Murphy said. “The place in Bedford is very busy and we’re home by 9 p.m. most nights.” jphelps@unionleader.com Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

Analysis: Obamacare is still on Trump’s mind — but outlook appears doubtful,"President Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on Jan. 20, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images/TNS) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump still has Barack Obama’s signature legislative accomplishment on his mind, but the political calendar and environment are not on his side. Pushing a measure to revise — or even replace — the 2010 health care law known as the Affordable Care Act as the nation heads into what will likely be a contentious midterm election year would be among the biggest battles of his turbulent decade-old political career.

The Slot machine is up and running again as record-equalling Liverpool sink Real,"Alexis Mac Allister's second-half header proved decisive as a revitalised Liverpool deservedly defeated Real Madrid 1-0 at Anfield to equal a Champions League record. In a closely-contested first half with chances at both ends of the field, one controversial moment stood out - one that went against the Premier League champions. The Reds were first awarded a free kick when Dominik Szoboszlai's shot struck Aurelien Tchouameni's hand right on the line, but after a pitchside review, Liverpool were not given a penalty, but the handball call itself was overturned. The home faithful would have felt that justice was served just past the hour mark, though, as one of the smallest men on the pitch - Mac Allister - beat the hitherto impenetrable Thibaut Courtois with a bullet header to break the deadlock. Arne Slot's steadfast defence quelled Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior expertly to trigger Anfield jubilation, and also equal the record for the most European Cup/Champions League wins over Real Madrid to nil with five, the same number as Juventus. Fifth-placed Real remain above Liverpool in the 36-team table, but only goal difference is keeping Los Blancos above the sixth-placed Reds, who have won back-to-back matches for the first time since September 23. We were not sure if Liverpool were back after their win over Aston Villa. Liverpool have just beaten Real Madrid, and quite convincingly at that. They are back. Tonight, the statistics and the eye test told the story on Merseyside, where the Reds generated 2.58 Expected Goals compared to Real's 0.45, and the 15-time European champions managed just two shots on target all evening long. Courtois was near-unbeatable in goal for most of the evening, but the ex-Chelsea shot-stopper was let down by his outfielders in white, and it was only too fitting for Mac Allister to grab the decisive goal and continue his redemption arc after a troubled start to the new term. Of course, the right-back dynamic cannot be ignored either; while Trent Alexander-Arnold watched on from the bench for most of the match and was then booed vociferously during his short time on the pitch, Conor Bradley had Vinicius in his pocket. Tuesday's loss was just Real's second in 15 matches this season, but Xabi Alonso's crop were inferior throughout, and the corner appears to have been well and truly turned for the Premier League holders. Was it a handball!? ? Liverpool are denied a penalty after VAR review ❌ pic.twitter.com/CLesyTkPDj What would Liverpool vs. Real Madrid be without a little bit of controversy? Referee Istvan Kovacs initially gives a free kick just outside the box for an Tchouameni handball before being summoned to the monitor, triggering cheers from expectant Liverpool fans. However, following a review, the Romanian decides that Tchouameni did not commit a handball offence after all. The home crowd thought their side were going to be awarded a penalty - they do not even get a free kick! Mac Allister breaks the deadlock! ? No saving that one for Courtois as Liverpool's pressure pays off ? pic.twitter.com/OFY3iTX2BY Courtois is beaten by a header from Mac Allister. Who had that one on their bingo card for tonight? Szoboszlai's outswinging free kick is drilled in to the mixer, and Mac Allister peels away from white shirts to steer a powerful header home into the roof of the net above Courtois's flailing arms. A VAR check briefly disrupts the hosts' celebrations, but Mac Allister is clearly being played onside by Jude Bellingham, and the goal stands. Thibaut Courtois is having a BLINDER vs Liverpool ? Where have we seen that before? ?⏮️ pic.twitter.com/Hz38Gm3gJS Picking a Real Madrid player for this award almost feels wrong, but just as he did in the 2021-22 UCL final, Courtois repelled Liverpool attack after Liverpool attack. The Belgian's efforts were in vain this time, but with eight saves, 10 recoveries, three successful run-outs and two clearances, Real Madrid would have easily lost by more were it not for one of the best goalkeepers of this generation. Possession: Liverpool 39%-61% Real Madrid Shots: Liverpool 17-8 Real Madrid Shots on target: Liverpool 9-2 Real Madrid Corners: Liverpool 4-2 Real Madrid Fouls: Liverpool 16-11 Real Madrid Florian Wirtz created five chances against Real Madrid in the first half.

Chargers’ Henley plays through grief after brother’s death,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Daiyan Henley, a former Washington State star, started and played Sunday because football is his escape, and he needed that more than ever after the shooting death of his older brother. Henley came through with seven tackles, his third sack of the season, a tackle for loss and a quarterback hit in the Chargers’ 27-20 win over the Tennessee Titans. “Right now, I’m just floating and the only thing that’s consistent right now in my life, and this is crazy to say, is football,” Henley said after the game. “So for me, that’s why I’m out there is because this is the most consistent thing I’ve got in my life right now is football. And I’m just trying to make the most of it.” His older brother, Jabari, was killed Friday night in Los Angeles. Henley traveled with the Chargers and started. According to ESPN, Henley heard the news after he was awoken Saturday morning in his hotel room by teammate Denzel Perryman, who urged him to call his mother. “Being transparent, I dropped to my knees,” Henley said. Henley was the Chargers’ third-round pick in 2023 out of WSU, and he has started every game since the start of the 2024 season. Henley’s father is record executive Eugene “Big U” Henley who has worked with many prominent West Coast rappers, including Snoop Dogg, Kurupt and the late Nipsey Hussle. The elder Henley also helped produce and was featured in the 2021 FX documentary series “Hip Hop Uncovered.” His father also is a former gang leader who was arrested in a drug sting and served 12 years of a 23-year sentence. The Chargers linebacker posted “Love you big bro” on social media after the game. It’s been a challenging year for Henley who played through illness in a 20-9 win over the Las Vegas Raiders in the second game of the season. He said the Chargers’ organization has been there for him from ownership on down, and Henley credited coach Jim Harbaugh with being there for him repeatedly. “He’s probably been the first call I’ve gotten for every situation,” Henley said. “He’s been there, right there and just told me, keep my head down, keep grinding, keep working, and try to stay consistent.”",2025-11-05 08:05:00,Dnews
Frank Dunn,"Birth: 1936 Death: 2025 Frank Wyatt Dunn, a man whose hands shaped more than just tools and machines, passed away peacefully on October 25, 2025, at the age of 89. His life was defined not only by what he built, but by how he built it–with care, integrity, and a deep sense of purpose. Born on February 18, 1936, Frank was a natural builder. He could make, repair, and maintain almost anything–from farm equipment to household fixtures. But his true gift lay in constructing the foundations of lasting relationships, thriving businesses, and community organizations. His work was never just about the task at hand–it was about the people it served and the legacy it left behind. Frank spent forty years as the general manager of a leading agronomy research facility, where he oversaw pioneering efforts in selective breeding to improve crop resilience and yield. His leadership helped advance sustainable agriculture and supported generations of farmers and scientists. Though he once patented a clover harvester in 1978, a testament to his ingenuity, Frank’s life’s work was far broader. He was a lifelong member and leader of the Lions Club, where he served with distinction, including as District Governor in 1991. His service was marked by humility and a tireless commitment to helping others. Frank shared over 64 joyful years of marriage with his beloved wife, Marilee Dunn, who passed just six months before him. Their partnership was the cornerstone of a life filled with love, laughter, and shared purpose. He is survived by his two sons, Mike and David; his daughter-in-law Cathy; his grandsons Ryan and Will; and Ryan’s wife, Jessa. Frank was eagerly awaiting the arrival of his first great-grandchild this coming February–a new life he hoped to welcome with the same warmth and wisdom he gave so freely. A celebration of Frank’s life will be held on Tuesday, November 25 at 12:00 PM at the Woodland Lion Banquet Hall. All who knew him are invited to gather and honor the man who built so much and gave even more. Frank led by example, touching and changing the lives of everyone he encountered. His legacy is not just in what he made, but in what he made possible. Send Flowers Plant a Tree Send a Meal",2025-11-05 08:05:00,Daily Democrat
Limp Bizkit bassist Sam Rivers was found dead in pool of blood: report,"Late Limp Bizkit bassist Sam Rivers was found dead in a blood-stained bathroom earlier last month, according to a new report on Oct 30. Photo: TNS Late Limp Bizkit bassist Sam Rivers was found dead in a blood-stained bathroom earlier last month, according to a new report on Oct 30. Per a recording of the 911 call obtained by TMZ, a woman identified only as Keely told a dispatcher she discovered Rivers “face first in a pile of blood” in a bathroom at his Florida home. She can be heard attempting to perform CPR during the call as she sobs into the phone. Responding officers from the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Department also performed CPR before paramedics arrived and pronounced Rivers dead. The 48-year-old musician appeared to have a cut above his eye, suggesting he may have suffered a fall, according to an incident report also obtained by TMZ. A deputy noted Rivers’ face and neck were blue – common symptoms of a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot that blocks and stops blood flow to the lungs. However, his cause of death has still not been determined. It was previously reported that Rivers was under medical care at home at the time of his death. According to the incident report, Keely told deputies that Rivers underwent a liver transplant in 2018 and was taking related medication. He temporarily left Limp Bizkit in 2015 after developing liver disease from years of excessive drinking. “I had to leave Limp Bizkit in 2015 because I felt so horrible, and a few months after that I realised I had to change everything because I had really bad liver disease,” Rivers told author Jon Wiederhorn for his book Raising Hell. “I got treatment for the alcohol and got a liver transplant, which was a perfect match,” he said. He returned to the band in 2018, the same year as his transplant. Rivers co-founded Limp Bizkit in the 1990s alongside frontman Fred Durst. Several of the band’s songs have seen a recent surge in streams, including 1999’s Break Stuff, which topped Billboard’s Hot Hard Rock Songs list just this week. As of Oct 30, Limp Bizkit was still slated to embark on their Central and South American Gringo Papi tour, kicking off Nov 29 in Mexico City. The seven-date, seven-country tour is scheduled to end Dec 20 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. – New York Daily News/Tribune News Service Thank you for your report!",2025-11-05 08:05:00,The Star
Point and Funds Managed by Blue Owl Capital Close Oversubscribed $390 Million Home Equity Investment Rated Securitization,"Palo Alto, California, Nov. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Point, the leading home equity investment platform making homeownership more valuable and accessible, and funds managed by Blue Owl Capital (“Blue Owl”) announced today that they have completed a rated securitization of Point’s Home Equity Investment (“HEI”) assets, issuing $390 million of rated asset-backed securities (the “Transaction”), marking Point’s third securitization of 2025 and continuing the firm’s record of programmatic issuance. The Transaction closed on October 28th, 2025. The issuer, Point Securitization Trust 2025-2, issued $254.2 million of senior class A-1 securities rated A (low) (sf), $46.6 million of mezzanine class A-2 securities rated BBB (low) (sf), $45.9 million of subordinate class B-1 securities rated BB (low) (sf), and $43.3 million of subordinate class B-2 securities rated B (high) (sf) (retained), all rated by Morningstar DBRS. A portion of the notes was acquired by accounts managed by an affiliate of Blue Owl. The Transaction attracted 29 unique investors, including eight new entrants to the Point securitization platform, resulting in over $1.6 billion in orders, and underscoring the continued institutional interest and confidence in Point’s program. Co-sponsoring the Transaction with a subsidiary of Blue Owl, Point was the originator of all the HEIs in the securitization and will continue to service the assets. In addition to complying with U.S. credit risk retention rules, the Transaction is the first HEI securitization to include undertakings related to both the EU Securitization Regulation and the UK Securitization Framework, as well as the transparency requirements of the EU Securitization Regulation. These steps further position Point’s securitization platform to meet the standards of European and UK institutional investors, reflecting Point’s commitment to broadening global access to the HEI market. “Building on the strong momentum of PNT 25-1, this transaction reflects growing confidence in home equity investments as a mainstream asset class,” said Eddie Lim, co-founder and CEO of Point. “As homeowners and investors continue to seek flexible, sustainable ways to unlock and deploy capital, Point is proud to lead with consistency, transparency, and execution.” Since pioneering the HEI category in 2015, Point has closed six securitizations and continues to set benchmarks for liquidity, scalability, and transparency in alternative home equity financing. “This marks the third transaction that Blue Owl has co-sponsored alongside Point. We were able to combine legacy seasoned collateral we acquired earlier this year with new originations purchased directly from Point to issue the largest public HEI securitization to date,” said Ivan Zinn, Head of Alternative Credit at Blue Owl. “Blue Owl and Point have a longstanding relationship dating back to 2018, and we are excited to continue working with the Point team.” Barclays Capital Inc. (“Barclays”) was the sole-structuring agent for the issuance. Barclays, Nomura Securities International Inc., and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. were joint bookrunners on the Transaction, and East West Markets, LLC and StoneX Financial Inc. were co-managers on the Transaction.

Ellen Murdoch Wheeler,"Birth: 1930 Death: 2025 Ellen Murdoch Wheeler entered into eternal rest on Tuesday, October 28th, 2025 in Portage, Indiana. She is survived by her children, Ellen Ann Lopiano, Janet M. Wheeler, and Scott M. Wheeler; 15 grandchildren, 22 great-grandchildren, and 2 great-great-great-grandchildren. She was preceded in death by her beloved husband of 49 years, Arthur J. Wheeler, and two sons, Stephen A. Wheeler and Mark E. Wheeler. Born to Scottish immigrant parents, Archibald and Margaret B. Murdoch of Warwick, Rhode Island, she was the youngest of five. She aspired to become a seamstress and was a part-time secretary at Brown University. This changed when she met her husband, Arthur, a volunteer fireman and eventual sheet metal worker. The couple were wed in the living room of Ellen’s childhood home on July 2nd, 1949. After starting their family, they moved to Orange County, California. Ellen embraced life as a homemaker, mother, and devout Christian. Later, Ellen joined the ranks of the Yorba Linda mail carriers as one of their first female mailmen. After retirement, the couple moved to Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Sadly, Arthur passed in 1998. Ellen chose to remain for three decades in Lake Havasu and was involved at St. Michael’s United Methodist Church. During this time, she also cared for her sister Janet Fisher and her adult son Stephen, both passed from dementia. She then moved to be with family, living briefly in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, before settling in Indiana with her daughter, Janet, and grandson Frank Spennato. Reading and cryptograms were Ellen’s favorite pass times. She could buy out a bookstore. Ellen also continued to sew and knit. Her children and grandchildren could often be found wearing the latest Ellen fashion. Ellen was known as a spitfire, a straight shooter, and perhaps a little mischievous. She’d be the first to say she was no saint. But one thing was certain, everyone held deep respect for her. Above all, she was known for her love, because when she loved, she loved fiercely. A public memorial service will be held on Saturday, November 22nd at 2:00pm at St. Michael’s United Methodist Church in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. All are welcome. There will be a reception to follow in the church hall, and flowers are appreciated. Please RSVP to ellenwheelermemorial@gmail.com if you plan to attend by November 15th.
