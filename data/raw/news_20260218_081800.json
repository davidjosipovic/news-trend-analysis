WWE wrestler and YouTuber Paul bought the card for $5.275 million in 2021, which broke the standing record at the time. He also wore the card with a custom holder and chain for his 2022 Wrestlemania debut.Paul asked for $1.3 million when the card was put on auction in January. He stated he will hand-deliver the card to the auction winner. The online auction house Goldin facilitated the bidding. Bids quickly rose to $4.5 million during the first week, but leveled out to $5.1 million by January 14. Dozens of bids came in during the last 24 hours the card was on auction, driving up the price to $13.3 million with a 24% buyer's fee. A Guinness World Record Adjudicator was present to verify that the purchase made it the highest selling trading card ever recorded.
