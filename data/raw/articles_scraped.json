Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More If you've been hoping for another RBA interest rate cut this year, the economists at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) have some bad news for you. CBA revised its outlook for rate relief Down Under following yesterday's widely unexpected surge in inflation. News which sent the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) into a tailspin in early afternoon trade on Wednesday. The prospect of ASX 200 investors or Aussie mortgage holders seeing another 2025 interest rate cut from the RBA all but vanished yesterday after the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicator rose 1.3% in the September quarter and 3.2% annually. That marks the highest quarterly inflation increase since March 2023 and was well ahead of market expectations. The annual inflation print was the highest level since the June 2024 quarter. As for trimmed mean annual inflation, which removes certain volatile items and is the metric favoured by the RBA, it came in at 3% for the September quarter, up from 2.7% in the June quarter. This was the first time trimmed mean annual inflation rose since December 2022, and it came in well above the RBA's forecast of 2.6%. Which brings us to… Commenting on the surprise surge in inflation, Belinda Allen, head of Australian economics at CBA, said, \"This result will be a genuine concern for the RBA. We expect the central bank to take a more hawkish tone to avoid a return to higher inflation.\" The RBA meets next week and announces its interest rate decision on Tuesday. As for that upcoming meeting, CBA said, \"We expect the cash rate to be held steady at 3.60%.\" Unfortunately for ASX investors patiently waiting until 2026 for the next rate cuts, CBA also believes those are off the table for now. According to the ASX 200 bank: Given the material upside surprise to the Q3 25 CPI, and the broad-based nature of pricing pressures, we now expect the RBA to remain on hold from here. Previously we expected one last rate cut in February 2026 to bring the cash rate back closer to neutral. So, what will it take for Aussie to get some rate relief? \"We expect it would take a material move higher in the unemployment rate, together with more moderate inflation prints, to bring the RBA back to the cutting table,\" CBA said. Could, gasp, the next RBA interest rate move actually be higher? According to CBA, that's certainly a possibility, with the bank noting \"the latest data has tilted the risks to the upside\". CBA concluded, \"If inflation remains elevated in 2026, as we expect it could, the RBA may need to act.\"",

    "title": "Business : Xi Jinping Urges Partnership With Us, Says Frictions Are 'normal' Between Economic Powers",
    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 30 (Bernama) -- China and the United States (US) should be partners and friends, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his meeting with his counterpart Donald Trump at the Gimhae Air Base in Busan, South Korea, while stating that it is normal for two economic powerhouses to have frictions at times. Trump called Xi a great leader, “President Xi is a great leader of a great country, and I think we are going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it is an honour to have you with us. Thank you very much.” Xi said, “China’s relations have remained stable on the whole (and) given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then and in the face of winds, waves and challenges.” “You and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course and ensure the steady sailing forward of the giant ship of China-US relations. I always believe that China’s development goes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again,” he said in the video that was streamed live by The White House. Xi said both leaders have spoken over the phone three times, exchanged several letters, and stayed in close contact since Trump’s re-election. He said both Beijing and Washington are fully able to help each other succeed and prosper together. “Over the years, I have stated in public many times that China and the US should be partners and friends. This is what history has taught us and what reality demands,” Xi said. Xi said that in the latest round of consultation, both economic and trade teams have reached a basic consensus on addressing respective major concerns and made encouraging progress. Earlier in his opening remarks, Trump also mentioned the consensus that has been reached. “I think we have already agreed to a lot of things, and we will agree to some more right now,” said Trump. Xi said the consensus provided the necessary conditions for their meeting today. He said, “Mr President, I am ready to continue working with you to build a solid foundation for China-US relations and create a sound atmosphere for the development of both countries.” Meanwhile, Trump also said Xi is a “very tough negotiator”, and a China-US trade deal could be signed between the two countries. Xi also expressed his appreciation for Trump’s contribution to the recent conclusion of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. “Mr President, you care a lot about world peace, and you are very enthusiastic about settling various regional hotspot issues. I appreciate your great contribution to the recent conclusion of the Gaza ceasefire agreement,” he said. The Chinese President also mentioned the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord, signed in Kuala Lumpur by Cambodia and Thailand. He said China has been helping, in its own way, for both countries to settle their border disputes, and that it has also been promoting peace talks to resolve other hotspot issues. “The world today is confronted with many tough problems. China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world,” he said. Both leaders are in South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Week, which is taking place in Gyeongju, a coastal city. Malaysia is a founding member of APEC, an intergovernmental forum comprising 21 economies. Collectively, the APEC economies contribute approximately 61 per cent of global gross domestic product and 46 per cent of world trade, underscoring their pivotal role in driving international economic growth and integration. With a population exceeding three billion, the APEC region continues to serve as a key engine of global development and is projected to expand by 2.9 per cent in 2026, reflecting its resilience and enduring economic potential. -- BERNAMA BERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\n\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial © 2025 BERNAMA  \n      • Disclaimer  \n      • Privacy Policy  \n      • Security Policy",

    "text": "African glass bead art has been a part of cultural expression for centuries, combining traditional techniques with modern aesthetics.\nThis art form has evolved, yet retained its roots, showcasing the rich heritage and creativity of African artisans.\nFrom intricate patterns to vibrant colors, glass bead art continues to captivate audiences worldwide.\nHere are five fascinating aspects of this unique artistic tradition. #1 Glass beads have been a part of African culture since ancient times. They were used for trade, adornment, and spiritual purposes.\n    The introduction of European-made glass beads in the 15th century revolutionized the industry, making them more accessible.\n    Today, these beads are still used in traditional ceremonies and contemporary fashion alike. #2 The art of bead-making is passed down generations, with artisans perfecting their craft over the years.\n    Traditional techniques include melting raw materials and shaping them into small spheres or tubes.\n    Modern innovations have introduced new colors and shapes, but the basic methods remain largely unchanged. #3 Each design in African glass bead art carries cultural significance.\n    Patterns may depict social status, tribal affiliation, or personal identity.\n    Colors also have meanings; for example, red may symbolize strength, while blue could represent peace.\n    Understanding these symbols adds depth to appreciating this art form. #4 The production and sale of glass beads provide a source of income for many communities across Africa.\n    Artisans often work in cooperatives that support fair trade practices and sustainable development initiatives.\n    The global demand for authentic African beadwork helps preserve this tradition while contributing to local economies. #5 In recent years, there has been a resurgence in popularity for African glass bead jewelry among fashion enthusiasts around the world.\n    Designers are incorporating these vibrant pieces into modern wardrobes, highlighting their versatility as both statement accessories and subtle embellishments.\n    This trend not only celebrates cultural heritage but also encourages ethical consumerism through supporting artisan communities.",

    "title": "Fed Meeting: Second Rate Cut Of The Year Announced, Benchmark Rates Lowered By 0.25%",
    "text": "The U.S. Federal Reserve just cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percent, which lines up with what most people on Wall Street expected. It's the second time they've trimmed rates this year, dropping the policy range to 3.75 to 4 percent. The vote wasn't unanimous either—out of twelve members, ten wanted this cut, one didn’t want any change, and another actually wanted an even bigger cut of 0.5 percent. The Fed didn’t give much of a hint about what they're planning for December. Back in September, they said there could be three more cuts in 2025, but for now, everyone’s waiting for the next meeting in December. After the announcement, markets bounced around—stocks jumped at first, then got shaky after the Fed Chair made his comments. So, what does the Fed say about the economy? In their official statement, they said things are still growing, but not too fast. Job growth is slowing down, and unemployment has ticked up a bit, though it’s still low. Inflation is higher than it was at the start of the year and isn’t coming down yet. The Fed keeps pointing to its two big goals: keeping unemployment low and hitting that 2 percent inflation target. Lately, with job risks creeping up, they decided a 0.25 percent rate cut was the right move to balance things out. They’re keeping a close eye on economic trends and global issues before making any more decisions. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke, markets got even more jittery. He said there’s a lot of disagreement inside the Fed about what to do in December, and it’s just too soon to say if there will be another cut this year. Stocks, which had gone up right after the rate cut, quickly lost those gains as investors digested his remarks. One more wrinkle: a government shutdown has held up a bunch of important economic reports. Even with some data missing, the Fed said they had enough information from both public and private sources to make the call. The shutdown has made it harder for agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect data. The White House warned that if this drags on, key inflation reports could be delayed, which could mess with how everyone judges the economy.",

    "title": "Asian Stocks Erase Gains After Trump-Xi Talks, Yen Falls: Markets Wrap",
    "text": "US equity-index futures erased gains and Asian shares lost momentum after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping ended their summit that was aimed at easing the trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Contracts for the S&P 500 were flat after the underlying gauge erased gains following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s warning that a rate cut in December isn’t a foregone conclusion. Asian shares gave up earlier gains to trade 0.1% lower. The technology sector remained in focus after Samsung Electronics Co.’s earnings beat estimates, and megacap US companies boosted bets on the artificial intelligence theme. The yen fluctuated against the dollar after the Bank of Japan held its policy rate. Gold was flat after four days of declines, while a gauge of the dollar trimmed gains from the prior session. Treasuries recouped some of their losses with the yield on the 10-year declining one basis point to 4.06%. Markets are looking past the Fed’s cautious stance on further rate cuts and turning their focus to the ongoing Trump–Xi meeting, which investors hope will ease the world’s largest trade dispute and steady global markets after months of tension. The artificial intelligence theme and spending by megacap companies were also in focus as big technology names started reporting earnings. Trump earlier said the US and China “could” sign a trade deal Thursday as the two leaders started a high-stakes meeting. The two leaders were set to finalise a détente at their South Korea meeting to put the world’s biggest trade fight on hold — at least for now. Earlier, following the Fed’s expected rate cut, Powell’s caution about future moves and his focus on labor market risks led investors to scale back easing bets. Fed officials delivered their second straight rate reduction Wednesday to support a softening labor market, and said they would stop shrinking the portfolio of assets on Dec. 1. Governor Stephen Miran dissented again in favor of a larger reduction. Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid said he preferred not to cut rates at all. Investors also got a chance to price in tech companies spending on artificial intelligence after earnings from megacaps. Three bellwethers – Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — together racked up some $78 billion in capital expenditures last quarter. That’s up 89% from a year earlier. Their earnings were mixed. Meta Platforms shares fell 7.4% in extended trading while Alphabet jumped 6.7%. Microsoft fell almost 4%. Earlier in the US trading day, Nvidia Corp. became the first company to reach $5 trillion in market valuation. “Even though the Fed communication was more hawkish than the market had expected, the news of Nvidia’s market cap exceeding $5 trillion and Alphabet’s favorable earnings announcement are supporting tech-related stocks in Asia,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. Some of the main moves in markets: S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% as of 1:16 p.m. Tokyo time Japan’s Topix rose 0.3% Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.5% Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.5% The Shanghai Composite was little changed Euro Stoxx 50 futures rose 0.2% The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1% The euro rose 0.2% to $1.1625 The Japanese yen was little changed at 152.74 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.0957 per dollar Bitcoin fell 1.4% to $109,904.42 Ether fell 1.8% to $3,881.47 The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 4.06% Japan’s 10-year yield was unchanged at 1.655% Australia’s 10-year yield advanced seven basis points to 4.29% West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.4% to $60.22 a barrel Spot gold rose 0.3% to $3,942.76 an ounce",

Earlier, the Department of Foreign Affairs said four outcome documents are expected to be secured during the Summit. Apart from the APEC activities, Marcos will also meet with members of the Filipino community in Busan. He will also have meetings with various business leaders and executives, which are expected to boost manufacturing and semiconductor investments.

    "title": "‘Friction Is Natural, But Ties Must Stay On Track’: Xi Jinping Urges Trump For China-US Partnership",
    "text": "Chinese President Xi Jinping met his American counterpart Donald Trump in South Korea on Thursday, marking their first meeting in six years. During the talks, Xi emphasised that Beijing and Washington must remain partners and friends, acknowledging that differences were “natural” but urging both nations to stay on the “right course.” “It is natural to have friction,” Xi said, adding, “China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish more great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world.” He also expressed appreciation for Trump’s efforts to promote peace in ongoing global conflicts, reiterating China’s willingness to continue working with the United States. In response, President Trump described Xi as “a great leader of a great country,” adding, “I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it's an honour to have you with us.” The two leaders met at an air base in the southern port city of Busan, with the encounter taking place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. This was also the first meeting since Trump’s return to office in January this year. As the two leaders shook hands, Trump remarked, “We are going to have a very successful meeting, I have no doubt. But he is a very tough negotiator.” The meeting came against the backdrop of renewed US-China trade tensions, which have persisted since 2018. The dispute reignited earlier this month after China proposed expanding curbs on exports of rare-earth minerals, a key component for high-tech manufacturing where Beijing holds global dominance. In response, Trump announced plans to impose additional 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods and hinted at further restrictions on exports involving US software - a move that analysts warned could severely disrupt the global economy. Following urgent negotiations between senior officials, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Beijing might delay the rare-earth export restrictions for a year and resume purchases of US soybeans, a vital export for American farmers. Just ahead of the APEC Summit, Reuters reported that China had bought its first cargoes of US soybeans in several months, signalling tentative progress towards easing trade tensions.

The economy of the 20 nations sharing the euro expanded by 0.2% in the third quarter, beating expectations for a 0.1% increase in a Reuters poll, with France and Spain growing well above average, balancing out stagnation in Germany and Italy. On an annualised basis, the economy grew by 1.3%, ahead of expectations for 1.2%, a level economists consider to be around its natural rate of growth without stimulus. Spain remained the best performer among the bloc's largest economies, growing by 0.6% on the quarter, in line with forecasts, while France expanded by 0.5%, beating expectations for 0.2%. Germany and Italy meanwhile both stagnated. Thursday's figures ease pressure on the ECB to cut interest rates any further in the near term as they confirm the bank's long standing view that the economy is proving resilient to this year's unusual spike in uncertainty. While trade tensions, lingering uncertainty and Chinese dumping of surplus goods could still weigh on growth in the months ahead, economists remain relatively upbeat about the outlook and ECB projections suggest that last quarter may have been the worst for some time. Growth could pick up as past interest rate cuts work their way through the economy, households sit on ample saving, Germany boosts spending, uncertainty over tariffs eases and inventories have already run low. Indeed business activity, measured by a key purchasing managers survey, is already showing a pick up, sentiment in Germany, the bloc's biggest nation, is improving and business are becoming more optimistic, partly over lower tariff uncertainty. But any growth pick up is likely to be modest as the rigid structure of the euro zone economy limits activity, say economists, who predict growth in the 1.2% to 1.5% range for years to come.

    "title": "Marcos leaves for APEC meet in South Korea",
    "text": "(UPDATE) PRESIDENT Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday departed for South Korea to participate in the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ Meeting, where he will promote the Philippines and push for stronger regional trade and investment ties. Marcos left Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on board the presidential plane with first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos for the summit scheduled from Oct. 30 to Nov. 2 in Gyeongju, South Korea. In his departure statement, Marcos said the growth and stability of the Asia-Pacific region were directly tied to the opportunities and welfare of all Filipinos, as the region accounts for nearly 46 percent of global trade in goods and commercial services, and generates around 61 percent of global gross domestic product. “So, given these high stakes, this gathering is imperative. We convene at a critical juncture, defined by evolving geopolitical landscapes, supply chain disruptions, threats of climate change, and the urgent need for equitable and inclusive growth,” Marcos said. Citing the theme of this year’s APEC gathering, “Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect. Innovate. Prosper,” Marcos said the Philippines was committed to accelerate physical and digital connectivity, as well as digital transformation for competitiveness, and ensure stable and equitable prosperity for all Filipinos. “Our collaboration with the Republic of Korea and all APEC economies is pivotal. We will forge deeper ties around our shared goals and objectives, including fostering AI-driven innovation, enhancing cultural and creative industries, and proactively addressing demographic challenges,” the president said. “This collective resolve will ensure that our development efforts align with regional progress, laying the groundwork for a future where the power of creativity, technology and sustainability benefits every Filipino,” he added. Marcos said his engagements with the leaders of economies in the Asia-Pacific region would focus on “actionable areas” consistent with his administration’s long-term vision under AmBisyon 2040. He said these areas were guaranteeing equitable access to digital services and financial inclusion, particularly in underserved rural areas; advancing seamless movement of goods and people through investment facilitation and infrastructure development; promoting supply chain resiliency amid shocks and crises; and promoting digital literacy and skills development for micro, small and medium enterprises, women, and other segments who can realize their full economic potential through digitalization. The president said he was scheduled to address the APEC CEO Summit, an annual gathering of top CEOs in the region, where he would showcase the Philippines’ commitment to fostering economic partnerships and promoting a favorable business climate, aligned with the government’s vision of building a strong, innovation-driven economy. “Among others, we will highlight how we are pursuing digital transformation as a core pillar of our development, fully recognizing the potential of new technologies to unlock a more prosperous and resilient future,” said Marcos, who is heading to the APEC meetings after a four-day visit in Malaysia for the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Summit and Related Summits. Coming from the 47th Asean Summit, the president said he would lobby for stronger collaboration with regional partners, including Asean, to achieve the shared objectives for a sustainable, technologically empowered and inclusive future. “As the chair[man] of Asean in 2026, our goal is to impart that working silos impede the region’s potential. Real growth and lasting prosperity are achievable when we break down barriers, share knowledge, and collaborate across sectors, industries and communities,” he said. On the sidelines of the APEC meetings, President Marcos will meet with South Korean business leaders to deepen trade ties, attract investments and strengthen people-to-people cooperation. “I want to use this moment to reaffirm a core truth to the international business community: The Philippines is not merely ready. We are a reliable, forward-looking partner in the Asia-Pacific. Invest in the Filipino,” he said. Marcos also looked forward to meeting the Filipino community in Busan for the first time, where Filipinos thrive and make meaningful contributions to the city’s socioeconomic growth and further strengthen the enduring people-to-people ties between the Philippines and South Korea. Meanwhile, Marcos said that the ongoing meeting between United States President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would influence discussions at APEC, saying any agreement between the two economic powers would have global ripple effects. “The world is watching because this is the source of the largest shock that has entered into the world trade system. And we have to see what the agreements will be coming out of these meetings between President Xi and President Trump,” Marcos said. “Those will certainly color everything that we will be talking about in this APEC because the agreements or the arrangements that are made between two of the largest economies of the world will certainly affect every single citizen of the world,” he added. Trump kicked off a meeting with Xi at a South Korean air base on Thursday, optimistic about striking a trade-war truce between the world’s two largest economies. “We are going to have a very successful meeting, I have no doubt. But he is a very tough negotiator,” Trump said, as he shook hands with Xi. A few days ago, trade negotiators for both countries reached a “fundamental consensus on addressing each other’s primary concerns,” Xi said. “I am willing to continue working with President Trump to lay a solid foundation for China-US relations,” he added. During the president’s trip, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin will head the three-man government caretaker committee, with Agrarian Reform Secretary Conrado Estrella III and Education Secretary Sonny Angara as members. Part of Marcos’ delegation are Presidential Communications Acting Secretary Dave Gomez, Foreign Affairs Secretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro, Trade Secretary Cristina Roque, Migrant Workers Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac, Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick Go, and Palace Press Officer Claire Castro. Established in 1989, the regional economic forum aims to harness the growing interdependence of the Asia-Pacific region to promote greater prosperity for its people. Marcos’ attendance this year marks his return to the summit after skipping last year’s meeting in Peru to focus on the government’s disaster response efforts.",

    "title": "Giving stalling car industry a break on petrol-engine ban could be a mistake",
    "text": "A law banning petrol and diesel engines in new cars by 2035, supposed to be one of the main planks of Europe’s ambitious green agenda, has become the latest front in a Brussels tug of war between climate and industrial policy. The law is part of the European Union’s efforts to become climate neutral by the middle of the century, by phasing out polluting cars and encouraging people to switch to greener electric vehicles (EVs). You will still be able to buy second-hand petrol or diesel cars after 2035, but new vehicles coming off the manufacturing lines will have to be battery-powered. The combustion engine ban, which was approved by the European Parliament and national governments two years ago, is in the sights of the stalling car industry. Volkswagen, BMW and other big German carmakers, which Berlin has rowed in behind, are looking for leeway on the deadline and specific carveouts. The fight cuts across several big questions policymakers are wrestling with: climate targets, the level of regulation from Brussels, Europe’s sluggish economy and the threat of China eating the EU’s lunch. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, whose “green deal” reforms introduced the 2035 engine ban during her first term at the helm of the EU’s powerful executive body, is under pressure to walk it back. The commission president has promised a review of the ban by the end of this year, which is expected to outline proposed changes. German chancellor Friedrich Merz is on a mission to strip back EU regulations he views as a burden on European industry. The plan to stop any new carbon dioxide-emitting cars being produced in 10 years is at the top of his list. There, he has a friend in Manfred Weber, the conservative German MEP who leads the European People’s Party (EPP), the centre-right grouping that dominates the European Parliament. Merz, Weber and von der Leyen all belong to the same political family in German politics, a home constituency the commission president can’t be seen to ignore. Definitely not when Germany’s industrial engine – the auto sector – is feeling the financial pinch and laying off workers. The review of the combustion engine ban will have to be a tidy piece of politics. Von der Leyen needs to give something to the car industry, but still hang on to the broad ambition of her legislation. That something might be scope for the car industry to keep producing hybrids, with both electric and combustion engines, beyond 2035, or a delay in the cut-off. Promising more help to car manufacturers developing their EV battery supply in Europe could be another sweetener. Giorgia Meloni’s hard-right Italian government has lined up beside Germany in opposition to the 2035 ban. The French and Spanish governments have been fighting a rearguard action in defence of the EU pivot to electric vehicles. A paper authored by France and Spain, circulated to diplomats in Brussels last week, said Europe didn’t stand a chance of hitting its climate targets if it failed to gradually get people to shift away from petrol and diesel cars. The paper, seen by The Irish Times, called for the review to “preserve the 2035 cap” and the environmental ambition behind it. The two big countries said that did not mean the auto industry could not be allowed some “flexibilities” to smooth its transition to EV production, but any leeway needed to be contingent on companies manufacturing their cars in Europe, not abroad. Ban or no ban, Europe is up against the clock to produce affordable electric vehicles. China is making moves to take over as much of the market as it can. Beijing has pumped huge amounts of state resources into industries it thinks will dominate the coming decades, from renewable energy to artificial intelligence and electric and self-driving vehicles. Trade hawks in the European Commission are concerned that China is halfway around the track and Europe is still lacing up its runners. The danger is that Chinese-made EVs, manufactured by say BYD, can seriously undercut European competitors on price, over time snuffing out domestic EV production here and leaving Europe reliant on China for its cars. Last year, the EU slapped defensive tariffs on imports of EVs from China to compensate for what the commission deemed to be an unfair leg-up Beijing gives its industry, which was allowing Chinese manufacturers to flood the European market. Pushing out the 2035 cut-off point for petrol and diesel engines might give European car manufacturers a break in the short term, but it won’t help them catch up to their Chinese rivals in the electric vehicle race.",

    "title": "Labor Slashes Regional Funding Again",
    "text": "The Regional Development Victoria (RDV) annual report has revealed grants have been cut by $15 million, or 11 per cent, compared to the previous year. Four years ago, RDV had a total grants pool of $370 million to support development in the regions. Last year, it was just $118 million – a 70 per cent drop. But what is just as damning is the staffing wages bill at RDV. Employee expenses in the last financial year totalled $27.9 million – up 17 per cent from $23 million the previous year. To put it simply, regional Victorians are paying more for public servants, but getting less in return in development grants. Leader of The Nationals and Shadow Minister for Regional Development and Liveability, Danny O’Brien, said Labor is continuing to ignore regional Victorians. “The great divide continues. Labor is leaving regional Victorians out in the cold,” Mr O’Brien said. “It is impossible to justify a 70 per cent cut in grants for regional development across the past four years. “These grants are so important in supporting jobs, infrastructure and helping local economies flourish and thrive.” Mr O’Brien also questioned the staffing cost blow-out. “If RDV is delivering less grants and programs, why is it spending more in wages? Clearly, there’s less work to do,” Mr O’Brien said. “This is a double-edged sword. Regional Victorians are receiving less and paying more for the privilege because Labor can’t manage money.”",

    "title": "Trump, Xi talks wrap up with outcome unclear",
    "text": "China has agreed to keep rare earth exports flowing to the world as part of a one-year agreement, President Donald Trump said on Thursday shortly after meeting his counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea. The agreement, which Trump provided few details about except that it would probably be extended, would \"settle\" the issue, he said. China has yet to comment on what was agreed by the two leaders in talks, which ran for almost two hours. \"All of the rare earth has been settled,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \"And that's for the world, worldwide, you could say this was a worldwide situation, not just a U.S. situation.\" \"There is no roadblock at all on rare earth. That will hopefully disappear from our vocabulary for a little while.\" Rare earths, 17 elements which play tiny but vital roles in cars, planes and weapons, have emerged from obscurity to become China's most potent source of leverage in its trade war with the United States. Export controls introduced in April caused widespread shortages overseas, especially for magnets, forcing some automakers to pause production before exports rebounded following deals between Beijing and Washington and the European Union to free up the flow. China expanded those controls again in October, taking the total number of elements restricted to 12 and adding much of the equipment used to process them. The expanded controls are set to come into force in early November and it is unclear whether the agreement discussed by Trump covers the full suite of China's rare earth export controls or just the October extension. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, also on the flight, said China would not be imposing its proposed rare earth controls after an understanding between the presidents. He did not comment on controls that are already in place.",

    "title": "Instant View: Market analysts react to Trump-Xi meeting",
    "text": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump held talks with China's Xi Jinping at a South Korean air base on Thursday, with both leaders sounding optimistic about cooling trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. Market reaction was fairly muted as investors awaited further details of any agreement with Chinese stocks holding steady near a 10-year peak. Here are some comments from market analysts and investors: TARECK HORCHANI, HEAD OF DEALING, PRIME BROKERAGE, MAYBANK SECURITIES, SINGAPORE: \"The U.S.–China trade truce is likely to be greeted as a relief rally rather than a structural reset. When such truces occur, one of the first areas both sides highlight is agriculture, a politically sensitive sector in the U.S. where farmers form a key constituency. \"Overall, this looks like a tactical pause rather than a strategic breakthrough, with underlying tensions in technology, supply chains and rare earths still unresolved.\" DICKIE WONG, HEAD OF RESEARCH, KINGSTON SECURITIES, HONG KONG: \"I don't see there's any major optimistic surprise at this point, both for the markets and the U.S.-China talks. It's still that same question - after the meeting ends, does it really mean the two countries will have a joint statement, and then the U.S. will roll back all tariffs on China, drop tech curbs, and China will export rare earths again? I don't see any possibility. \"The markets have already priced in much of the positives and there could be an 'anti-climax' development.\" MUHAMMAD SAIFUDDIN BIN SAPUAN, ECONOMIST, KENANGA INVESTMENT BANK, KUALA LUMPUR: \"I think this is a tactical pause rather than a structural shift as both likely aim to ease tensions. But the truce will help stabilise global sentiment and trade expectations in the short term, which offers a relief for global demand and supply chain. \"Nevertheless, we still think that structural decoupling between the U.S. and China will continue to shape the long-term outlook.\" (Reporting by Yantoultra Ngui in Singapore, Jiaxing Li in Hong Kong; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

    "title": "5-year wait ends: Bengaluru’s delayed Hosakerehalli flyover finally set to open in November",
    "text": "The long-delayed Hosakerehalli flyover on Outer Ring Road (ORR), near PES College in southwest Bengaluru, is finally nearing completion and is expected to open to traffic by mid-November. The 500-metre structure was planned to ease congestion at one of the city’s busiest junctions but has faced repeated delays since its launch. The project began in August 2020 with an initial deadline of just 15 months. However, more than five years, around 64 months have passed since then. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) faced criticism for the prolonged delay, prompting the recently formed Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) to issue a 15-day ultimatum for completion, as per a report by Times of India (TOI).

During the interaction, residents highlighted a range of civic concerns, from pending infrastructure projects and flooding to traffic chaos and poor connectivity in the Koramangala–Ejipura corridor. The meeting centred on the stalled flyover project, which began before 2019, halted midway, and was recently revived under a new contractor.",

    "title": "Trump cuts China tariffs to 47pc after ‘amazing’ Xi meeting",
    "text": "BUSAN, Oct 30 — US President Donald Trump said today he had agreed to reduce tariffs on China to 47 per cent in exchange for Beijing resuming US soybean purchases, keeping rare earths exports flowing and cracking down on the illicit trade of fentanyl. His remarks after face-to-face talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the South Korean city of Busan, their first since 2019, marked the finale of Trump’s whirlwind Asia trip on which he also touted trade breakthroughs with South Korea, Japan and South-east Asian nations. “I thought it was an amazing meeting,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One shortly after he departed Busan, adding that tariffs imposed on Chinese imports would be cut to 47 per cent from 57 per cent. Trading in global stocks was choppy as Trump revealed details of the deal, with major Asian indexes and European futures swinging between gains and losses. China’s Shanghai Composite Index slipped from a 10-year high, while US soybean futures were weaker. World stock markets from Wall Street to Tokyo had hit record highs leading up to the meeting on hopes of a breakthrough in a trade war between the world’s two largest economies that has upended supply chains and rocked global business confidence. The meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, lasted nearly two hours. Trump shook hands and escorted Xi to his car before the US president was given a red-carpet send-off at the airport. Trump repeatedly talked up the prospect of reaching agreement with Xi since US negotiators on Sunday said they had agreed a framework with China that will avoid 100 per cent US tariffs on Chinese goods and achieve a deferral of China’s export curbs on rare earths, a sector it dominates. But with both countries increasingly willing to play hardball over areas of economic and geopolitical competition, many questions remain about how long any trade detente may last. — Reuters",

    "text": "Education October 30, 2025 by \nBola Olajuwon and Victoria Amadi The Minister of Education, Dr. Maruf Tunji Alausa, has embarked on a comprehensive overhaul of the country’s education system since he took over the ministry, moving from the traditional structure towards a skills-focused curriculum and a sustainable education model.\n\n\n\nA major part of the reforms is the restructuring of the national curriculum for basic, senior secondary and technical education, which commenced this academic year.\n\n\n\nThe ministry had also added new vocational and trade subjects to the curriculum, including digital literacy, solar installation, agricultural entrepreneurship, and garment making. This is intended to entrench practical skills from an early age and prepare students for the demands of the modern job market.       \nAccording to the minister, the total number of subjects a student would offer would be streamlined across different grade levels to reduce “content overload” and enable deeper learning.\n\n\n\nThe government has converted federal science and technical colleges into modern technical colleges. This includes free tuition and stipends for students, with a curriculum that is 80 per cent practical and 20 per cent theoretical.     \nAlausa has also emphasised the need for ongoing education reforms to move beyond policy declarations and deliver practical outcomes that strengthen skills, innovation, and job creation among young people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the ultimate goal of the reforms is to ensure that students are not only educated but also equipped with the competencies required to thrive in a fast-changing global economy.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the Federal Government was working to align education with the needs of the labour market through curriculum review, improved teacher training, and investment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSO: Why petrol prices are high despite cheaper crude\nThe minister, at the National Education Group (NEG) Meeting in Abuja, noted that the future of the country depended on how well its education system produced citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlausa said: “Our reforms must go beyond the paperwork of policy; they must impact classrooms, teachers, and ultimately the learners. Education should not end with certificates but open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity.”\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the ministry is prioritising partnerships with the private sector and development agencies to expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research, and digital learning.\n\n\n\n “If we are to build a competitive economy, we must invest in the skills and knowledge base of our young people so that they can become drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NEG Meeting brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including policymakers, education administrators, academics, and development partners, to deliberate on strategies for improving education delivery and learning outcomes across all levels.\n\n\n\nParticipants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector.\n\n\n\nDuring the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole.\n\n\n\nCONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities\nThe President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nSunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation.\n\n\n\nReiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective.\n\n\n\nHe advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers  960,000 youths to get technical vocational training  English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment   \nSunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes.\n\n\n\n“Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said.\n\n\n\nHe also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added.\n\n\n\nDrawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and  innovations birthed).\n\n\n\n“Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist\nAn education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it.\n\n\n\nOrji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nHe reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation.\n\n\n\n“I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy.\n\n\n\n“I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity.

He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment.\n\n\n\nOffurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more.\n\n\n\nOffurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate.\n\n\n\n“To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted.\n\n\n\nThese are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman\nAbia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money.

He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more.\n\n\n\nOffurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate.\n\n\n\n“To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted.\n\n\n\nThese are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman\nAbia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” According to him, the ministry is prioritising partnerships with the private sector and development agencies to expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research, and digital learning.\n\n\n\n “If we are to build a competitive economy, we must invest in the skills and knowledge base of our young people so that they can become drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NEG Meeting brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including policymakers, education administrators, academics, and development partners, to deliberate on strategies for improving education delivery and learning outcomes across all levels.\n\n\n\nParticipants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector.\n\n\n\nDuring the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole.\n\n\n\nCONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities\nThe President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nSunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation.\n\n\n\nReiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective.\n\n\n\nHe advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions.

He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it.\n\n\n\nOrji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nHe reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation.\n\n\n\n“I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms.

He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more.\n\n\n\nOffurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate.\n\n\n\n“To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process.

But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist\nAn education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it.\n\n\n\nOrji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nHe reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation.\n\n\n\n“I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms.

    "title": "The Grand Egyptian Museum showcasing 50,000 artifacts is finally opening",
    "text": "CAIRO: After two decades of anticipation and countless delays, the Grand Egyptian Museum is finally having its grand reveal.\n\tThe museum, which is set to officially open Saturday, highlights Egypt’s ancient civilization and is a centerpiece of the government’s drive to boost the tourist industry, a major source of foreign currency in the cash-strapped country.\n\tLocated just outside Cairo next to the famed Giza Pyramids, the $1 billion mammoth facility is poised to become the world’s largest museum dedicated to a single civilization with over 50,000 artifacts detailing the life in ancient Egypt. By comparison, the Louvre Museum in Paris has about 35,000 pieces on display.\n\tThe museum is one of the mega-projects championed by President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, who since taking office in 2014 embarked on massive investments in infrastructure with the aim of reviving an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered by the unrest that followed the 2011 Arab Spring uprising.\n\tThe museum’s construction began in 2005, but work stopped for three years during the political turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising.\n\tThe grand opening was postponed multiple times, most recently in July this year because of conflicts in the Middle East. World leaders are expected to attend the opening ceremony Saturday.\n\tGiant building with a view of the Giza Pyramids\n\tDesigned by the Irish firm Heneghan Peng Architects, the museum, known as GEM, boasts a towering, triangular glass façade imitating the nearby pyramids.\n\tIn its entrance atrium stands the granite colossus of one of Egypt’s most famed pharaohs, Ramesses the Great. The 3,200-year-old, 11-meters-tall (36-foot-tall) statue was moved to the museum after decades of standing in the center of a traffic-clogged roundabout in front of Cairo’s main train station.\n\tFrom the atrium, a grand six-story staircase lined with ancient statues leads up to the main galleries and a view of the nearby pyramids. A bridge links the museum to the pyramids, allowing tourists to move between them either on foot or via electric, environment-friendly vehicles, according to museum officials.\n\tThe museum includes 24,000 square meters (258,000 square feet) of permanent exhibition space, a children’s museum and conference and educational facilities, and a commercial area as well as a large conservation center.\n\tThe 12 main galleries, which opened last year, exhibit antiquities spanning from prehistoric times to the Roman era, organized by era and by themes.\n\tMany of the 50,000 artifacts in the GEM were moved from the Egyptian Museum, a packed, century-old building in downtown Cairo’s Tahrir Square. Others were recently unearthed from ancient cemeteries, including the Saqqara necropolis, another complex of pyramids and tombs about 14 miles (22 kilometers) south of the museum.\n\tThe halls are equipped with advanced technology and feature multimedia presentations including mixed-reality shows to help explain ancient Egypt to new generations, said Ahmed Ghoneim, the museum’s CEO.\n\t“We’re using the language that the Gen Z uses right now,” he said in an interview. “Gen Z doesn’t use anymore the labels that we read as old people but rather use technology.”\n\tTutankhamun collection in one place for the first time\n\tSaturday’s grand opening will include the inauguration of two halls dedicated to the 5,000 artifacts from the collection of King Tutankhamun.\n\tThe collection is being displayed in its entirety for the first time since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered King Tut’s tomb in 1922 in the southern city of Luxor. The old Egyptian Museum didn’t have enough space to show all the tomb’s treasures at once.\n\tSome masterpieces were restored at the museum’s conservation center, including the boy pharaoh’s three funeral beds and six chariots, said Jailan Mohamed, chief restorer at the conservation center.\n\tThey will be displayed along with his golden throne, his gold-covered sarcophagus and his burial mask, made of gold, quartzite, lapis lazuli and colored glass. The mask’s beard was accidentally knocked off and hastily glued back on with epoxy in 2014, before a German-Egyptian team of experts fixed it the following year.\n\tAnother centerpiece of the museum is the 4,600-year-old solar boat of King Khufu, the pharaoh who is credited with building the Great Pyramid of Giza. The 43-meter-long (140-foot) wooden boat, discovered in the 1950s, was buried next to the Great Pyramid for Khufu — or Cheops as he is also known — to use in the afterlife. In 2021, it was moved from its display site by the pyramids into the Grand Egyptian Museum on a remote-controlled vehicle imported from Belgium.\n\tThe government hopes that the museum will revitalize tourism\n\tThe government hopes the museum will draw more tourists who will stay for a while and provide the foreign currency Egypt needs to shore up its economy.\n\tThe tourism sector suffered from years of political turmoil and violence following the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. In recent years, the sector has started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the effects of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine are a major source of tourists visiting Egypt.\n\tA record number of 15.7 million visited the country in 2024, according to official figures, and the government aims to attract 30 million visitors by 2032.\n\tAuthorities overhauled the whole area around the museum and the pyramids. Roads were paved and a metro station is being constructed outside the museum gates to ease access to the sites. An airport, Sphinx International Airport, was also opened west of Cairo — 40 minutes from the museum.\n\tHassan Allam, CEO of Hassan Allam Holding, the firm administering the museum, said they’re expecting between 15,000 and 20,000 visitors a day at the museum.\n\t“The world has been waiting … Everyone’s excited,” he said.",

    "title": "Trump says tariffs on China are dropping from 57% to 47% after talks on fentanyl curbs with Xi Jinping",
    "text": "ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump described his face-to-face with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday as a roaring success, saying he would cut tariffs on China, while Beijing had agreed to allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans. The president told reporters aboard Air Force One that the U.S. would lower tariffs implemented earlier this year as punishment on China for its selling of chemicals used to make fentanyl from 20% to 10%. That brings the total combined tariff rate on China down from 57% to 47% “I guess on the scale from 0 to 10, with ten being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,” Trump said. “I think it was a 12.” Trump said that he would go to China in April and Xi would come to the U.S. “some time after that.” The president said they also discussed the export of more advanced computer chips to China, saying that Nvidia would be in talks with Chinese officials. Trump said he could sign a trade deal with China “pretty soon.” Xi said Washington and Beijing would work to finalize their agreements to provide “peace of mind” to both countries and the rest of the world, according to a report on the meeting distributed by state media. “Both sides should take the long-term perspective into account, focusing on the benefits of cooperation rather than falling into a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation,” he said. Despite Trump’s optimism after a 100-minute meeting with Xi in South Korea, there continues to be the potential for major tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Both nations are seeking dominant places in manufacturing, developing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and shaping world affairs like Russia’s war in Ukraine. Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs since returning to the White House for a second term, combined with China’s retaliatory limits on exports of rare earth elements, gave the meeting newfound urgency. There is a mutual recognition that neither side wants to risk blowing up the world economy in ways that could jeopardize their own country’s fortunes. When the two were seated at the start of the meeting, Xi read prepared remarks that stressed a willingness to work together despite differences. “Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other,” he said through a translator. “It is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then.” There was a slight difference in translation as China’s Xinhua News Agency reported Xi as telling Trump that having some differences is inevitable. The leaders met in Busan, South Korea, a port city about 76 kilometers (47 miles) south from Gyeongju, the main venue for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. In the days leading up to the meeting, U.S. officials signaled that Trump did not intend to make good on a recent threat to impose an additional 100% import tax on Chinese goods, and China showed signs it was willing to relax its export controls on rare earths and also buy soybeans from America. Officials from both countries met earlier this week in Kuala Lumpur to lay the groundwork for their leaders. Afterward, China’s top trade negotiator Li Chenggang said they had reached a “preliminary consensus,” a statement affirmed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who said there was “ a very successful framework.” Shortly before the meeting on Thursday, Trump posted on Truth Social that the meeting would be the “G2,” a recognition of America and China’s status as the world’s biggest economies. The Group of Seven and Group of 20 are other forums of industrialized nations. But while those summits often happen at luxury spaces, this meeting took place in humbler surroundings: Trump and Xi met in a small gray building with a blue roof on a military base adjacent to Busan’s international airport. The anticipated detente has given investors and businesses caught between the two nations a sense of relief. The U.S. stock market has climbed on the hopes of a trade framework coming out of the meeting. Pressure points remain for both US and China\nTrump has outward confidence that the grounds for a deal are in place, but previous negotiations with China this year in Geneva, Switzerland and London had a start-stop quality to them. The initial promise of progress has repeatedly given way to both countries seeking a better position against the other. “The proposed deal on the table fits the pattern we’ve seen all year: short-term stabilization dressed up as strategic progress,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “Both sides are managing volatility, calibrating just enough cooperation to avert crisis while the deeper rivalry endures.” The U.S. and China have each shown they believe they have levers to pressure the other, and the past year has demonstrated that tentative steps forward can be short-lived. For Trump, that pressure comes from tariffs. China had faced new tariffs this year totaling 30%, of which 20% were tied to its role in fentanyl production. But the tariff rates have been volatile. In April, he announced plans to jack the rate on Chinese goods to 145%, only to abandon those plans as markets recoiled. Then, on Oct. 10, Trump threatened a 100% import tax because of China’s rare earth restrictions. That figure, including past tariffs, would now be 47% “effective immediately,” Trump told reporters on Thursday. Xi has his own chokehold on the world economy because China is the top producer and processor of the rare earth minerals needed to make fighter jets, robots, electric vehicles and other high-tech products. China had tightened export restrictions on Oct. 9, repeating a cycle in which each nation jockeys for an edge only to back down after more trade talks. What might also matter is what happens directly after their talks. Trump plans to return to Washington, while Xi plans to stay on in South Korea to meet with regional leaders during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which officially begins on Friday. “Xi sees an opportunity to position China as a reliable partner and bolster bilateral and multilateral relations with countries frustrated by the U.S. administration’s tariff policy,” said Jay Truesdale, a former State Department official who is CEO of TD International, a risk and intelligence advisory firm. ___ Ken Moritsugu in Beijing and Seung Min Kim and Michelle Price in Washington contributed to this report.
