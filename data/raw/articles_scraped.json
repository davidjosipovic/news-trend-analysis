Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More If you've been hoping for another RBA interest rate cut this year, the economists at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) have some bad news for you. CBA revised its outlook for rate relief Down Under following yesterday's widely unexpected surge in inflation. News which sent the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) into a tailspin in early afternoon trade on Wednesday. The prospect of ASX 200 investors or Aussie mortgage holders seeing another 2025 interest rate cut from the RBA all but vanished yesterday after the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicator rose 1.3% in the September quarter and 3.2% annually. That marks the highest quarterly inflation increase since March 2023 and was well ahead of market expectations. The annual inflation print was the highest level since the June 2024 quarter. As for trimmed mean annual inflation, which removes certain volatile items and is the metric favoured by the RBA, it came in at 3% for the September quarter, up from 2.7% in the June quarter. This was the first time trimmed mean annual inflation rose since December 2022, and it came in well above the RBA's forecast of 2.6%. Which brings us to… Commenting on the surprise surge in inflation, Belinda Allen, head of Australian economics at CBA, said, \"This result will be a genuine concern for the RBA. We expect the central bank to take a more hawkish tone to avoid a return to higher inflation.\" The RBA meets next week and announces its interest rate decision on Tuesday. As for that upcoming meeting, CBA said, \"We expect the cash rate to be held steady at 3.60%.\" Unfortunately for ASX investors patiently waiting until 2026 for the next rate cuts, CBA also believes those are off the table for now. According to the ASX 200 bank: Given the material upside surprise to the Q3 25 CPI, and the broad-based nature of pricing pressures, we now expect the RBA to remain on hold from here. Previously we expected one last rate cut in February 2026 to bring the cash rate back closer to neutral. So, what will it take for Aussie to get some rate relief? \"We expect it would take a material move higher in the unemployment rate, together with more moderate inflation prints, to bring the RBA back to the cutting table,\" CBA said. Could, gasp, the next RBA interest rate move actually be higher? According to CBA, that's certainly a possibility, with the bank noting \"the latest data has tilted the risks to the upside\". CBA concluded, \"If inflation remains elevated in 2026, as we expect it could, the RBA may need to act.\"",

    "title": "Business : Xi Jinping Urges Partnership With Us, Says Frictions Are 'normal' Between Economic Powers",
    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 30 (Bernama) -- China and the United States (US) should be partners and friends, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his meeting with his counterpart Donald Trump at the Gimhae Air Base in Busan, South Korea, while stating that it is normal for two economic powerhouses to have frictions at times. Trump called Xi a great leader, “President Xi is a great leader of a great country, and I think we are going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it is an honour to have you with us. Thank you very much.” Xi said, “China’s relations have remained stable on the whole (and) given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then and in the face of winds, waves and challenges.” “You and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course and ensure the steady sailing forward of the giant ship of China-US relations. I always believe that China’s development goes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again,” he said in the video that was streamed live by The White House. Xi said both leaders have spoken over the phone three times, exchanged several letters, and stayed in close contact since Trump’s re-election. He said both Beijing and Washington are fully able to help each other succeed and prosper together. “Over the years, I have stated in public many times that China and the US should be partners and friends. This is what history has taught us and what reality demands,” Xi said. Xi said that in the latest round of consultation, both economic and trade teams have reached a basic consensus on addressing respective major concerns and made encouraging progress. Earlier in his opening remarks, Trump also mentioned the consensus that has been reached. “I think we have already agreed to a lot of things, and we will agree to some more right now,” said Trump. Xi said the consensus provided the necessary conditions for their meeting today. He said, “Mr President, I am ready to continue working with you to build a solid foundation for China-US relations and create a sound atmosphere for the development of both countries.” Meanwhile, Trump also said Xi is a “very tough negotiator”, and a China-US trade deal could be signed between the two countries. Xi also expressed his appreciation for Trump’s contribution to the recent conclusion of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. “Mr President, you care a lot about world peace, and you are very enthusiastic about settling various regional hotspot issues. I appreciate your great contribution to the recent conclusion of the Gaza ceasefire agreement,” he said. The Chinese President also mentioned the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord, signed in Kuala Lumpur by Cambodia and Thailand. He said China has been helping, in its own way, for both countries to settle their border disputes, and that it has also been promoting peace talks to resolve other hotspot issues. “The world today is confronted with many tough problems. China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world,” he said. Both leaders are in South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Week, which is taking place in Gyeongju, a coastal city. Malaysia is a founding member of APEC, an intergovernmental forum comprising 21 economies. Collectively, the APEC economies contribute approximately 61 per cent of global gross domestic product and 46 per cent of world trade, underscoring their pivotal role in driving international economic growth and integration. With a population exceeding three billion, the APEC region continues to serve as a key engine of global development and is projected to expand by 2.9 per cent in 2026, reflecting its resilience and enduring economic potential. -- BERNAMA BERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\n\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial © 2025 BERNAMA  \n      • Disclaimer  \n      • Privacy Policy  \n      • Security Policy",

    "text": "African glass bead art has been a part of cultural expression for centuries, combining traditional techniques with modern aesthetics.\nThis art form has evolved, yet retained its roots, showcasing the rich heritage and creativity of African artisans.\nFrom intricate patterns to vibrant colors, glass bead art continues to captivate audiences worldwide.\nHere are five fascinating aspects of this unique artistic tradition. #1 Glass beads have been a part of African culture since ancient times. They were used for trade, adornment, and spiritual purposes.\n    The introduction of European-made glass beads in the 15th century revolutionized the industry, making them more accessible.\n    Today, these beads are still used in traditional ceremonies and contemporary fashion alike. #2 The art of bead-making is passed down generations, with artisans perfecting their craft over the years.\n    Traditional techniques include melting raw materials and shaping them into small spheres or tubes.\n    Modern innovations have introduced new colors and shapes, but the basic methods remain largely unchanged. #3 Each design in African glass bead art carries cultural significance.\n    Patterns may depict social status, tribal affiliation, or personal identity.\n    Colors also have meanings; for example, red may symbolize strength, while blue could represent peace.\n    Understanding these symbols adds depth to appreciating this art form. #4 The production and sale of glass beads provide a source of income for many communities across Africa.\n    Artisans often work in cooperatives that support fair trade practices and sustainable development initiatives.\n    The global demand for authentic African beadwork helps preserve this tradition while contributing to local economies. #5 In recent years, there has been a resurgence in popularity for African glass bead jewelry among fashion enthusiasts around the world.\n    Designers are incorporating these vibrant pieces into modern wardrobes, highlighting their versatility as both statement accessories and subtle embellishments.\n    This trend not only celebrates cultural heritage but also encourages ethical consumerism through supporting artisan communities.",

    "title": "Fed Meeting: Second Rate Cut Of The Year Announced, Benchmark Rates Lowered By 0.25%",
    "text": "The U.S. Federal Reserve just cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percent, which lines up with what most people on Wall Street expected. It's the second time they've trimmed rates this year, dropping the policy range to 3.75 to 4 percent. The vote wasn't unanimous either—out of twelve members, ten wanted this cut, one didn’t want any change, and another actually wanted an even bigger cut of 0.5 percent. The Fed didn’t give much of a hint about what they're planning for December. Back in September, they said there could be three more cuts in 2025, but for now, everyone’s waiting for the next meeting in December. After the announcement, markets bounced around—stocks jumped at first, then got shaky after the Fed Chair made his comments. So, what does the Fed say about the economy? In their official statement, they said things are still growing, but not too fast. Job growth is slowing down, and unemployment has ticked up a bit, though it’s still low. Inflation is higher than it was at the start of the year and isn’t coming down yet. The Fed keeps pointing to its two big goals: keeping unemployment low and hitting that 2 percent inflation target. Lately, with job risks creeping up, they decided a 0.25 percent rate cut was the right move to balance things out. They’re keeping a close eye on economic trends and global issues before making any more decisions. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke, markets got even more jittery. He said there’s a lot of disagreement inside the Fed about what to do in December, and it’s just too soon to say if there will be another cut this year. Stocks, which had gone up right after the rate cut, quickly lost those gains as investors digested his remarks. One more wrinkle: a government shutdown has held up a bunch of important economic reports. Even with some data missing, the Fed said they had enough information from both public and private sources to make the call. The shutdown has made it harder for agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect data. The White House warned that if this drags on, key inflation reports could be delayed, which could mess with how everyone judges the economy.",

    "title": "Asian Stocks Erase Gains After Trump-Xi Talks, Yen Falls: Markets Wrap",
    "text": "US equity-index futures erased gains and Asian shares lost momentum after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping ended their summit that was aimed at easing the trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Contracts for the S&P 500 were flat after the underlying gauge erased gains following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s warning that a rate cut in December isn’t a foregone conclusion. Asian shares gave up earlier gains to trade 0.1% lower. The technology sector remained in focus after Samsung Electronics Co.’s earnings beat estimates, and megacap US companies boosted bets on the artificial intelligence theme. The yen fluctuated against the dollar after the Bank of Japan held its policy rate. Gold was flat after four days of declines, while a gauge of the dollar trimmed gains from the prior session. Treasuries recouped some of their losses with the yield on the 10-year declining one basis point to 4.06%. Markets are looking past the Fed’s cautious stance on further rate cuts and turning their focus to the ongoing Trump–Xi meeting, which investors hope will ease the world’s largest trade dispute and steady global markets after months of tension. The artificial intelligence theme and spending by megacap companies were also in focus as big technology names started reporting earnings. Trump earlier said the US and China “could” sign a trade deal Thursday as the two leaders started a high-stakes meeting. The two leaders were set to finalise a détente at their South Korea meeting to put the world’s biggest trade fight on hold — at least for now. Earlier, following the Fed’s expected rate cut, Powell’s caution about future moves and his focus on labor market risks led investors to scale back easing bets. Fed officials delivered their second straight rate reduction Wednesday to support a softening labor market, and said they would stop shrinking the portfolio of assets on Dec. 1. Governor Stephen Miran dissented again in favor of a larger reduction. Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid said he preferred not to cut rates at all. Investors also got a chance to price in tech companies spending on artificial intelligence after earnings from megacaps. Three bellwethers – Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — together racked up some $78 billion in capital expenditures last quarter. That’s up 89% from a year earlier. Their earnings were mixed. Meta Platforms shares fell 7.4% in extended trading while Alphabet jumped 6.7%. Microsoft fell almost 4%. Earlier in the US trading day, Nvidia Corp. became the first company to reach $5 trillion in market valuation. “Even though the Fed communication was more hawkish than the market had expected, the news of Nvidia’s market cap exceeding $5 trillion and Alphabet’s favorable earnings announcement are supporting tech-related stocks in Asia,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. Some of the main moves in markets: S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% as of 1:16 p.m. Tokyo time Japan’s Topix rose 0.3% Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.5% Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.5% The Shanghai Composite was little changed Euro Stoxx 50 futures rose 0.2% The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1% The euro rose 0.2% to $1.1625 The Japanese yen was little changed at 152.74 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.0957 per dollar Bitcoin fell 1.4% to $109,904.42 Ether fell 1.8% to $3,881.47 The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 4.06% Japan’s 10-year yield was unchanged at 1.655% Australia’s 10-year yield advanced seven basis points to 4.29% West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.4% to $60.22 a barrel Spot gold rose 0.3% to $3,942.76 an ounce",

Earlier, the Department of Foreign Affairs said four outcome documents are expected to be secured during the Summit. Apart from the APEC activities, Marcos will also meet with members of the Filipino community in Busan. He will also have meetings with various business leaders and executives, which are expected to boost manufacturing and semiconductor investments.

    "title": "‘Friction Is Natural, But Ties Must Stay On Track’: Xi Jinping Urges Trump For China-US Partnership",
    "text": "Chinese President Xi Jinping met his American counterpart Donald Trump in South Korea on Thursday, marking their first meeting in six years. During the talks, Xi emphasised that Beijing and Washington must remain partners and friends, acknowledging that differences were “natural” but urging both nations to stay on the “right course.” “It is natural to have friction,” Xi said, adding, “China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish more great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world.” He also expressed appreciation for Trump’s efforts to promote peace in ongoing global conflicts, reiterating China’s willingness to continue working with the United States. In response, President Trump described Xi as “a great leader of a great country,” adding, “I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it's an honour to have you with us.” The two leaders met at an air base in the southern port city of Busan, with the encounter taking place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. This was also the first meeting since Trump’s return to office in January this year. As the two leaders shook hands, Trump remarked, “We are going to have a very successful meeting, I have no doubt. But he is a very tough negotiator.” The meeting came against the backdrop of renewed US-China trade tensions, which have persisted since 2018. The dispute reignited earlier this month after China proposed expanding curbs on exports of rare-earth minerals, a key component for high-tech manufacturing where Beijing holds global dominance. In response, Trump announced plans to impose additional 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods and hinted at further restrictions on exports involving US software - a move that analysts warned could severely disrupt the global economy. Following urgent negotiations between senior officials, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Beijing might delay the rare-earth export restrictions for a year and resume purchases of US soybeans, a vital export for American farmers. Just ahead of the APEC Summit, Reuters reported that China had bought its first cargoes of US soybeans in several months, signalling tentative progress towards easing trade tensions.

The economy of the 20 nations sharing the euro expanded by 0.2% in the third quarter, beating expectations for a 0.1% increase in a Reuters poll, with France and Spain growing well above average, balancing out stagnation in Germany and Italy. On an annualised basis, the economy grew by 1.3%, ahead of expectations for 1.2%, a level economists consider to be around its natural rate of growth without stimulus. Spain remained the best performer among the bloc's largest economies, growing by 0.6% on the quarter, in line with forecasts, while France expanded by 0.5%, beating expectations for 0.2%. Germany and Italy meanwhile both stagnated. Thursday's figures ease pressure on the ECB to cut interest rates any further in the near term as they confirm the bank's long standing view that the economy is proving resilient to this year's unusual spike in uncertainty. While trade tensions, lingering uncertainty and Chinese dumping of surplus goods could still weigh on growth in the months ahead, economists remain relatively upbeat about the outlook and ECB projections suggest that last quarter may have been the worst for some time. Growth could pick up as past interest rate cuts work their way through the economy, households sit on ample saving, Germany boosts spending, uncertainty over tariffs eases and inventories have already run low. Indeed business activity, measured by a key purchasing managers survey, is already showing a pick up, sentiment in Germany, the bloc's biggest nation, is improving and business are becoming more optimistic, partly over lower tariff uncertainty. But any growth pick up is likely to be modest as the rigid structure of the euro zone economy limits activity, say economists, who predict growth in the 1.2% to 1.5% range for years to come.

    "title": "Marcos leaves for APEC meet in South Korea",
    "text": "(UPDATE) PRESIDENT Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday departed for South Korea to participate in the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ Meeting, where he will promote the Philippines and push for stronger regional trade and investment ties. Marcos left Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on board the presidential plane with first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos for the summit scheduled from Oct. 30 to Nov. 2 in Gyeongju, South Korea. In his departure statement, Marcos said the growth and stability of the Asia-Pacific region were directly tied to the opportunities and welfare of all Filipinos, as the region accounts for nearly 46 percent of global trade in goods and commercial services, and generates around 61 percent of global gross domestic product. “So, given these high stakes, this gathering is imperative. We convene at a critical juncture, defined by evolving geopolitical landscapes, supply chain disruptions, threats of climate change, and the urgent need for equitable and inclusive growth,” Marcos said. Citing the theme of this year’s APEC gathering, “Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect. Innovate. Prosper,” Marcos said the Philippines was committed to accelerate physical and digital connectivity, as well as digital transformation for competitiveness, and ensure stable and equitable prosperity for all Filipinos. “Our collaboration with the Republic of Korea and all APEC economies is pivotal. We will forge deeper ties around our shared goals and objectives, including fostering AI-driven innovation, enhancing cultural and creative industries, and proactively addressing demographic challenges,” the president said. “This collective resolve will ensure that our development efforts align with regional progress, laying the groundwork for a future where the power of creativity, technology and sustainability benefits every Filipino,” he added. Marcos said his engagements with the leaders of economies in the Asia-Pacific region would focus on “actionable areas” consistent with his administration’s long-term vision under AmBisyon 2040. He said these areas were guaranteeing equitable access to digital services and financial inclusion, particularly in underserved rural areas; advancing seamless movement of goods and people through investment facilitation and infrastructure development; promoting supply chain resiliency amid shocks and crises; and promoting digital literacy and skills development for micro, small and medium enterprises, women, and other segments who can realize their full economic potential through digitalization. The president said he was scheduled to address the APEC CEO Summit, an annual gathering of top CEOs in the region, where he would showcase the Philippines’ commitment to fostering economic partnerships and promoting a favorable business climate, aligned with the government’s vision of building a strong, innovation-driven economy. “Among others, we will highlight how we are pursuing digital transformation as a core pillar of our development, fully recognizing the potential of new technologies to unlock a more prosperous and resilient future,” said Marcos, who is heading to the APEC meetings after a four-day visit in Malaysia for the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Summit and Related Summits. Coming from the 47th Asean Summit, the president said he would lobby for stronger collaboration with regional partners, including Asean, to achieve the shared objectives for a sustainable, technologically empowered and inclusive future. “As the chair[man] of Asean in 2026, our goal is to impart that working silos impede the region’s potential. Real growth and lasting prosperity are achievable when we break down barriers, share knowledge, and collaborate across sectors, industries and communities,” he said. On the sidelines of the APEC meetings, President Marcos will meet with South Korean business leaders to deepen trade ties, attract investments and strengthen people-to-people cooperation. “I want to use this moment to reaffirm a core truth to the international business community: The Philippines is not merely ready. We are a reliable, forward-looking partner in the Asia-Pacific. Invest in the Filipino,” he said. Marcos also looked forward to meeting the Filipino community in Busan for the first time, where Filipinos thrive and make meaningful contributions to the city’s socioeconomic growth and further strengthen the enduring people-to-people ties between the Philippines and South Korea. Meanwhile, Marcos said that the ongoing meeting between United States President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would influence discussions at APEC, saying any agreement between the two economic powers would have global ripple effects. “The world is watching because this is the source of the largest shock that has entered into the world trade system. And we have to see what the agreements will be coming out of these meetings between President Xi and President Trump,” Marcos said. “Those will certainly color everything that we will be talking about in this APEC because the agreements or the arrangements that are made between two of the largest economies of the world will certainly affect every single citizen of the world,” he added. Trump kicked off a meeting with Xi at a South Korean air base on Thursday, optimistic about striking a trade-war truce between the world’s two largest economies. “We are going to have a very successful meeting, I have no doubt. But he is a very tough negotiator,” Trump said, as he shook hands with Xi. A few days ago, trade negotiators for both countries reached a “fundamental consensus on addressing each other’s primary concerns,” Xi said. “I am willing to continue working with President Trump to lay a solid foundation for China-US relations,” he added. During the president’s trip, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin will head the three-man government caretaker committee, with Agrarian Reform Secretary Conrado Estrella III and Education Secretary Sonny Angara as members. Part of Marcos’ delegation are Presidential Communications Acting Secretary Dave Gomez, Foreign Affairs Secretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro, Trade Secretary Cristina Roque, Migrant Workers Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac, Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick Go, and Palace Press Officer Claire Castro. Established in 1989, the regional economic forum aims to harness the growing interdependence of the Asia-Pacific region to promote greater prosperity for its people. Marcos’ attendance this year marks his return to the summit after skipping last year’s meeting in Peru to focus on the government’s disaster response efforts.",

    "title": "Giving stalling car industry a break on petrol-engine ban could be a mistake",
    "text": "A law banning petrol and diesel engines in new cars by 2035, supposed to be one of the main planks of Europe’s ambitious green agenda, has become the latest front in a Brussels tug of war between climate and industrial policy. The law is part of the European Union’s efforts to become climate neutral by the middle of the century, by phasing out polluting cars and encouraging people to switch to greener electric vehicles (EVs). You will still be able to buy second-hand petrol or diesel cars after 2035, but new vehicles coming off the manufacturing lines will have to be battery-powered. The combustion engine ban, which was approved by the European Parliament and national governments two years ago, is in the sights of the stalling car industry. Volkswagen, BMW and other big German carmakers, which Berlin has rowed in behind, are looking for leeway on the deadline and specific carveouts. The fight cuts across several big questions policymakers are wrestling with: climate targets, the level of regulation from Brussels, Europe’s sluggish economy and the threat of China eating the EU’s lunch. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, whose “green deal” reforms introduced the 2035 engine ban during her first term at the helm of the EU’s powerful executive body, is under pressure to walk it back. The commission president has promised a review of the ban by the end of this year, which is expected to outline proposed changes. German chancellor Friedrich Merz is on a mission to strip back EU regulations he views as a burden on European industry. The plan to stop any new carbon dioxide-emitting cars being produced in 10 years is at the top of his list. There, he has a friend in Manfred Weber, the conservative German MEP who leads the European People’s Party (EPP), the centre-right grouping that dominates the European Parliament. Merz, Weber and von der Leyen all belong to the same political family in German politics, a home constituency the commission president can’t be seen to ignore. Definitely not when Germany’s industrial engine – the auto sector – is feeling the financial pinch and laying off workers. The review of the combustion engine ban will have to be a tidy piece of politics. Von der Leyen needs to give something to the car industry, but still hang on to the broad ambition of her legislation. That something might be scope for the car industry to keep producing hybrids, with both electric and combustion engines, beyond 2035, or a delay in the cut-off. Promising more help to car manufacturers developing their EV battery supply in Europe could be another sweetener. Giorgia Meloni’s hard-right Italian government has lined up beside Germany in opposition to the 2035 ban. The French and Spanish governments have been fighting a rearguard action in defence of the EU pivot to electric vehicles. A paper authored by France and Spain, circulated to diplomats in Brussels last week, said Europe didn’t stand a chance of hitting its climate targets if it failed to gradually get people to shift away from petrol and diesel cars. The paper, seen by The Irish Times, called for the review to “preserve the 2035 cap” and the environmental ambition behind it. The two big countries said that did not mean the auto industry could not be allowed some “flexibilities” to smooth its transition to EV production, but any leeway needed to be contingent on companies manufacturing their cars in Europe, not abroad. Ban or no ban, Europe is up against the clock to produce affordable electric vehicles. China is making moves to take over as much of the market as it can. Beijing has pumped huge amounts of state resources into industries it thinks will dominate the coming decades, from renewable energy to artificial intelligence and electric and self-driving vehicles. Trade hawks in the European Commission are concerned that China is halfway around the track and Europe is still lacing up its runners. The danger is that Chinese-made EVs, manufactured by say BYD, can seriously undercut European competitors on price, over time snuffing out domestic EV production here and leaving Europe reliant on China for its cars. Last year, the EU slapped defensive tariffs on imports of EVs from China to compensate for what the commission deemed to be an unfair leg-up Beijing gives its industry, which was allowing Chinese manufacturers to flood the European market. Pushing out the 2035 cut-off point for petrol and diesel engines might give European car manufacturers a break in the short term, but it won’t help them catch up to their Chinese rivals in the electric vehicle race.",

    "title": "Labor Slashes Regional Funding Again",
    "text": "The Regional Development Victoria (RDV) annual report has revealed grants have been cut by $15 million, or 11 per cent, compared to the previous year. Four years ago, RDV had a total grants pool of $370 million to support development in the regions. Last year, it was just $118 million – a 70 per cent drop. But what is just as damning is the staffing wages bill at RDV. Employee expenses in the last financial year totalled $27.9 million – up 17 per cent from $23 million the previous year. To put it simply, regional Victorians are paying more for public servants, but getting less in return in development grants. Leader of The Nationals and Shadow Minister for Regional Development and Liveability, Danny O’Brien, said Labor is continuing to ignore regional Victorians. “The great divide continues. Labor is leaving regional Victorians out in the cold,” Mr O’Brien said. “It is impossible to justify a 70 per cent cut in grants for regional development across the past four years. “These grants are so important in supporting jobs, infrastructure and helping local economies flourish and thrive.” Mr O’Brien also questioned the staffing cost blow-out. “If RDV is delivering less grants and programs, why is it spending more in wages? Clearly, there’s less work to do,” Mr O’Brien said. “This is a double-edged sword. Regional Victorians are receiving less and paying more for the privilege because Labor can’t manage money.”",

    "title": "Trump, Xi talks wrap up with outcome unclear",
    "text": "China has agreed to keep rare earth exports flowing to the world as part of a one-year agreement, President Donald Trump said on Thursday shortly after meeting his counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea. The agreement, which Trump provided few details about except that it would probably be extended, would \"settle\" the issue, he said. China has yet to comment on what was agreed by the two leaders in talks, which ran for almost two hours. \"All of the rare earth has been settled,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \"And that's for the world, worldwide, you could say this was a worldwide situation, not just a U.S. situation.\" \"There is no roadblock at all on rare earth. That will hopefully disappear from our vocabulary for a little while.\" Rare earths, 17 elements which play tiny but vital roles in cars, planes and weapons, have emerged from obscurity to become China's most potent source of leverage in its trade war with the United States. Export controls introduced in April caused widespread shortages overseas, especially for magnets, forcing some automakers to pause production before exports rebounded following deals between Beijing and Washington and the European Union to free up the flow. China expanded those controls again in October, taking the total number of elements restricted to 12 and adding much of the equipment used to process them. The expanded controls are set to come into force in early November and it is unclear whether the agreement discussed by Trump covers the full suite of China's rare earth export controls or just the October extension. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, also on the flight, said China would not be imposing its proposed rare earth controls after an understanding between the presidents. He did not comment on controls that are already in place.",

    "title": "Instant View: Market analysts react to Trump-Xi meeting",
    "text": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump held talks with China's Xi Jinping at a South Korean air base on Thursday, with both leaders sounding optimistic about cooling trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. Market reaction was fairly muted as investors awaited further details of any agreement with Chinese stocks holding steady near a 10-year peak. Here are some comments from market analysts and investors: TARECK HORCHANI, HEAD OF DEALING, PRIME BROKERAGE, MAYBANK SECURITIES, SINGAPORE: \"The U.S.–China trade truce is likely to be greeted as a relief rally rather than a structural reset. When such truces occur, one of the first areas both sides highlight is agriculture, a politically sensitive sector in the U.S. where farmers form a key constituency. \"Overall, this looks like a tactical pause rather than a strategic breakthrough, with underlying tensions in technology, supply chains and rare earths still unresolved.\" DICKIE WONG, HEAD OF RESEARCH, KINGSTON SECURITIES, HONG KONG: \"I don't see there's any major optimistic surprise at this point, both for the markets and the U.S.-China talks. It's still that same question - after the meeting ends, does it really mean the two countries will have a joint statement, and then the U.S. will roll back all tariffs on China, drop tech curbs, and China will export rare earths again? I don't see any possibility. \"The markets have already priced in much of the positives and there could be an 'anti-climax' development.\" MUHAMMAD SAIFUDDIN BIN SAPUAN, ECONOMIST, KENANGA INVESTMENT BANK, KUALA LUMPUR: \"I think this is a tactical pause rather than a structural shift as both likely aim to ease tensions. But the truce will help stabilise global sentiment and trade expectations in the short term, which offers a relief for global demand and supply chain. \"Nevertheless, we still think that structural decoupling between the U.S. and China will continue to shape the long-term outlook.\" (Reporting by Yantoultra Ngui in Singapore, Jiaxing Li in Hong Kong; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

    "title": "5-year wait ends: Bengaluru’s delayed Hosakerehalli flyover finally set to open in November",
    "text": "The long-delayed Hosakerehalli flyover on Outer Ring Road (ORR), near PES College in southwest Bengaluru, is finally nearing completion and is expected to open to traffic by mid-November. The 500-metre structure was planned to ease congestion at one of the city’s busiest junctions but has faced repeated delays since its launch. The project began in August 2020 with an initial deadline of just 15 months. However, more than five years, around 64 months have passed since then. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) faced criticism for the prolonged delay, prompting the recently formed Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) to issue a 15-day ultimatum for completion, as per a report by Times of India (TOI).

During the interaction, residents highlighted a range of civic concerns, from pending infrastructure projects and flooding to traffic chaos and poor connectivity in the Koramangala–Ejipura corridor. The meeting centred on the stalled flyover project, which began before 2019, halted midway, and was recently revived under a new contractor.",

    "title": "Trump cuts China tariffs to 47pc after ‘amazing’ Xi meeting",
    "text": "BUSAN, Oct 30 — US President Donald Trump said today he had agreed to reduce tariffs on China to 47 per cent in exchange for Beijing resuming US soybean purchases, keeping rare earths exports flowing and cracking down on the illicit trade of fentanyl. His remarks after face-to-face talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the South Korean city of Busan, their first since 2019, marked the finale of Trump’s whirlwind Asia trip on which he also touted trade breakthroughs with South Korea, Japan and South-east Asian nations. “I thought it was an amazing meeting,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One shortly after he departed Busan, adding that tariffs imposed on Chinese imports would be cut to 47 per cent from 57 per cent. Trading in global stocks was choppy as Trump revealed details of the deal, with major Asian indexes and European futures swinging between gains and losses. China’s Shanghai Composite Index slipped from a 10-year high, while US soybean futures were weaker. World stock markets from Wall Street to Tokyo had hit record highs leading up to the meeting on hopes of a breakthrough in a trade war between the world’s two largest economies that has upended supply chains and rocked global business confidence. The meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, lasted nearly two hours. Trump shook hands and escorted Xi to his car before the US president was given a red-carpet send-off at the airport. Trump repeatedly talked up the prospect of reaching agreement with Xi since US negotiators on Sunday said they had agreed a framework with China that will avoid 100 per cent US tariffs on Chinese goods and achieve a deferral of China’s export curbs on rare earths, a sector it dominates. But with both countries increasingly willing to play hardball over areas of economic and geopolitical competition, many questions remain about how long any trade detente may last. — Reuters",

    "text": "Education October 30, 2025 by \nBola Olajuwon and Victoria Amadi The Minister of Education, Dr. Maruf Tunji Alausa, has embarked on a comprehensive overhaul of the country’s education system since he took over the ministry, moving from the traditional structure towards a skills-focused curriculum and a sustainable education model.\n\n\n\nA major part of the reforms is the restructuring of the national curriculum for basic, senior secondary and technical education, which commenced this academic year.\n\n\n\nThe ministry had also added new vocational and trade subjects to the curriculum, including digital literacy, solar installation, agricultural entrepreneurship, and garment making. This is intended to entrench practical skills from an early age and prepare students for the demands of the modern job market.       \nAccording to the minister, the total number of subjects a student would offer would be streamlined across different grade levels to reduce “content overload” and enable deeper learning.\n\n\n\nThe government has converted federal science and technical colleges into modern technical colleges. This includes free tuition and stipends for students, with a curriculum that is 80 per cent practical and 20 per cent theoretical.     \nAlausa has also emphasised the need for ongoing education reforms to move beyond policy declarations and deliver practical outcomes that strengthen skills, innovation, and job creation among young people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the ultimate goal of the reforms is to ensure that students are not only educated but also equipped with the competencies required to thrive in a fast-changing global economy.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the Federal Government was working to align education with the needs of the labour market through curriculum review, improved teacher training, and investment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSO: Why petrol prices are high despite cheaper crude\nThe minister, at the National Education Group (NEG) Meeting in Abuja, noted that the future of the country depended on how well its education system produced citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlausa said: “Our reforms must go beyond the paperwork of policy; they must impact classrooms, teachers, and ultimately the learners. Education should not end with certificates but open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity.”\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the ministry is prioritising partnerships with the private sector and development agencies to expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research, and digital learning.\n\n\n\n “If we are to build a competitive economy, we must invest in the skills and knowledge base of our young people so that they can become drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NEG Meeting brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including policymakers, education administrators, academics, and development partners, to deliberate on strategies for improving education delivery and learning outcomes across all levels.\n\n\n\nParticipants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector.\n\n\n\nDuring the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole.\n\n\n\nCONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities\nThe President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nSunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation.\n\n\n\nReiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective.\n\n\n\nHe advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions. This, he said, would guarantee continuity and prevent reform fatigue.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Fed Govt releases N2.3bn to clear salary, promotion arrears of varsities workers  960,000 youths to get technical vocational training  English, maths remain compulsory for all O-level students, says Federal Goverment   \nSunmonu also advised that reforms should not be abandoned mid-stream, as being done previously due to administrative transitions or political changes.\n\n\n\n“Institutional continuity should be built into the reform framework, ensuring that every new administration inherits an ongoing national agenda rather than starting afresh,” he said.\n\n\n\nHe also called for a robust, transparent and accountable structure to underpin the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Regular progress audits, independent evaluations, and citizen-accessible reporting dashboards should be introduced to track performance and maintain public trust,” he added.\n\n\n\nDrawing from international best practices, the union’s boss called for the integration of the following: Public – Private Partnerships (PPP) for technical and vocational education, as seen in Singapore and Germany, industry-aligned curriculum design, ensuring that employers and innovators co-create learning modules, digital integration at all levels of education, not as a luxury but as a necessity for inclusion and global competitiveness, teacher professional development as a continuous process, linked to certification and incentives and outcome-based monitoring where focus shifts from input (funds spent, teachers hired) to measurable impact (skills gained, jobs created and  innovations birthed).\n\n\n\n“Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist\nAn education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it.\n\n\n\nOrji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nHe reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation.\n\n\n\n“I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms. Equipping students with skills and opportunities is crucial for their success in a fast-changing global economy.\n\n\n\n“I agree that education should not end with certificates, but rather open doors to creativity, productivity, and prosperity.

He opined that the country is, at the moment, in a displaced state, leading into retrogression, backwardness and underdevelopment.\n\n\n\nOffurum noted that the level of progress made by a country is dependent on the level of educational and skillful engagements of her citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Imopoly ASUP head affirmed that the minister recognises the essential roles that technological skills play in the nation’s development, which polytechnic and technological education propagates. He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more.\n\n\n\nOffurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate.\n\n\n\n“To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted.\n\n\n\nThese are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman\nAbia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money.

He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more.\n\n\n\nOffurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate.\n\n\n\n“To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process. There should be establishment of electoral colleges that would train and certify eligible voters during general elections, not allowing voting rights in the hands of hungry illiterates that are ready to sell their votes for five cups of rice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Once good people are voted into power, by good brains, good laws/policies would be made, that would revamp the ethos of our nation. Except reasonable people are in power, the quest for revitalisation of our educational sector, vis-a-vis the economy of our nation, including Alausa’s desires/pronouncements, will continue to be in the hands of God Almighty alone,” he noted.\n\n\n\nThese are beautiful ideas, says Abia State University ASUU Chairman\nAbia State University, ASUU Chairman, Mr. Isaac Udoh, said: “These are beautiful ideas. But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” According to him, the ministry is prioritising partnerships with the private sector and development agencies to expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research, and digital learning.\n\n\n\n “If we are to build a competitive economy, we must invest in the skills and knowledge base of our young people so that they can become drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NEG Meeting brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including policymakers, education administrators, academics, and development partners, to deliberate on strategies for improving education delivery and learning outcomes across all levels.\n\n\n\nParticipants also reviewed implementation progress on existing policies and explored sustainable models for financing and accountability in the education sector.\n\n\n\nDuring the meeting, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive and equitable education, assuring that reforms would focus on improving access, quality, and relevance to meet the aspirations of a growing youth population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that education remained the foundation of national prosperity, urging all stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure that reforms produced tangible benefits for learners and the nation as a whole.\n\n\n\nCONUA: There is need for funding consistency, adjustment for local realities\nThe President of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Mr. Niyi Sunmonu, hailed the minister’s position, describing it as a commendable step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nSunmonu noted that the minister’s emphasis on practical outcomes, skills development, and innovation aligns well with global trends in education reform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, for these reforms to deliver the intended impact, the CONUA boss stressed that a few key considerations must guide implementation.\n\n\n\nReiterating that the policy direction is a sound one, the CONUA’s boss advised that it must be followed through with consistency and must be adjusted for local realities as implementation unfolds. He added that the lessons from each stage of execution should inform adaptive planning, a feedback mechanism that ensures reforms remain relevant and effective.\n\n\n\nHe advised that funding stability is crucial to achieve this. He added that education reforms often collapse not because they lack vision, but because they lack consistent financial backing. He advised that the Federal Government should establish a predictable and ring-fenced funding mechanism supported by both public and private sector contributions.

He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it.\n\n\n\nOrji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nHe reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation.\n\n\n\n“I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms.

He stated that until the country assuages its larger work force from paper (certificate) carrying graduates to Graduate Attribute and Professional Competence (GAPC) workers, its developmental backwardness may continue to deepen more and more.\n\n\n\nOffurum buttressed that the voting choices of voters, plays a huge role in a nation’s overall development, hence the need to make the right choice of candidate.\n\n\n\n“To get it right in this regard, generalisation of elections of people into public offices should be stopped, in order to disallow ill-mannered brains from participating in the voting process.

But, is this not Nigeria? A lot of talk with minimal implementation. From where we are sitting, these conferences, seminars and what not will fetch a set of people money. Forgive my cynicism, but Nigeria is not good at causing programmes to leave drawing boards.” “Ultimately, these reforms will only succeed if driven by political will, institutional discipline, and a shared national commitment to education as the foundation of sustainable development,” Sunmonu, commended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere must be enough energy to drive the reform, says activist\nAn education activist, Mr. Emmanuel Orji, in an interview with The Nation, noted that the reforms in the education sector work when there is enough energy to drive it. He added that the energy with which the present administration seeks change is high, hence the need for funds, human capital and other resources required for it.\n\n\n\nOrji stressed that the focus on aligning education with the labour market’s needs, curriculum review, teacher training, and STEM education is a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nHe reaffirmed that partnerships with the private sector and development agencies will also help expand opportunities for technical and vocational education, research and digital learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrji further reiterated that the future of Nigeria depends on a well-functioning education system that produces citizens capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation.\n\n\n\n“I sincerely commend the Minister of Education for emphasising the need for practical outcomes in the ongoing education reforms.

    "title": "The Grand Egyptian Museum showcasing 50,000 artifacts is finally opening",
    "text": "CAIRO: After two decades of anticipation and countless delays, the Grand Egyptian Museum is finally having its grand reveal.\n\tThe museum, which is set to officially open Saturday, highlights Egypt’s ancient civilization and is a centerpiece of the government’s drive to boost the tourist industry, a major source of foreign currency in the cash-strapped country.\n\tLocated just outside Cairo next to the famed Giza Pyramids, the $1 billion mammoth facility is poised to become the world’s largest museum dedicated to a single civilization with over 50,000 artifacts detailing the life in ancient Egypt. By comparison, the Louvre Museum in Paris has about 35,000 pieces on display.\n\tThe museum is one of the mega-projects championed by President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, who since taking office in 2014 embarked on massive investments in infrastructure with the aim of reviving an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered by the unrest that followed the 2011 Arab Spring uprising.\n\tThe museum’s construction began in 2005, but work stopped for three years during the political turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising.\n\tThe grand opening was postponed multiple times, most recently in July this year because of conflicts in the Middle East. World leaders are expected to attend the opening ceremony Saturday.\n\tGiant building with a view of the Giza Pyramids\n\tDesigned by the Irish firm Heneghan Peng Architects, the museum, known as GEM, boasts a towering, triangular glass façade imitating the nearby pyramids.\n\tIn its entrance atrium stands the granite colossus of one of Egypt’s most famed pharaohs, Ramesses the Great. The 3,200-year-old, 11-meters-tall (36-foot-tall) statue was moved to the museum after decades of standing in the center of a traffic-clogged roundabout in front of Cairo’s main train station.\n\tFrom the atrium, a grand six-story staircase lined with ancient statues leads up to the main galleries and a view of the nearby pyramids. A bridge links the museum to the pyramids, allowing tourists to move between them either on foot or via electric, environment-friendly vehicles, according to museum officials.\n\tThe museum includes 24,000 square meters (258,000 square feet) of permanent exhibition space, a children’s museum and conference and educational facilities, and a commercial area as well as a large conservation center.\n\tThe 12 main galleries, which opened last year, exhibit antiquities spanning from prehistoric times to the Roman era, organized by era and by themes.\n\tMany of the 50,000 artifacts in the GEM were moved from the Egyptian Museum, a packed, century-old building in downtown Cairo’s Tahrir Square. Others were recently unearthed from ancient cemeteries, including the Saqqara necropolis, another complex of pyramids and tombs about 14 miles (22 kilometers) south of the museum.\n\tThe halls are equipped with advanced technology and feature multimedia presentations including mixed-reality shows to help explain ancient Egypt to new generations, said Ahmed Ghoneim, the museum’s CEO.\n\t“We’re using the language that the Gen Z uses right now,” he said in an interview. “Gen Z doesn’t use anymore the labels that we read as old people but rather use technology.”\n\tTutankhamun collection in one place for the first time\n\tSaturday’s grand opening will include the inauguration of two halls dedicated to the 5,000 artifacts from the collection of King Tutankhamun.\n\tThe collection is being displayed in its entirety for the first time since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered King Tut’s tomb in 1922 in the southern city of Luxor. The old Egyptian Museum didn’t have enough space to show all the tomb’s treasures at once.\n\tSome masterpieces were restored at the museum’s conservation center, including the boy pharaoh’s three funeral beds and six chariots, said Jailan Mohamed, chief restorer at the conservation center.\n\tThey will be displayed along with his golden throne, his gold-covered sarcophagus and his burial mask, made of gold, quartzite, lapis lazuli and colored glass. The mask’s beard was accidentally knocked off and hastily glued back on with epoxy in 2014, before a German-Egyptian team of experts fixed it the following year.\n\tAnother centerpiece of the museum is the 4,600-year-old solar boat of King Khufu, the pharaoh who is credited with building the Great Pyramid of Giza. The 43-meter-long (140-foot) wooden boat, discovered in the 1950s, was buried next to the Great Pyramid for Khufu — or Cheops as he is also known — to use in the afterlife. In 2021, it was moved from its display site by the pyramids into the Grand Egyptian Museum on a remote-controlled vehicle imported from Belgium.\n\tThe government hopes that the museum will revitalize tourism\n\tThe government hopes the museum will draw more tourists who will stay for a while and provide the foreign currency Egypt needs to shore up its economy.\n\tThe tourism sector suffered from years of political turmoil and violence following the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. In recent years, the sector has started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the effects of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine are a major source of tourists visiting Egypt.\n\tA record number of 15.7 million visited the country in 2024, according to official figures, and the government aims to attract 30 million visitors by 2032.\n\tAuthorities overhauled the whole area around the museum and the pyramids. Roads were paved and a metro station is being constructed outside the museum gates to ease access to the sites. An airport, Sphinx International Airport, was also opened west of Cairo — 40 minutes from the museum.\n\tHassan Allam, CEO of Hassan Allam Holding, the firm administering the museum, said they’re expecting between 15,000 and 20,000 visitors a day at the museum.\n\t“The world has been waiting … Everyone’s excited,” he said.",

    "title": "Trump says tariffs on China are dropping from 57% to 47% after talks on fentanyl curbs with Xi Jinping",
    "text": "ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump described his face-to-face with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday as a roaring success, saying he would cut tariffs on China, while Beijing had agreed to allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans. The president told reporters aboard Air Force One that the U.S. would lower tariffs implemented earlier this year as punishment on China for its selling of chemicals used to make fentanyl from 20% to 10%. That brings the total combined tariff rate on China down from 57% to 47% “I guess on the scale from 0 to 10, with ten being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,” Trump said. “I think it was a 12.” Trump said that he would go to China in April and Xi would come to the U.S. “some time after that.” The president said they also discussed the export of more advanced computer chips to China, saying that Nvidia would be in talks with Chinese officials. Trump said he could sign a trade deal with China “pretty soon.” Xi said Washington and Beijing would work to finalize their agreements to provide “peace of mind” to both countries and the rest of the world, according to a report on the meeting distributed by state media. “Both sides should take the long-term perspective into account, focusing on the benefits of cooperation rather than falling into a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation,” he said. Despite Trump’s optimism after a 100-minute meeting with Xi in South Korea, there continues to be the potential for major tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Both nations are seeking dominant places in manufacturing, developing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and shaping world affairs like Russia’s war in Ukraine. Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs since returning to the White House for a second term, combined with China’s retaliatory limits on exports of rare earth elements, gave the meeting newfound urgency. There is a mutual recognition that neither side wants to risk blowing up the world economy in ways that could jeopardize their own country’s fortunes. When the two were seated at the start of the meeting, Xi read prepared remarks that stressed a willingness to work together despite differences. “Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other,” he said through a translator. “It is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then.” There was a slight difference in translation as China’s Xinhua News Agency reported Xi as telling Trump that having some differences is inevitable. The leaders met in Busan, South Korea, a port city about 76 kilometers (47 miles) south from Gyeongju, the main venue for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. In the days leading up to the meeting, U.S. officials signaled that Trump did not intend to make good on a recent threat to impose an additional 100% import tax on Chinese goods, and China showed signs it was willing to relax its export controls on rare earths and also buy soybeans from America. Officials from both countries met earlier this week in Kuala Lumpur to lay the groundwork for their leaders. Afterward, China’s top trade negotiator Li Chenggang said they had reached a “preliminary consensus,” a statement affirmed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who said there was “ a very successful framework.” Shortly before the meeting on Thursday, Trump posted on Truth Social that the meeting would be the “G2,” a recognition of America and China’s status as the world’s biggest economies. The Group of Seven and Group of 20 are other forums of industrialized nations. But while those summits often happen at luxury spaces, this meeting took place in humbler surroundings: Trump and Xi met in a small gray building with a blue roof on a military base adjacent to Busan’s international airport. The anticipated detente has given investors and businesses caught between the two nations a sense of relief. The U.S. stock market has climbed on the hopes of a trade framework coming out of the meeting. Pressure points remain for both US and China\nTrump has outward confidence that the grounds for a deal are in place, but previous negotiations with China this year in Geneva, Switzerland and London had a start-stop quality to them. The initial promise of progress has repeatedly given way to both countries seeking a better position against the other. “The proposed deal on the table fits the pattern we’ve seen all year: short-term stabilization dressed up as strategic progress,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “Both sides are managing volatility, calibrating just enough cooperation to avert crisis while the deeper rivalry endures.” The U.S. and China have each shown they believe they have levers to pressure the other, and the past year has demonstrated that tentative steps forward can be short-lived. For Trump, that pressure comes from tariffs. China had faced new tariffs this year totaling 30%, of which 20% were tied to its role in fentanyl production. But the tariff rates have been volatile. In April, he announced plans to jack the rate on Chinese goods to 145%, only to abandon those plans as markets recoiled. Then, on Oct. 10, Trump threatened a 100% import tax because of China’s rare earth restrictions. That figure, including past tariffs, would now be 47% “effective immediately,” Trump told reporters on Thursday. Xi has his own chokehold on the world economy because China is the top producer and processor of the rare earth minerals needed to make fighter jets, robots, electric vehicles and other high-tech products. China had tightened export restrictions on Oct. 9, repeating a cycle in which each nation jockeys for an edge only to back down after more trade talks. What might also matter is what happens directly after their talks. Trump plans to return to Washington, while Xi plans to stay on in South Korea to meet with regional leaders during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which officially begins on Friday. “Xi sees an opportunity to position China as a reliable partner and bolster bilateral and multilateral relations with countries frustrated by the U.S. administration’s tariff policy,” said Jay Truesdale, a former State Department official who is CEO of TD International, a risk and intelligence advisory firm. ___ Ken Moritsugu in Beijing and Seung Min Kim and Michelle Price in Washington contributed to this report.

    "title": "Florence Press Conference Confirms ECB Remains Comfortable in Its Good Place",
    "text": "Even a change of scenery has done nothing to change the European Central Bank’s current wait-and-see stance. Florence, where the ECB met today for its only annual meeting outside of Frankfurt, is apparently also this ’good place’, the central bank’s well-known pseudonym for comfortably keeping interest rates on hold. ECB President Christine Lagarde even called it a ‘magnificent’ place – Florence, that is, not rates. The comments at the press conference confirmed once again that the ECB has no intention to leave its ‘good place’ any time soon. We had feared a rather uneventful press conference. What should we say? We hate to be right… Anyhow, here are a few interesting remarks made by Lagarde: On the ECB’s risk assessment, the introductory statement had the most remarkable change compared with September. Last month, the ECB had still talked about risks to the growth outlook that had become “more balanced”; today, it refrained from qualifying any balance of risk. Instead, the central bank had a somewhat more extensive list of upside and downside risks to the growth outlook. Lagarde even said that some of the downside risks had abated. When asked whether this was a sign of an upcoming shift in the balance of risk, the ECB’s President pointed out that it had already narrowed the risks at the September meeting. Funnily enough, back at the September meeting, there had been no mention of a narrowing of risks. Supply chain disruptions. Lagarde referred to a discussion on potential supply chain bottlenecks that could still arise as a result of the latest tensions between China and the EU on microchips and rare earths in general. Risks to inflation. As in the past, the ECB didn’t provide an assessment of the balance of risks to inflation. However, during the press conference, Lagarde mentioned different positions, views and analyses regarding inflation within the Governing Council. These differing views do exist, despite a unanimous decision to keep rates on hold today. A particular concern remains service inflation, which the ECB has often labelled as being too high. Looking ahead, today’s meeting has done nothing to change the view that the bar for yet another rate cut from the ECB is high. In fact, the Bank currently feels very comfortable in its ‘good place’. With the ECB’s own growth forecasts indicating that the eurozone economy will grow by slightly more than 1% each year and inflation will settle down to 2% over the next few years, there is indeed very little reason to change its monetary policy stance. At the same time, there are still valid dovish arguments that could force the central bank to cut again at the December meeting. Just think of the delayed adverse impact of US tariffs, the stronger euro exchange rate, French politics or a delay in Germany’s fiscal stimulus. If any of these downside risks materialise, we can expect the ECB to engage in one or two more rate cuts. On this point, it remains important to note that the current ECB inflation forecast for 2027 includes a 0.2ppt impact from the introduction of the ETS2 system. Needless to say, any delay in the implementation could have implications for the ECB as it would increase the risk of inflation undershooting. Even if Lagarde tried to downplay this issue during the press conference. In any case, even if the ECB seems to rest more comfortably on its laurels than before, the December staff projections will be crucial and could still invade its good place. If the 2028 inflation forecasts come in sub-1.7%, the likelihood of yet another rate cut would increase. More generally speaking, Lagarde didn’t give away any hints at what’s next for the ECB. Maybe the strongest message came from the colours of the President’s scarf, which – at least to us – resembled the French flag. For the rest, today’s meeting was another illustration that the ECB has no intention whatsoever of leaving its ‘good place’ any time soon. *** Disclaimer: This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user’s means, financial situation or investment objectives.

We hate to be right… Anyhow, here are a few interesting remarks made by Lagarde: On the ECB’s risk assessment, the introductory statement had the most remarkable change compared with September. Last month, the ECB had still talked about risks to the growth outlook that had become “more balanced”; today, it refrained from qualifying any balance of risk. Instead, the central bank had a somewhat more extensive list of upside and downside risks to the growth outlook. Lagarde even said that some of the downside risks had abated. When asked whether this was a sign of an upcoming shift in the balance of risk, the ECB’s President pointed out that it had already narrowed the risks at the September meeting. Funnily enough, back at the September meeting, there had been no mention of a narrowing of risks. Supply chain disruptions. Lagarde referred to a discussion on potential supply chain bottlenecks that could still arise as a result of the latest tensions between China and the EU on microchips and rare earths in general. Risks to inflation. As in the past, the ECB didn’t provide an assessment of the balance of risks to inflation. However, during the press conference, Lagarde mentioned different positions, views and analyses regarding inflation within the Governing Council. These differing views do exist, despite a unanimous decision to keep rates on hold today. A particular concern remains service inflation, which the ECB has often labelled as being too high. Looking ahead, today’s meeting has done nothing to change the view that the bar for yet another rate cut from the ECB is high. In fact, the Bank currently feels very comfortable in its ‘good place’. With the ECB’s own growth forecasts indicating that the eurozone economy will grow by slightly more than 1% each year and inflation will settle down to 2% over the next few years, there is indeed very little reason to change its monetary policy stance. At the same time, there are still valid dovish arguments that could force the central bank to cut again at the December meeting. Just think of the delayed adverse impact of US tariffs, the stronger euro exchange rate, French politics or a delay in Germany’s fiscal stimulus. If any of these downside risks materialise, we can expect the ECB to engage in one or two more rate cuts. On this point, it remains important to note that the current ECB inflation forecast for 2027 includes a 0.2ppt impact from the introduction of the ETS2 system. Needless to say, any delay in the implementation could have implications for the ECB as it would increase the risk of inflation undershooting. Even if Lagarde tried to downplay this issue during the press conference. In any case, even if the ECB seems to rest more comfortably on its laurels than before, the December staff projections will be crucial and could still invade its good place. If the 2028 inflation forecasts come in sub-1.7%, the likelihood of yet another rate cut would increase. More generally speaking, Lagarde didn’t give away any hints at what’s next for the ECB. Maybe the strongest message came from the colours of the President’s scarf, which – at least to us – resembled the French flag. For the rest, today’s meeting was another illustration that the ECB has no intention whatsoever of leaving its ‘good place’ any time soon. *** Disclaimer: This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user’s means, financial situation or investment objectives.

    "title": "Glen Burnie Bancorp Announces Third Quarter 2025 Results",
    "text": "Highlights for the Third Quarter of 2025: Year-to-date through September 30, 2025, net earnings were $66,000 compared to a net loss of $72,000 during the same nine-month period in 2024. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2025 was $0.02, compared to a diluted loss per share of $(0.02) during the same period in 2024. \"We are pleased with our results for this quarter as our strategic initiatives that were started over a year ago, continue to improve our balance sheet position and earnings. We are also excited to complete the acquisition of VAWM as we believe that our new subsidiary will help grow our non-interest income, increase our ability to serve new markets, and add a cornerstone product to our expanding line of products and services,” said Mark C. Hanna, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our strategic priorities continue to focus on increasing new revenue sources by growing our client relationships and becoming more operationally efficient. Achieving these objectives will expand our return on assets and capital.” Mr. Hanna added, \"We were also very pleased to see that our deposit base and cost of funding continues to remain competitive and stable while seeing good growth in our loan revenues. With strong liquidity and ample capital, we are very excited about our future and the benefits our strategic initiatives are beginning to produce.” Loan Portfolio Quality/Allowance for Loan Losses The Bank’s asset quality metrics continue to be very good due to our focus on disciplined lending practices. The non-performing loans ratio as of September 30, 2025, was 0.56%, up 40 basis points from the third quarter 2024 and up slightly by 5 basis points from June 30, 2025. During the third quarter of 2025, the Bank had net charge-offs of $93,000 or 0.17% to average loans, as compared to net recoveries of $44,000 or -0.09% in the third quarter 2024, and net charge-offs of $45,000 or 0.09% in the second quarter of 2025. Provision expense was $44,000 in the third quarter 2025 compared to $105,000 for the third quarter 2024, and $79,000 in the second quarter 2025. The Bank’s allowance for loan losses to loans was 1.19% for the third quarter 2025, a decline of 0.02% from the second quarter of 2025 and a decline of 0.14% from the third quarter of 2024. Mr. Hanna noted, \"We continue to see and experience very good credit results and indicators in our markets, while our non-performing assets remain at lower levels. Our allowance for credit losses at 1.19% of loans, highlights our conservative stance on maintaining a healthy reserve on our balance sheet.” Balance Sheet Total loans were $215.3 million at September 30, 2025, an increase of $8.3 million, or 4.0%, from the third quarter of 2024, and $2.0 million from the second quarter of 2025. During the third quarter 2025, total average loans increased $7.3 million from the second quarter 2025 as a result of growth in commercial real estate loans of $2.4 million, $3.8 million of growth in the C&I portfolio, and a $1.1 million increase in consumer loans (automobile). Total deposits were $329.1 million at September 30, 2025, an increase of $14.8 million, or 4.7%, from the third quarter of 2024, and $11.8 million from the second quarter of 2025. Non-interest-bearing deposits, which are 33% of total deposits, were down by $8.6 million, or 7.4%, from the third quarter of 2024, and were relatively unchanged from the second quarter of 2025. Interest-bearing deposits ended at $221.7 million for the third quarter of 2025, a $23.4 million increase from the third quarter 2024, or 11.8%, and an increase of $11.4 million from the second quarter 2025. The Bank’s communities and markets remain very competitive for deposits by customers who are very rate sensitive. Interest-bearing cost of deposits increased on a linked quarter basis to 1.91% in the third quarter of 2025 from 1.78% due to the shift of deposit balances from lower cost deposits to the Bank’s higher rate money market accounts and CDs. Total cost of funds, including noninterest sources decreased 0.04% on a linked quarter basis to 1.32%. During the quarter the bank paid off all advances from the FHLB, which were $30 million at the end of the third quarter 2024 and $13.0 million at the end of the second quarter of 2025. Mr. Hanna commented, \"We are glad to see continued growth in our deposit base as those deposits are a strength of our Bank and a big contributor to our strong liquidity. As of September 30, 2025, our liquidity sources improved to the point where we paid off all FHLB advances by the end of the quarter. We still have many sources for additional liquidity in the form of $50.9 million in borrowing capacity with the FHLB, open pledging capacity of our securities portfolio of $56.8 million, $34.6 million in borrowing capacity with FRB, and additional access to other wholesale funding of $123 million. This additional liquidity capacity will provide the funding we need to create a more customer-based balance sheet as our reliance on investment securities continues to decline while growing commercial loan relationships within our markets and the communities we serve.” The investment securities available for sale was $104.1 million, after the fair value adjustment of $22.3 million at September 30, 2025, with a yield of 2.23% for the third quarter 2025, down $15.8 million from the third quarter of 2024, and down $0.4 million from the second quarter of 2025. The effective duration of the securities portfolio is 7.3 years. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) of $16.2 million was up from $15.7 million when compared to the third quarter of 2024, and down from the second quarter of 2025 by $1.7 million. Changes in the Bank’s AOCL in the investment portfolio are attributable to changes in the economy as bonds with longer maturities are more sensitive to interest rate changes. The Bank does not intend to sell nor buy any new securities as our strategic direction is to grow our balance sheet through new loans instead of increasing our reliance on the securities portfolio. Each of the regulatory capital ratios for the Bank exceeds the well capitalized minimum levels currently required by regulatory statute. At September 30, 2025, the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios (Leverage, Tier I Risk Based and Total Risk Based) were 9.67%, 14.82 %, and 15.96% respectively. These compared to the ratios as of June 30, 2025, of 9.59%, 14.91%, and 16.06% and to September 30, 2024, of 10.11%, 15.47%, and 16.72%, respectively. Revenue Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin Net interest income was $2.8 million for both the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, compared to net interest income of $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2025. The net interest margin for the third quarter of 2025, on a tax equivalent basis, was 3.24% up 10 basis points from the third quarter of 2024 and up 11 basis points from the second quarter of 2025. The increase in the Bank’s net interest margin is due a continued change in the mix of earning assets from lower yielding assets to higher yielding loans. Yields on total loans improved by 15 basis points to 5.73% on a linked quarter basis and were up 4 basis points from the third quarter of 2024, while the total cost of funds was 1.32% in both the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, but down 4 basis points over the second quarter of 2025 from 1.36%. Total earning assets were $354.9 million, down $11.3 million from the third quarter 2024 and down $4.4 million from the second quarter 2025. Mr. Hanna commented, \"We continue to see our mix of earning assets move from cash and securities to a higher percentage of loans. A year ago, in the third quarter of 2024, our loans were 56% of our earning assets where today at the end of the third quarter of 2025, loans represented 61% of our total earning assets, up from 58% in the second quarter of 2025. This is an important and intentional shift in our balance sheet to work around the existing securities portfolio structure.” Non-Interest Income Non-interest income in the third quarter of 2025 was $571,000 compared to $354,000 in the third quarter of 2024 and $220,000 in the second quarter of 2025. Mortgage fees from VAWM for the third quarter of 2025 were $192,000, which was the primary cause of the increased non-interest income. The Bank anticipates continued increases in its non-interest income in the form of mortgage fees due to the acquisition of VAWM. Non-Interest Expense Noninterest expense totaled $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, up $0.3 million from the third quarter of 2024, and relatively equal to the second quarter of 2025. Most of the increase from the third quarter of 2024 was related to non-recurring legal and professional fees from the acquisition of VAWM as well as new operating expenses from VAWM. Salary and related employment benefits were up $211,000 from the third quarter 2024 primarily due to increased headcount at the bank in the latter part of 2024 and new salaries and benefit costs at VAWM. When compared to the second quarter 2025, these costs were down by $161,000 as reductions in headcount in the first and second quarters of 2025 are now being recognized. Salaries and related benefits at VAWM for the third quarter of 2025 were $139,000. Occupancy and equipment expenses, legal, accounting and professional fees, and data processing services combined were up by $89,000 from the third quarter 2024 and up $188,000 from the second quarter 2025 primarily due to increases in legal and professional fees related to the VAWM acquisition and interim finance and accounting consulting help. All other expenses were relatively flat when compared to the third quarter 2024 and second quarter 2025. Acquisition Summary - VA Wholesale Mortgage Incorporated As of the close of business on August 15, 2025, the Bank, a Maryland-chartered bank, completed the acquisition of VAWM, a Virginia corporation engaged in residential mortgage banking, lending, and brokerage services, from Eric Tan, its sole shareholder (\"Seller”). Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Bank purchased 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of VAWM for a total purchase price of $750,000, payable under a 36-month, interest-free promissory note. The note provides for monthly forgiveness of one-thirty-sixth of the balance over the term, subject to continuing employment and other specified conditions. Amortization of the note will be treated as compensation expense. In addition, the Seller is entitled to post-closing contingent consideration (\"earn-out”) equal to 33% of VAWM’s net earnings plus 0.04% of closed-loan volume for a period of three years following the closing date, estimated to be $298,000 based on historical production and future growth. Earn-out payments are to be determined annually based on VAWM’s financial results, with supporting statements delivered after each year-end. Concurrent with closing, the Seller entered into an employment agreement with the Bank, continuing to serve in a management role to support the integration of the mortgage operations into the Bank’s business. The acquisition was affected through a private stock purchase and did not involve the issuance of any shares by the Bank. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase of a business under ASC 805, with VAWM becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank. The acquisition expands the Bank’s retail mortgage banking capabilities within its existing Mid-Atlantic market footprint. Further details of the financial impacts will be included in the Bancorp’s Financial Statements and Notes in Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2025.

    "title": "Greece and Canada Explore Year-Round Direct Flight Service from Athens to Boost their Tourism and Business Ties",
    "text": "Published on\nNovember 1, 2025 With the view to upgrading the Greek-Canadian bilateral relations, Greek Minister of Infrastructure and Transport Christos Dimas met with Canadian Transport Minister Steven MacKinnon to discuss a year-round, direct flight between Athens and Canada. The talks came during the Delphi Economic Forum Toronto Edition, where both countries discussed ways to deepen cooperation on aviation, logistics, digital infrastructure, and sustainable mobility. This new airlift will add even more force to tourism exchange between the two nations, which will also create new opportunities for business exchange and economic development.A Strategic Move to Enhance Tourism and ConnectivityThe proposal for a direct Athens–Canada flight comes at a time when both Greece and Canada are working to expand their tourism offerings and economic ties. As tourism demand continues to rise in both countries, establishing a direct air link would significantly reduce travel time and costs, benefiting both tourists and business professionals. With Canada’s large Greek diaspora and Greece’s rich cultural and natural offerings, the new service would not only attract more tourists but also strengthen cultural exchanges and mutual understanding between the two nations.Advertisement  Minister Dimas emphasized that the proposed route would help position Greece as a gateway to Europe for Canadian travelers, facilitating access to not only Athens but also Greek islands like Santorini, Mykonos, and Crete. At the same time, it would provide Canadians with a convenient link to explore the rich cultural and natural attractions of Greece. By improving connectivity, Greece and Canada can work together to bolster the tourism sector, creating sustainable growth and offering unique travel experiences for visitors from both countries.Strengthening Economic and Trade RelationsWhile tourism is a key focus of this initiative, the direct Athens–Canada route will also have a substantial economic impact, particularly in trade relations. The proposed flight will help facilitate business exchanges and trade opportunities between Greece and Canada, particularly in industries such as shipping, agriculture, renewable energy, and technology.Advertisement  By improving air connectivity, both countries will benefit from easier travel for business professionals, enabling smoother cross-border collaborations and improving the movement of goods and services. For example, Greek exporters will have enhanced access to the Canadian market, while Canadian businesses will find it easier to connect with partners in Greece and Southern Europe. This increased connectivity could also lead to new investment opportunities and a deeper integration of Greek and Canadian economies.A Focus on Sustainable Aviation and Eco-Friendly TravelBoth ministers highlighted the importance of sustainable mobility as part of this potential air service. The new flight will feature the latest in eco-friendly aviation technology, focusing on reducing carbon emissions and improving fuel efficiency. Greece’s tourism sector has increasingly prioritized sustainable travel in recent years, and the launch of the Athens–Canada route will align with these efforts by providing a green travel option for visitors.Advertisement  The airline operating the route is expected to use fuel-efficient aircraft, such as the Airbus A320neo or A321neo, which are designed to significantly reduce CO2 emissions compared to older models. The focus on sustainability extends to the tourism experience as well, with eco-friendly accommodations and activities in Greece being promoted as part of the country’s push to become a leader in sustainable tourism. This aligns with Canada’s commitment to reducing its environmental footprint, particularly in the aviation and travel industries.Cultural and Educational Exchange OpportunitiesThe Athens–Canada direct route will not only foster tourism and business exchanges, but will also open doors for cultural and educational opportunities. Greek students and academics will benefit from easier access to Canadian universities and institutions, while Canadian travelers will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in Greek culture, history, and art. The two countries have long shared cultural ties, and a direct flight will only deepen these connections, allowing for greater collaboration in the arts, education, and heritage preservation.Cultural and heritage tourism in Greece is flourishing, and the new service would provide Canadians with better access to Greek heritage sites, including the Acropolis, Delphi, and Olympia, as well as the UNESCO World Heritage Sites found across the Greek islands.Supporting Sustainable Tourism Growth in GreeceGreece’s tourism sector continues to grow, with the country consistently attracting millions of visitors every year. However, the government is increasingly focusing on sustainable growth and destination management, ensuring that tourism development is environmentally responsible and socially beneficial for local communities. The Athens–Canada direct flight would play a vital role in supporting these goals, as it would promote regional tourism beyond the popular islands and larger cities, encouraging travelers to visit rural areas, archaeological sites, and small towns.Furthermore, the direct air connection could help reduce the pressure on overcrowded tourist destinations, by providing access to lesser-known regions and spreading tourism activity more evenly throughout the country. This sustainable tourism model aligns with the broader vision of creating long-term economic benefits for local communities, while also ensuring the preservation of Greece’s natural beauty and cultural heritage.Future Outlook: Expanding Greece-Canada Tourism and Trade RelationsIn the future, the Athens–Canada route is expected to act as a springboard to further growth in tourism and economic cooperation between Greece and Canada. The government and tourism authorities will continue to work closely with the airlines, travel agencies, and business partners to ensure that the route is successful and expands the connections to other key Canadian cities.The potential success of the Athens–Canada route will, in turn, encourage more regional air connectivity initiatives within the European and North American tourism markets. The ongoing cooperation between Greece and Canada sends the signal of commitment toward strengthening ties and building a future of sustainable and mutually beneficial tourism and economic exchanges.Advertisement  Share On:Tags: Athens Canada direct flights for tourism, Greece Canada direct route for business and tourism growth, Greece Canada tourism and business ties, sustainable air travel Greece Canada 2025, year-round direct flight Athens CanadaSubscribe to our NewslettersFollow Travel And Tour World in Google News The proposal for a direct Athens–Canada flight comes at a time when both Greece and Canada are working to expand their tourism offerings and economic ties.

    "text": "Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has approved Punjab Protection of Ownership and Immovable Property Ordinance 2025 to deal with those who grab the property of the people. Chairing a meeting in Lahore, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has established Dispute Resolution Committees under Ordinance for the petitioners who have been going through the courts for years. Now every land grabbing case in Punjab will be decided by the Dispute Resolution Committee in just 90 days. A special tribunal set up under the chairmanship of a retired judge of the High Court will hear the appeal against the decision of the Dispute Resolution Committee. The special tribunal will also be bound to decide the appeal within 90. According to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s vision of a state at the doorstep of the people, under the new ordinance, in every district of Punjab Dispute Resolution Committee to be established. Under the new justice system in Punjab, the Dispute Resolution Committee will resolve the issue of possession of private property before going to court.

A new example of state writ and protection of public property rights established and land will be recovered from the possession mafia within 24 hours after the decision of the case. Recommendation to hire Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (PERA) to free possession from those who grab the property of the people was reviewed in the meeting. Proposals for digital records and social media live streaming for transparency were also reviewed. Maryam Nawaz said no one will snatch anyone’s land in Punjab now, a mother-like state stands with every weak. Whoever owns it has the right to own it and the chapter of the mafia has been closed forever, Maryam Nawaz said.

    "title": "OpenAI Launches Paid Tier for Sora AI Video Generations",
    "text": "In a move that signals the maturation of artificial intelligence tools from experimental novelties to revenue-generating platforms, OpenAI has introduced a paid tier for its Sora video generation app, allowing users to purchase additional credits beyond daily free limits. This development, announced recently, marks a pivotal shift for the company as it seeks to balance accessibility with financial sustainability in the competitive AI space. According to reports, users can now buy bundles of 10 extra video generations for $4, a nominal fee that extends the app’s utility for heavy users who exhaust their complimentary allocations. The Sora app, which debuted on iOS with capabilities to create stunning AI-generated videos from text prompts, initially offered unlimited free generations to foster adoption and feedback. However, as user numbers swell, OpenAI is recalibrating its model to manage computational costs and prevent abuse. Bill Peebles, Sora’s chief, explained in interviews that this pay-for-more approach is the first step in a broader monetization strategy, with plans to reduce free daily limits in the coming months. Monetization Strategies Taking Shape Industry observers note that this pricing structure aligns with OpenAI’s evolving business model, reminiscent of how it transitioned ChatGPT from free access to subscription-based Plus and Enterprise tiers. The Verge detailed how the company is positioning Sora not just as a creative tool but as a potential economic ecosystem, including future licensing for copyrighted characters and cameo features. This could open revenue streams from partnerships with content creators and media firms, potentially transforming Sora into a marketplace for AI-enhanced video production. Moreover, the introduction of paid credits addresses the high operational expenses associated with AI video generation, which demands significant GPU resources. Sources indicate that while the current free tier allows around 30 generations per day, reductions are imminent to encourage upgrades, a tactic echoed in gaming and software industries where freemium models drive premium conversions. Implications for Users and Creators For creative professionals, this change could democratize access to advanced tools while introducing barriers for casual users. Filmmakers and marketers, who rely on iterative generation for projects, may welcome the option to scale up without waiting for resets, but concerns about equity arise. Mashable highlighted user reactions, with some praising the affordability of the $4 bundle, while others worry it foreshadows steeper paywalls that could stifle innovation in underserved communities. OpenAI’s executives have emphasized that this is part of building a “new Sora economy,” including monetized features like reusable avatars and video stitching. As Business Insider reported, the company envisions users earning from their creations, perhaps through integrated marketplaces, blending AI generation with blockchain-like royalty systems. The Broader AI Industry Shift This pivot reflects broader trends in the AI sector, where companies like Google and Meta are also exploring hybrid free-paid models to recoup investments in training massive models. Analysts suggest OpenAI’s strategy could set precedents for how generative AI tools evolve from hype to profitable ventures, especially amid regulatory scrutiny over energy consumption and intellectual property. Critics, however, point to potential downsides, such as increased digital divides. Mint noted that while the iOS-exclusive rollout limits accessibility, expansions to other platforms are planned, potentially broadening reach. As OpenAI navigates these waters, the success of Sora’s paid features will likely influence investor confidence and competitive responses. Future Horizons and Challenges Looking ahead, OpenAI plans to integrate more advanced capabilities, such as higher-resolution outputs and collaborative editing, which could justify premium pricing. Yet, challenges remain, including competition from open-source alternatives and ethical concerns over deepfakes. Engadget reported on the company’s intent to introduce licensing options, allowing brands to protect and profit from their IP within Sora’s ecosystem. Ultimately, this monetization layer underscores OpenAI’s ambition to lead in AI video, turning creative potential into a sustainable business. As the platform matures, it may redefine content creation, blending human ingenuity with machine efficiency in ways that benefit both innovators and the bottom line.",

    "text": "Governor Ahmed Aliyu of Sokoto State has commissioned the newly rehabilitated and constructed Mabera Road Network, describing the project as a landmark step in his administration’s drive to transform the state’s infrastructure and improve residents’ quality of life. Speaking at the inauguration ceremony in Sokoto, Governor Aliyu stated that the project symbolised the fulfilment of his administration’s promise to deliver people-oriented developments that connect communities and drive economic growth. “This moment is not merely about the concrete and asphalt beneath our feet; it is about the fulfilment of a promise,” the governor said. “We are building a Sokoto State where infrastructure works for the people, connects communities, and unlocks economic potential.” He commended the residents of Mabera for their patience and cooperation during the construction period, noting that their support had made the successful completion of the project possible. The governor also lauded ZBCC Nigeria Limited, the contractors that handled the project, for adhering to high technical standards and delivering the job within schedule. “You have acquitted yourselves creditably and delivered a standard we are proud of,” he stated. Highlighting the economic and social value of the new road network, the governor said it would ease transportation difficulties, promote commerce, and enhance connectivity within Sokoto and neighbouring areas. “No economic or social program can succeed without functional infrastructure,” Aliyu noted. “By investing in this road, we are not only easing movement today but securing the economic prosperity of Mabera for tomorrow.” While reaffirming his administration’s commitment to continuous infrastructural renewal across the state, the governor pledged to keep channelling resources into projects that directly improve living standards and open up opportunities for the people. He expressed appreciation to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his leadership and ongoing reforms in the economy and security sectors, assuring that Sokoto would continue to align with the President’s development agenda. “With this commissioning, we are not just opening a road; we are opening a pathway to a brighter future,” he said. In his remarks, Abdulaziz Abubakar Yari, former Zamfara State Governor, praised Governor Ahmed Aliyu for embarking on people-oriented projects, noting that the people of Sokoto State are proud of his leadership. The governor then inaugurated the Mabera Road Network for public use, marking a significant milestone in the state’s infrastructural development. In a symbolic gesture, the governor renamed Katin Sanni Road within the Mabera community after Senator Abdulaziz Yari, the special guest of honor at the event, who is a former Zamfara Governor.",

    "title": "Impound, Don’t Go Nuclear",
    "text": "Eliminating the Senate filibuster would be a boon for the Democrats. President Trump, after completing his highly successful trade and diplomacy trip to the Indo-Pacific region, where he outfoxed and cornered Communist China in so many areas, then wrote a long Truth Social note where he advocated for ending the government shutdown with what is called the “nuclear option.” He wrote: “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW.” I can surely understand Mr. Trump’s frustration with the radical Democratic Party that is being driven by the Mamdani-AOC-Bernie Sanders socialist wing. Yet I do not think ending the filibuster is a good idea. Speaking as someone who strongly supports the president’s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation, energy dominance, reciprocal free trade, closing the border and so forth, I think ending the filibuster would do great damage to those pro-growth policies, which miraculously passed under “one big, beautiful” bill. Mr. Trump himself admits in his Truth Social post that the Democrats fought hard to end the filibuster, but failed. He even notes that ending the filibuster would at some point allow Democrats to pack the Supreme Court, make Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico new states, thereby picking up four senate seats and many House seats and electoral votes from those ultra-liberal places. The Committee to Unleash Prosperity adds to the list it would’ve passed without the filibuster: A national voter ID ban, the Green New Deal, card check for union elections, a $15 minimum wage, a cap-and-trade national energy tax, completely socialized medicine, and the PRO Act’s forced unionization. Let’s not go there. I have a much better idea: presidential impoundment. Mr. Trump’s budget director, Russell Vought, is ready to pull the trigger on non-essential federal employees who will remain non-essential, forever. I call it DOGE 2.0. In short, keep the non-essential non-essential; that’s existential. And all those pork-barrel Democratic spending items that President Biden lined up for his re-election last year, that stuff was so bad it even gives waste, fraud, and abuse a bad name. I’ll be polite: they’re all non-essential. Because the government is presently unfunded, the chief executive has the authority to impound personnel and non-entitlement programs. While Mr. Vought has his weapon locked and loaded, he’s being held back by a lower court judge who has enjoined the administration from taking these actions. Yet all that is on appeal and is likely to be overturned. Unquestionably, Mr. Trump as the chief of the executive branch has the inherent constitutional power to impound during this period. If Democrats come back to power without a filibuster rule to restrain them, they will spend, tax, and regulate a quadrillion dollars worth of programs that will destroy the economy. On the other hand, if Mr. Trump exercises his executive authority to impound non-essentials, he will greatly slim down the size and scope of the federal government, while reducing deficits and debt along the way. In that scenario, economic prosperity will flourish almost more than anybody can possibly imagine. From Mr. Kudlow’s broadcast on Fox Business Network.",

    "title": "PA premier says Ramallah best placed to lead postwar Gaza, despite Israeli obstacles",
    "text": "Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa made the case on Thursday for Ramallah to play a leading role in the postwar management of Gaza, arguing that it is best positioned to do so despite the obstacles put up by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. “The Palestinian Authority is important, not only for keep[ing] the West Bank stable, but also for restoring the situation in Gaza,” Mustafa said during a virtual event with the Washington-based Brookings Institution think tank. “Despite all the challenges, despite all the difficulties, despite the issues that need reform — which we are working on — the only party that can get things back on track with support from international partners is the Palestinian Authority.” While much of the international community backs the PA replacing Hamas as the governing body in Gaza, Israel has maintained an effective veto over the transition, claiming that the Ramallah-based body is irredeemably corrupt and encourages violence against Israel. US President Donald Trump’s administration has sometimes been similarly critical of the PA, and even barred PA President Mahmoud Abbas from entering the US for the UN General Assembly last month. But as key Arab stakeholders have conditioned their support in the post-war management of Gaza on a role for a reformed PA, Washington appears to be slightly adapting its approach, allowing Abbas to participate in a conference of world leaders earlier this month in Egypt, where Trump was seen warmly embracing the PA leader. A longtime economic adviser to Abbas who previously served as deputy prime minister and economy minister, in addition to heading the Palestine Investment Fund and holding senior positions at the World Bank, Mustafa was appointed prime minister last year amid mounting calls for reform of the PA, which hasn’t held parliamentary elections since 2006 and presidential elections since 2005. He used the relatively rare appearance before an American audience to lay out the challenges the PA faces and the reforms that he has been implementing. Mustafa began by highlighting the over 1,000 checkpoints that the IDF has sprung up throughout the West Bank that have significantly curbed Palestinian movement, hampering the West Bank economy as a result. Israel says the measures are needed to maintain the security of settlers living in the territory amid efforts by Palestinian terror groups to target civilians and soldiers. The PA premier went on to highlight the over $3 billion in funds that the Israeli government has been withholding from the PA, which “has been making our economic life extremely difficult.” Due to the PA’s sub-state status, the Oslo Accords stipulate that Israel collect clearance revenues on the authority’s behalf and transfer those funds on a monthly basis to Ramallah. The PA is heavily reliant on the funds, which make up a majority of its annual budget. Israel has repeatedly withheld such funds, citing the PA’s welfare payments to convicted terrorists and their families, as well as the relatives of dead attackers, with Jerusalem saying the practice directly rewards terror. Abbas signed a decree in February ending the policy of payments to prisoners based on the length of their sentence. While documents obtained by The Times of Israel indicate that the old system has indeed been scrapped, Israel claims it remains in place, but has yet to offer proof on the matter. The lack of funds has meant public sector employees have missed out on 13 months of salary payments over the last three years alone, Mustafa said. Public school teachers have gone on strike due to partially paid salaries, thus causing a delay to the start of the school year. Meanwhile, new Israeli banking policies have also prevented the PA from depositing roughly $4.6 billion, creating a severe liquidity crisis that has compounded the already-dire economic situation. Unemployment in the West Bank has climbed to 35 percent, with more than 200,000 Palestinians losing their jobs inside Israel when the IDF revoked their entry permits due to security concerns following the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023. Mustafa said that Ramallah has managed to convince Arab and European countries to provide additional assistance to offset the lack of funds, but the PA is still piling up a massive deficit due to borrowing from the private sector. The PA premier then highlighted the IDF’s counter-terror operations throughout the West Bank that have forced tens of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in the midst of the economic crisis. Israel says such operations are a security necessity to combat entrenched terror networks and prevent numerous plots for deadly attacks every year. Those raids have taken place amid near-daily attacks by settlers on Palestinians that have gone largely unchecked. The Biden administration led Western countries in sanctioning extremist settler individuals and entities last year. But Trump had undone the policy, and Mustafa acknowledged that the sanctions had little effect on the ground. Nonetheless, he urged countries to take “more serious actions to give the right signal… to this Israeli government that this is not acceptable.” Asked about the reforms that he and the PA are undertaking, Mustafa acknowledged that Ramallah still has work to do, but he pointed to elections that Abbas has agreed to hold next year. Municipal elections will also be held in early 2026, the prime minister said. Abbas has announced plans for elections on multiple occasions in the past, but has repeatedly canceled them. He has blamed Israeli restrictions, but critics have pointed to fears that he and his widely unpopular Fatah party would suffer crushing defeats in any public vote. “Even if we are not the best performing administration in the world, we still have a responsibility toward our people, especially our people in Gaza,” Mustafa said. “What they need most today is assistance so that we can shelter them, send their kids back to schools, treat the injured people, start getting them new jobs… [and] rebuild Gaza.” He also noted that while many world leaders have called on the PA to reform, the term has become something of a buzzword that often goes unspecified. “While we are making every effort to [carry out] these reforms, we hope that this will not be used as an excuse for the Israeli government to continue its occupation,” Mustafa said. As for the PA’s ability to resume running Gaza after it was ousted by Hamas in 2007, Mustafa pointed out that Ramallah already has 35,000 employees in the Strip, including 6,000 teachers, 7,000 doctors and thousands of dormant security personnel, which could serve as the backbone for a police force necessary for stabilizing Gaza. Several thousand other PA employees are also being trained by Jordan and Egypt in order to be later deployed in Gaza, he said, adding that PA personnel have also been tasked with helping resume the management of the Rafah Border Crossing, once Israel agrees to reopen it. Mustafa said the PA is prepared to formally invite an international security force to help stabilize the Strip, as envisioned by Trump’s 20-point plan for ending the war. However, he stressed that the security force be mandated by the UN Security Council, work with and support existing PA forces, and also be a temporary solution. “I encourage everybody to help get the PA in the right place… not only to govern in the West Bank, but also in Gaza because this is the best way possible to get us out of the situation in [the Strip],” Mustafa continued. “No international mission alone can do it. The PA is a big asset for stability in the region.” Asked in closing how he views the recent decisions by several major Western countries to recognize a Palestinian state, Mustafa insisted that those moves were not merely symbolic. “I think this will help us restore hope that a two-state solution is still possible [by demonstrating that] there is still a strong international support for it,” he said. “It’s important to remind the Israeli government and the Israeli people that occupation is not the solution. There are still millions of Palestinians living next door, and they still demand their rights, regardless of time passing.” Support The Times of Israel's independent journalism and receive access to our documentary series, DocuNation: The Heart of Israel.

    "text": "Political figure Richard Ahiagbah has demanded immediate government action to revive Ghana’s stalled agricultural agenda. He contends that critical delays in the Feed Ghana program are depriving farmers and the national economy of promised benefits. Ahiagbah argued the initiative, designed to enhance food security and provide farmer support, has failed to show meaningful progress. He expressed particular concern over the absence of promised buffer stock systems and market access for local producers. These shortcomings especially impact local rice farmers grappling with post harvest losses, he noted. The situation reportedly undermines confidence in the administration’s flagship strategy and hinders the sector’s potential for job creation and expanded production. Ahiagbah challenged the government to reaffirm its commitment to import substitution. He specifically urged authorities to bolster domestic capacity for rice production. “It would be a feather in the president’s cap to promote our local capacity,” Ahiagbah stated, advocating for political will to support Ghanaian growers over import cartels. He further emphasized that locally produced rice offers superior nutritional value compared to imported alternatives. Consistent execution of agricultural reforms, he maintained, would conserve foreign exchange, stabilize the cedi, generate employment, and ensure sustainable sector growth.",

    "text": "Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox Traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, in New York City, on Oct 30. PHOTO: AFP Summary AI generated Published Nov 01, 2025, 05:13 AM Updated Nov 01, 2025, 05:13 AM NEW YORK - Wall Street’s main stock indexes closed higher on Oct 31, with their biggest boost coming from Amazon’s upbeat earnings forecast, but sentiment was dampened by worries that the Federal Reserve is becoming more cautious about cutting rates. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow boasted weekly gains and their longest monthly winning streaks in years. Amazon shares rallied sharply, closing up 9.6 per cent after hitting an all-time high following its forecast for quarterly sales above estimates. The online retailer and cloud services giant helped the consumer discretionary sector close up 4 per cent for its biggest one-day gain since May 12. But elsewhere in megacap companies, Apple’s shares closed down 0.4 per cent after its forecast for iPhone holiday quarter sales surpassed Wall Street expectations was clouded by chief executive officer Tim Cook’s flagging of supply constraints. And in remarks that cooled investor hopes for policy easing, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president Raphael Bostic said on Oct 31 that a December rate cut was not locked in despite market expectations for a cut. And Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Beth Hammack said she had opposed a rate cut on Oct 29 because inflation is too high. On Oct 31, traders were pricing in a 65 per cent probability of a December rate cut, down from 72.8 per cent on Oct 30 and 91.7 per cent a week ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. “The theme today is pretty similar to what we saw yesterday. It’s earnings coming in a little better than expected but tempered by a little more hawkish commentary from the Fed,” said Mr James Ragan, co-CIO and director of investment management research at D.A. Davidson. Mr Jake Seltz, portfolio manager for the Empiric LT Equity team at Allspring, said investors “may have gotten in front of their skis” in their bets for lower rates. Some grocery stocks traded lower on Oct 31 on worries about a dip in November sales if federal food aid benefits, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or Snap,  lapse in the ongoing government shutdown. Two federal judges ruled on Oct 31 that President Donald Trump’s administration cannot suspend food aid for millions of Americans during the shutdown, saying the government must use contingency funds to pay for the benefits. But shares of grocer Kroger ended down 2.8 per cent while food supplier Conagra Brands lost 1.3 per cent and Walmart ended down 1 per cent even after the rulings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 40.75 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 47,562.87, the S&P 500 gained 17.86 points, or 0.26 per cent, to 6,840.20 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 143.81 points, or 0.61 per cent, to 23,724.96. For the month, the S&P 500 added 2.27 per cent, for a sixth consecutive monthly gain, which was its longest such streak since August 2021. The Nasdaq Composite added 4.7 per cent for October, capping a seven-month winning streak, its longest since early 2018. The Dow rose 2.5 per cent for the month, for its sixth straight monthly gain and its longest monthly advance since January 2018. For the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent while the Nasdaq added 2.24 per cent and the Dow climbed 0.75 per cent. Of the 315 S&P 500 companies that have reported third-quarter results so far, 83.2 per cent have surpassed analysts’ estimates, according to LSEG data. That is well above the historical average, where roughly 67 per cent of firms beat forecasts. With a lack of economic data from the government due to the month-long shutdown, Ms Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital, said investors were keenly focused on earnings reports. “The government isn’t giving us the data that we have become dependent on, so we’re using companies as we should by the way for guidance about how the economy is going,” she said. In other moves, Warner Bros Discovery jumped 8.7 per cent following a Reuters report that Netflix was actively exploring a bid for the company’s studio and streaming business. Netflix rose 2.7 per cent after it unveiled plans for a 10-for-1 stock split. Western Digital closed up 8.7 per cent after rallying to an all-time high following its forecast of quarterly earnings above Wall Street estimates. Shares of Solar panel maker First Solar surged 14.3 per cent after surpassing expectations for third-quarter sales. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.28-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, where there were 159 new highs and 131 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 2,773 stocks rose and 1,958 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.42-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 34 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 159 new lows. On US exchanges, 21.03 billion shares changed hands compared with the 21.13 billion average for the last 20 sessions. REUTERS",

    "title": "West Africa Takes Digital Leap With SIGMAT Customs Launch",
    "text": "The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is officially launching a homegrown digital customs platform that could fundamentally transform how goods move across the region’s borders, as technical experts from Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Liberia convene in Monrovia this week to finalize preparations for rolling out the Interconnected System for the Management of Goods in Transit. The two day meeting, taking place October 30 through 31 in the Liberian capital, brings together senior customs officials and ICT specialists to review operational guidelines and technical protocols before Friday’s official launch ceremony. SIGMAT, as the platform is known, represents years of planning to create a real time digital network enabling customs authorities across ECOWAS member states to exchange transit data electronically, track cargo movements, and process clearances with minimal paperwork. The system is designed to make cross border trade faster, safer, and more transparent, with officials saying the platform will help tackle smuggling and documentation fraud while ensuring more efficient coordination among customs agencies along regional trade corridors. For a region where trucks can sit at borders for days awaiting clearance while goods spoil and costs mount, the potential impact looks substantial. What makes SIGMAT particularly significant is its homegrown nature. Rather than importing expensive foreign solutions that might not fit West African realities, ECOWAS developed this platform specifically for the region’s needs and challenges. As of May 2025, nine ECOWAS member states had already installed SIGMAT in their customs IT systems, with only Guinea Bissau and Cabo Verde yet to implement, demonstrating momentum building toward broader regional adoption. The initial rollout among Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Liberia creates a strategic corridor linking coastal and landlocked nations, addressing one of West Africa’s most persistent trade challenges. Landlocked countries like Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger depend entirely on coastal neighbors for access to international markets, making efficient transit systems crucial for their economic survival. When transit goods get stuck at borders or disappear through diversion, these landlocked nations suffer disproportionately. Friday’s launch ceremony will be attended by the Heads of Customs Administrations from the three participating countries, representatives of the ECOWAS Commission, and key development partners including the German International Cooperation Agency, which has supported SIGMAT’s development. This multi stakeholder approach reflects recognition that transforming regional trade requires coordination across governments, technical agencies, and international supporters. The platform operates as a centralized digital hub connecting customs administrations across member states. Importers, exporters, and customs agents submit declarations electronically through the SIGMAT portal, which then standardizes documentation across ECOWAS countries, reducing discrepancies and ensuring compliance with regional trade agreements. The system allows customs officials in different countries to access shared data instantly, eliminating redundant paperwork that has historically slowed border crossings. For goods in transit, SIGMAT provides end to end visibility by issuing electronic transit documents tracked in real time as cargo moves across borders. This ensures duties and taxes are properly managed while reducing risks of smuggling and revenue leakage that have plagued West African trade corridors for decades. A shipment moving from Abidjan to Monrovia, for instance, would be monitored digitally with automated alerts for any deviations from approved routes. The system’s benefits extend beyond just faster processing. By reducing clearance times by up to 40% and minimizing physical inspections, SIGMAT can lower costs for businesses through reduced demurrage and storage charges that have long plagued ports due to delays. For traders operating on thin margins, these savings could mean the difference between profit and loss on shipments. Revenue protection represents another crucial advantage. West African governments lose millions annually to customs fraud, cargo diversion, and underdeclaration of goods values. When paper based systems dominate and different countries can’t communicate electronically, tracking goods becomes nearly impossible once they leave the first border. SIGMAT’s real time monitoring makes it far harder for unscrupulous traders to game the system. The platform builds on earlier pilot programs that demonstrated viability. Nigeria and Benin Republic launched SIGMAT connectivity in May 2025 at the Seme Krake border, a critical junction on the Abidjan Lagos corridor that handles massive trade volumes. That pilot showed the technical feasibility of connecting different national customs systems and highlighted both successes and challenges that informed subsequent rollouts. Nigeria’s Comptroller General of Customs noted at that May launch that the concept was conceived over a decade ago, designed to improve goods visibility in transit, combat diversion and fraud along trade corridors, foster inter agency coordination, and reduce trade delays. The long development timeline reflects both the technical complexity and the political will required to align different national interests around common regional standards. Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, and Niger successfully implemented SIGMAT interconnections earlier, providing proof of concept that the system works when properly deployed. Those landlocked Sahelian nations have particular incentive to make transit systems efficient given their complete dependence on coastal access. Their experiences offer valuable lessons for this week’s Monrovia launch. However, SIGMAT faces real implementation challenges. Many West African countries struggle with unreliable electricity, poor digital infrastructure, and inconsistent internet access. A digital customs platform only works as well as the underlying connectivity supporting it. If power fails or internet drops at critical border points, the entire system risks grinding to halt, potentially creating worse bottlenecks than the paper systems it replaces. Political will represents another variable. Customs policies vary significantly across ECOWAS member states, reflecting different national interests, economic priorities, and revenue needs. Some countries depend heavily on customs revenue and may resist transparency that could reduce collections in the short term, even if regional integration benefits everyone long term. Getting fifteen countries to implement common standards and maintain consistent enforcement requires sustained political commitment. There’s also the human factor. The most sophisticated digital system proves useless if border agents, customs officers, and traders don’t understand, trust, or use it properly. Training programs must reach thousands of personnel across multiple countries, explaining not just how SIGMAT works technically but why it serves everyone’s interests. Resistance from officials comfortable with existing systems, or who benefit from current inefficiencies, could quietly undermine implementation. For Liberia specifically, hosting this launch carries symbolic importance. The country has worked hard rebuilding its institutions and economy following years of civil conflict, and serving as the venue for significant regional initiatives demonstrates its reintegration into West African leadership. Successfully implementing SIGMAT could help Liberia strengthen its position as a reliable trade partner and transit hub. The timing also matters for regional integration efforts more broadly. ECOWAS continues pursuing its vision for an integrated West African economy with free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. Plans for a common currency, the ECO, target 2027 launch despite delays and challenges. SIGMAT represents tangible progress on integration that affects real traders and real goods today, building confidence that broader regional projects can succeed. Trade facilitation through digital systems aligns with global trends as well. Countries worldwide are digitizing customs operations through platforms like UNCTAD’s ASYCUDA system, which twelve ECOWAS members already use as their national customs software. SIGMAT’s ability to integrate with ASYCUDA creates technical foundations for sustainable expansion as more countries join. The broader economic implications could prove substantial. Faster, cheaper, more reliable cross border trade enables businesses to plan better, invest more confidently, and access larger markets. Small and medium enterprises particularly benefit when trade barriers fall, since they lack the resources that larger firms use to navigate complex customs procedures. If SIGMAT delivers promised improvements, it could unleash entrepreneurial energy across the region. For development partners supporting SIGMAT, the platform represents exactly the kind of regional public good worth investing in. Unlike projects benefiting single countries, SIGMAT creates network effects where value increases as more members join. German cooperation through GIZ reflects European interest in stable, prosperous West Africa as migration pressures and security concerns make regional development a strategic priority. Friday’s launch won’t solve all West African trade challenges instantly. Corruption, poor infrastructure, inconsistent regulations, and weak institutions will continue constraining commerce regardless of how well SIGMAT functions technically. But the platform addresses genuine problems in ways that create measurable improvements for stakeholders across the trade ecosystem. As customs chiefs and technical experts finalize preparations this week, they’re working on something that transcends routine government technology projects. SIGMAT embodies a vision where West African borders become connectors rather than barriers, where goods flow efficiently supporting economic growth, and where regional integration moves from aspiration toward reality one digital connection at a time. Whether SIGMAT fulfills its promise depends on sustained commitment across multiple countries over years of implementation. The Monrovia launch represents an important milestone, but true success will be measured by how many trucks cross borders faster, how much revenue governments collect more efficiently, and how many businesses thrive thanks to reduced trade friction across this dynamic but fragmented region.",

    "title": "We were never meant to be anonymous",
    "text": "I was born in Bangkok, Thailand — a metropolis of over 11 million people — and studied in Boston and Chicago. Today, I call Harmony, Minnesota home — a town along the Root River with a population boasting just over 1,000 people. Despite my affection for small town living, I still think of my urban upbringing fondly, and still salivate thinking of my favorite ramen restaurant in Chicago. Yet, in the midst of so many options of where to eat, who to befriend, where to spend my time, I also know that most of my city experiences included sitting in a crowded train, head down, with my face buried in my phone and clueless to the people around me. I was often more of a consumer of community, rather than a creator. I could go through a whole day and be completely anonymous. And while periods of anonymity can help you explore new parts of yourself, ultimately I don’t believe humans are meant to live anonymous lives. In an age of digital connection and hyper mobility, it’s easy to forget the quiet power of being known. Not just recognized, but truly known — by name, by story, by contribution. The poet Wendell Berry once wrote, “A community is the mental and spiritual condition of knowing that the place is shared, and that the people who share the place define and limit the possibilities of each other's lives.” That’s not just poetic — it’s a blueprint for vitality. Here in southern Minnesota, we see this truth play out every day. Our small towns are not just dots on a map; they are ecosystems of relationship. The barista who remembers your order, the neighbor who plows your driveway without asking, the school board member who provides in-home child care to your new infant — these are not coincidences. They are the fabric of a life that resists anonymity. At Southern Minnesota Initiative Foundation, we invest in this fabric. We believe that economic development is inseparable from human development. That thriving communities are built not just on infrastructure, but on trust. And that the vitality of a place depends on the visibility of its people. Just this month, we approved 23 Small Town Grants totaling $200,000 to support projects focused on creating a sense of belonging for all and are in the process of approving Taylor Rural Improvements Grant applications that can make a big impact on the vibrancy of small towns. When I tell you about why I love Harmony, it’s not just that we have four restaurants, a distillery and a grocery store all along our downtown drag — but that I can tell you about the chef who comes out of the kitchen to sing Pink Pony Club with his five-year-old daughter at open mic night, or the couple who moved from New Mexico to open a maker space for the community because they fell in love with a run-down building that they believed they could bring back to life. Our community knows their stories, and they show up to wrap their support around them. To us, it’s not just the end product but the process and people it takes to get there. Similarly, when SMIF supports early childhood programs, we’re not just preparing kids for school — we’re anchoring families in a shared future. When we fund local entrepreneurs, we’re not just boosting the economy — we’re affirming that dreams belong here. And when we partner with towns to support community initiatives, we’re not just contributing resources — we’re contributing to a sense of belonging. Berry’s words remind us that community is not a luxury — it’s a necessity. Humans were never meant to live anonymous lives. We are meant to be accountable, celebrated, challenged and cherished. That’s what small towns offer, both to long-time residents and the newcomers from across the state, country or from across the world, who help our small towns remain vital. And that’s why we must continue to invest in them — not just with dollars, but with belief. Before my predecessor retired, he launched the Tim Penny Small Towns endowment fund to establish a long-term investment vehicle dedicated to that very belief. Today, I get the honor of continuing to grow our Small Town Fund and invite those of you reading to join me. Because in the end, vitality isn’t measured by population size. It’s measured by the strength of connection. And in southern Minnesota, connection is our greatest resource. As always, I welcome your comments and questions. You can reach me at benyak@smifoundation.org or 507-455-3215.",

    "title": "'Why did he promise it?': Poilievre criticizes Carney for not securing U.S. trade deal",
    "text": "Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is questioning why Prime Minister Mark Carney promised he could handle U.S. President Donald Trump, given that the two countries have yet to finalize a trade agreement that would see Canada granted some tariff relief. Speaking to CBC’s Rosemary Barton Live, Poilievre said Carney has not delivered on what he promised during the spring election campaign. “Mr. Carney promised a good deal by July 21. He promised he could negotiate a win with President Trump. Those were his promises,” he told host Rosemary Barton. “Some might say, ‘Look, it’s unrealistic to expect to get that from President Trump.’ So why did he promise it? It wasn't just that it was a promise. It was the promise.” Carney’s key message during the spring election campaign was centred around dealing with the U.S. administration. Negotiators were working toward a potential deal on tariffs until Trump abruptly called off trade talks in a late-night social media post last week. The president said his decision was due to an advertisement by the Ontario government that uses former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's own words to send an anti-tariff message to American audiences. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said Carney apologized for the ad, which was pulled off the air on Monday — but not before it was played over the weekend, including on American networks during the World Series. “I have a very good relationship [with Carney]. I like him a lot, but what they did was wrong. He was very nice. He apologized for what they did with the commercial,” Trump said on Friday in a scrum with reporters on Air Force One. The Prime Minister's Office has not confirmed whether Carney personally apologized for the ad. Trump also said he has no plans to resume trade talks with Canada. When asked how he would handle the relationship with Trump, Poilievre argued boosting the economy would put Canada in a position of strength and rang off some of his promises to get major projects built. But he suggested that speculating if his approach would work better than Carney’s isn’t helpful at the moment because he isn’t prime minister. “What we do know is that Mr. Carney is prime minister — has been for seven months — and these are the results that he's got,” he said. “His failures abroad are costing us at home.” The full interview with Poilievre will air on Rosemary Barton Live, Sunday at 10 a.m. ET.",

    "title": "Cuomo courts Sliwa voters in Russian NYC neighborhood — warning against danger of socialist Zohran Mamdani",
    "text": "Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo made an appeal to Republican voters in Brooklyn’s Russian-speaking enclave Friday — warning them a vote for GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa will only help socialist Zohran Mamdani get elected. The independent mayoral candidate positioned himself as the only viable option to beat the front-runner Democratic nominee, campaigning alongside firebrand Republican Councilwoman Inna Vernikov in Brighton Beach. “There is no way Curtis Sliwa can actually win. Curtis Sliwa can only make Zohran Mamdani win,” Cuomo said, recalling President Trump’s brutal prognosis of the Guardian Angels founder’s chances in the Nov. 4 election. “Don’t believe me. Believe President Trump if you’re a Republican” Cuomo told voters at the Ocean View Cafe, a Ukrainian restaurant on Brighton Beach Avenue. “President Trump said Curtis Sliwa is not ready for prime time.” Vernikov, a staunch Republican who nonetheless endorsed Cuomo over her party’s nominee this week, recalled the local community is largely made up of “families who escaped the former Soviet Union.” “They escaped communism and socialism. A lot of people here are Jewish immigrants. They escaped antisemitism,” she said. “We came to America for the American dream, for capitalism, for the free market economy, for opportunities for our children. “And what we’re seeing now is everything that we escaped, communism, socialism, antisemitism is coming back into New York City.” The local councilwoman, for the 48th District, previously supported Sliwa for mayor — but changed her tune to back Cuomo after seeing polling results showing the veteran Democrat had a better chance of beating socialist Mamdani. “Curtis Sliwa cannot be mayor because he is not winning … the only one who can beat Mamdani is Governor Andrew Cuomo,” she said, referring to recent polls that show Cuomo between 10 to 25 points behind Mamdani and Sliwa lagging by 25 to 29 points. The councilwoman — who was arrested in 2023 for wielding a firearm at a pro-Palestinian rally — referred to Mamdani as a “communist and an antisemitic” to her constituents. Mamdani, who identifies as a democratic socialist, last week held a press conference slamming the rhetoric spewed by his opponents as Islamophobic — which Cuomo and Sliwa have denied. Daniel Kurzyna, a spokesperson for Sliwa, said the concerted effort from Vernikov and Cuomo to siphon the GOP standard-bearer’s voters was “not needle-moving whatsoever.” “Curtis will shock the world,” he said. A rep for Mamdani did not respond to the Post’s request for comment.",

    "text": "NORTH VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 31, 2025 /CNW/ - Solving Canada's housing crisis requires immediate action to build up supply and bring down costs. The Government of Canada is stepping up with unprecedented investments to supercharge housing construction in Canada.  To that end, the federal government launched Build Canada Homes, a new federal agency that will build affordable housing at scale, including transitional and supportive housing, deeply affordable and community housing, and affordable homes for the Canadian middle class. As we build a strong Canadian housing sector, purposeful collaboration will be essential. That means working together with the private and non-profit sectors to bring down costs and build homes at a scale and pace not seen in generations. These investments are also providing Canadians with increased access to affordable and sustainable housing. The Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) provides funding through low-interest and/or forgivable loans or contributions to partnered organizations for new affordable housing and the renovation and repair of existing, affordable and community housing. Today, the Honourable Gregor Robertson, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure and Minister responsible for Pacific Economic Development Canada was joined by the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Member of Parliament for North Vancouver – Capilano, and Linda Buchanan, Mayor of the City of North Vancouver  toured the first phase of an ambitious affordable housing project at 144 St Georges Avenue, which is nearing completion and which received support from the federal government.  The second phase of this project is receiving $84.5 million in funding to help build 179 secure, affordable rental homes at 120 St Georges Avenue. They also This is an example of the Government of Canada's commitment to investing in affordable housing right across the country The 18-storey, mass timber building will provide housing for singles, couples, families, and seniors in North Vancouver. The rental homes will range in size from studio to three-bedroom units. This is the second phase of the North Shore Neighbourhood House Hub Redevelopment, which is a multi-partner project on City-owned land that supports the City's ongoing commitment to increasing rental housing and community-based services. When all three phases are completed, it will provide rental housing, a new North Shore Neighbourhood House (NSNH), a respite centre with 18 overnight beds and 25 adult daycare spaces, and a redesigned Derek Inman Park. Budget 2025, to be tabled next week, will build on this momentum with further measures to lower costs for builders, catalyse private capital, and work towards doubling the pace of homebuilding across Canada. Budget 2025 will spend less on government operations and reduce waste, so we can invest more to grow our economy, build more homes, and make life more affordable for you. Quotes: \"We need to build more, build better and build bolder. Through investments in rental housing, our government is supporting those who need it most, here in North Vancouver and across the country. We are committed to strengthening communities through initiatives like this one.\" — The Honourable Gregor Robertson, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure and Minister responsible for Pacific Economic Development Canada \"The Government of Canada is committed to increasing housing supply to enable enhanced affordability. I have been watching progress on what will be an 18-storey mass timber building – the new home to our beloved community services provider, the North Shore Neighbourhood House. Its 179 rental homes, from studios to three-bedroom units, will be a step forward for housing in North Vancouver – which is a real issue for many who live here. . It's an example of what's possible when all levels of government and the private sector work together. It's also another step forward in our ambitious plan to build Canada strong.\" — The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Member of Parliament for North Vancouver—Capilano \"The development at 120 St. Georges Avenue is a great example of how BC Builds is transforming housing delivery in our province. With federal support, we're bringing 179 new rental homes and a revitalized North Shore Neighbourhood House to life as quickly as possible. This project shows what's possible when we work together to build vibrant, inclusive communities.\" — The Honourable Christine Boyle, BC Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs \"We welcome the federal government's contribution to our BC Builds project at 120 St. Georges Ave. Better known as Phase 2 of the North Shore Neighbourhood House Redevelopment Project, this investment means real homes for people in North Vancouver. It means child care spaces, wellness programs, and a renewed a community hub that reflects the heart of the community.\"— The Honourable Bowinn Ma, MLA for North Vancouver-Lonsdale \"As housing costs continue to rise, it's become increasingly difficult for people to live close to where they work,\" said Linda Buchanan, Mayor of the City of North Vancouver. \"This vital new funding from the Government of Canada is an investment in our shared commitment to building affordable, inclusive communities. The Hub Redevelopment offers a transformative solution—delivering affordable homes, strengthening essential services, and ensuring a vibrant, thriving community for generations to come.\" — Linda Buchanan, Mayor, City of North Vancouver \"Catalyst Community Developments Society is grateful to the Government of Canada for making this investment in homes for people in North Vancouver possible. This project shows how strong federal leadership and committed local partners can deliver affordable homes close to where people live and work. At Catalyst, we're ready to do more—in partnership with the Federal Government—to accelerate housing solutions that help more people and strengthen more communities.

    "title": "COP 30: Tinubu Okays National Carbon Market Framework, Climate Fund",
    "text": "Ahead of the 30th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 30) in Brazil, President Bola Tinubu has approved the adoption of a National Carbon Market Framework, the operationalisation of the Climate Change Fund and the restoration of the National Council on Climate Change (NCCC) to the budget line. The goal was to establish and manage Nigeria’s participation in carbon markets, enabling the nation to unlock between $2.5billion and $3billion annually in carbon finance over the next decade to help meet climate goals. The approvals followed a presentation by the Director General of NCCC, Mrs Omotenioye Majekodunmi, at the second meeting of the Council held on Thursday evening at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. President Tinubu, who was represented by Vice President Kashim Shettima, said the approvals were part of measures by his administration to properly position Nigeria to leverage opportunities in the global carbon market and be more active in climate change ecosystem. According to a statement by presidential spokesman, Stanley Nkwocha, the Nigerian leader also set the agenda for Nigeria ahead of the forthcoming COP 30 scheduled for Belem, Brazil, saying the focus was to harness all of the opportunities for financing climate resilient projects and related interventions, particularly from the global carbon market. The President said his administration recognised the fact that addressing climate change was not just an environment imperative but an opportunity to unlock new investments, jobs and innovations across the nation’s energy, agriculture and industrial sectors. He said, “Nigeria stands ready to takes its rightful place as a global leader in climate action, ensuring that our voice and our reality are heard and respected in international negotiations. “We have demonstrated this commitment through our active participation in the UNFCCC process, our progress towards implementing our nationally determined contributions and our efforts to mobilize climate finance for adaption and mitigation across all levels of government.” The President assured that as chairman of the Council, climate action will continue to be prioritised in his administration’s development agenda. “We will continue to champion policies that protect our people, strengthen our economy and position Nigeria as a destination for green investment and innovation,” he added. Earlier, the Director-General of the National Council on Climate Change and Secretary to the Council, Mrs. Omotenioye Majekodunmi, informed the council chaired by Vice President Shettima, who represented President Tinubu, that the meeting was timely ahead of the 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 30) scheduled to hold in Brazil. She said the deliberations and decisions of the council would shape how Nigeria is perceived globally and determine how effectively the country can mobilize support to achieve its climate goals. The Council Secretariat expressed its commitment to providing the technical leadership and coordination needed to translate Nigeria’s climate goals into measurable results. Presenting the Council’s progress report, Majekodunmi disclosed that Nigeria is now eligible to access new rounds of climate finance from multilateral funds. Highlighting the Secretariat’s key requests, she said the Council sought the adoption of the National Carbon Market Framework to enable Nigeria unlock between $2.5 billion and $3 billion annually in carbon finance over the next decade. The Council also requested the operationaliszation of the Climate Change Fund to ensure immediate readiness for fund mobilisation and utilisation. The final request was for the Council to restore the NCCC budget line within the annual FAAC allocation to guarantee the financial stability of the Climate Change Fund. The Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, backed the Council Secretariat’s recommendations, noting that Nigeria must secure a strong position within the carbon framework. He assured the Council of the Finance Ministry’s support, including coordination with the ministry’s economic department to host a quarterly Climate Finance Tracking Dashboard.",

    "title": "Top Democrat presses Trump administration on Argentina 'bailout' during shutdown",
    "text": "Rep. Jamie Raskin demands transparency from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the Trump administration's $40 billion Argentina deal. FIRST ON FOX: The top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee is demanding increased transparency from the Trump administration on the factors that led it to make its multibillion-dollar gamble on Argentina. In a letter sent Friday to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Robert Citrone, the manager of Discovery Capital Management LLC, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., requested details about their relationship after the Trump administration's announcement of the deal earlier this month. Raskin, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, asked to see any correspondence between Bessent and Citrone on Argentina, the investment and Citrone’s holdings in the country. \"It is imperative that the American people have a full understanding of why, in the midst of a government shutdown, this administration has chosen to orchestrate a $40 billion bailout to Argentina. What specific arrangements were made to accomplish this astounding result?\" Raskin wrote. TRUMP, DEMOCRATS LOCKED IN ENDLESS CYCLES OF PAYBACK AFTER COMEY INDICTMENT AND TARGETING PRESIDENT'S ENEMIES Citrone did not respond to several requests for comment. Russell Dye, a spokesperson for the Republican Judiciary Committee, said the letter represented just the most recent example of Democrats' fixation on critiquing the administration’s decisions. \"Democrats should focus on opening the government and paying federal workers, many of whom live in ranking member Raskin’s district, rather than obsessing over President Trump. But, sadly, their priority will always be attacking President Trump instead of paying the troops, air traffic controllers and families who are hurting,\" Dye said. FOX NEWS POLITICS NEWSLETTER: CORNYN'S 'CROOKED POLITICIANS' CRACKDOWN The Trump administration announced that it facilitated $20 billion in private financing for Argentina alongside a $20 billion currency swap, providing a financial backstop for a country that has struggled for years to find its footing amid high inflation. The investment aims to help Argentina manage its debts as the value of its currency, the Argentine peso, continues to fluctuate. The decision to direct American dollars toward Argentina raised accusations from Democrats that the investment carried political undertones meant to benefit Argentine President Javier Milei, a figure closely aligned with the Trump administration. Like Trump, Milei entered office in 2023 with promises to shrink the government’s footprint and bring down the country’s costs. But more than just the political undercurrents, Democrats like Raskin argue that some figures close to the administration — like Citrone — may receive collateral benefits as a result. \"In October 2024, you said that ‘the probability of default in Argentina is minuscule.’ Yet, in the past couple of months, a run on the Argentinian peso has put the country’s economy — and your hedge fund’s massive investments — on the brink of collapse. Suddenly, President Trump and Secretary Bessent announced the United States would take ‘exceptional measures’ to stabilize Argentina’s markets. The total amount of assistance for Argentina is a whopping $40 billion,\" Raskin wrote. Citrone and Bessent previously worked together for George Soros in 2013, according to statements Citrone made in a Goldman Sachs podcast. According to the reporting from the Securities and Exchange Commission , Discovery Capital’s exposure to Argentina is high, but not as high as it used to be. Discovery’s investments with companies based in or conducting business in Argentina have scaled down since December 2024. The fund’s investments in 2025 are tens of millions of dollars below levels from a year before. Citrone’s exposure in connection with Argentina is still north of $100 million, according to the SEC. RUBIO BLASTS 'DISHONEST' DEMOCRATS FOR TYING HIM TO 'FAKE' TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS In addition to demanding more information about Bessent's thinking on Argentina, Raskin blasted the decision to invest in Argentina during an ongoing, 31-day government shutdown. \"The Republican government shutdown has deprived millions of federal workers — including law enforcement and air traffic controllers — of their paychecks and is threatening government programs vital to the American people. But, in the midst of this government-created crisis, the Trump administration has chosen to arrange a $40 billion bailout to Argentina — half of it funded with taxpayer money,\" Raskin wrote.

    "title": "The British government ‘must recognise hydrogen’, says Hyundai",
    "text": "Q: There’s a well-worn joke in motoring circles that hydrogen fuel-cell cars are ten years from becoming mainstream … and have been since the 1960s. That’s when General Motors introduced its first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle concept. But as Hyundai launches a new and improved version of its hydrogen car, the company’s UK president is urging the British government to recognise the technology as a key part of a “global hydrogen economy”. Not doing so could risk the UK being left behind. According to data from H2stations.org, at the end of 2024 there were 748 hydrogen refuelling stations in operation across Asia — China being the global leader with 384 locations across the country. Hyundai’s native South Korea is second, with 198 stations, and almost every service area along its motorway network now includes hydrogen refuelling. Europe is also investing in its hydrogen refuelling network, with 294 locations in operation across the Continent by the end of last year. Of these, 113 were in Germany, with 65 in France, 25 in the Netherlands and 19 in Switzerland. But the UK passenger car refuelling network is lagging behind, and the number of places to top up a hydrogen tank has gone into reverse in recent years. In 2019 there were ten publicly accessible H₂ filling stations in the UK, but today the figure stands at two: one at Heathrow (Hatton Cross) and the other in Tyseley, Birmingham. Two hydrogen fuel cell cars are on sale in the UK: the Toyota Mirai and the Hyundai Nexo. Hyundai says it has sold 40,000 Nexo cars worldwide, with its domestic market having the most sales. However, it is believed fewer than 20 have been registered in the UK since it was put on sale here in 2019, with most used as demonstration vehicles by companies with an interest in developing the hydrogen economy. The focus in the UK is shifting towards the operation of buses and commercial vehicles that support the demand for the growth of hydrogen, with existing and planned hydrogen hubs for these vehicles scattered around the country, including in Aberdeen, Dundee, the Tees Valley, Merseyside, Suffolk and south Wales. This follows more than £2 billion in government funding for 11 projects, including Whitelee Green Hydrogen in Scotland, one of whose customers will be the InchDairnie distillery in Fife, which is aiming to distil its whisky sustainably by 2027. The initial Hydrogen Allocation Rounds funding has also gone towards the Bradford Low Carbon project, which will use renewable electricity to power a 24.5mW alkaline electrolyser to supply clean hydrogen to the likes of JCB, and Wrightbus, which developed the world’s first hydrogen-powered double-decker bus. Twenty-seven projects were selected earlier this year for the second round of funding, known as HAR2, which includes £400 million of private sector investment. These could use hydrogen to decarbonise their manufacturing and industrial processes, including ammonia production, new clean power generation, glass manufacturing, brick-making, and sustainable aviation fuel production. Hyundai is banking on this commercial hydrogen economy growth alongside that of passenger cars. “Hydrogen will become a key pillar of the global clean energy ecosystem — not only in mobility, but also in energy and industry,” said Ashley Andrew, the UK president of Hyundai and its sister brand Genesis. “Hyundai views hydrogen as essential to achieving carbon neutrality, especially in sectors that are hard to fully electrify, such as commercial transport, logistics and industrial applications. “We expect hydrogen to expand beyond passenger vehicles into commercial vehicles, trains, maritime and even future home and industrial energy systems.” This week, Hyundai broke ground on a new hydrogen fuel cell production facility in Ulsan, South Korea, following an investment of nearly £500 million. The 43,000 sq m facility, which is set for completion in 2027, will mass-produce 30,000 fuel cell units annually. It will also include advanced polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysers. These split hydrogen from oxygen in water molecules, and the gas can then be compressed and stored in tanks. It’s the recombining of hydrogen with oxygen from the air in a fuel cell that generates electrical energy, with water being the by-product. PEMs run on renewable energy, such as solar, and transportation in zero-emission vehicles results in a green power ecosystem. When created via fossil fuels the resulting gas is known as grey, brown or black hydrogen, as the process is not genuinely clean. The Ulsan ground-breaking ceremony also involved hydrogen-powered vehicles, including lorries, excavators, boats, tractors and forklifts. “Hydrogen accelerates carbon neutrality by addressing the intermittency of renewables and enhancing energy resilience,” said Jaehoon Chang, the vice-chairman of Hyundai Motor Group. “Hydrogen also stands out as a strategic energy carrier, enabling localised generation and distribution systems — such as off-grid and micro-grid ecosystems — which reduce reliance on centralised grids and strengthen communities’ self-sufficiency.” Hyundai’s investment in the technology includes advances in efficiency for the new Nexo, with the fuel cell output up 11 per cent, battery output up 100 per cent and the electric motor output up 33 per cent compared with the previous-generation Nexo. Combined with aerodynamic improvements, its range on a single charge of hydrogen has increased from 414 miles to 513 miles, and the Nexo now has a towing capacity of up to 1,000kg (the previous model was not rated for towing at all). It takes about five minutes to refuel completely. The company is developing its hydrogen passenger cars alongside its hybrids and battery electric vehicles (Bevs), such as the Ioniq 5, the Ioniq 6 and the Kona Electric. Hyundai Motor Group also sells Bevs under the Kia and Genesis brands. The firm expects the two technologies to continue to coexist. “Bevs may be more suitable for short-distance applications without the need for quick charging, while FCEVs, with their exceptional energy density and rapid-refuelling capabilities, will conquer long and medium-haul trucking,” Andrew said. “The hydrogen industry remains in a growth phase and will continue to advance through close collaboration between industry and government, as public-private partnerships are key to expanding infrastructure. “To meet zero-emission vehicle mandates and accelerate fleet decarbonisation, government must recognise hydrogen as a strategic enabler, and maintain openness to all viable technologies that support medium to long-term climate goals.” CAR CLINIC October 23 2025, 1.20pm Tim Shallcross October 16 2025, 6.00pm Adam Hay-Nicholls car clinic October 07 2025, 8.00pm Tim Shallcross October 31 2025, 11.00pm David Green November 01 2025, 4.00am Anna Murphy, Fashion Director October 31 2025, 11.00pm Anna Murphy",

    "title": "Republican Matt Van Epps touts strong support of Trump in Tennessee special congressional election",
    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — Republican nominee for US Congress Matt Van Epps touted his military service and endorsement from President Donald Trump in his primary victory and believes those factors will help him beat his Democratic opponent in the special congressional election. Van Epps is a West Point graduate who flew helicopter combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. He beat out a crowded Republican field with nearly 52% of the total Republican vote. Van Epps faces Aftyn Behn, the democratic nominee, are going head to head in a special election to fill the congressional seat vacated after republican Mark Green abruptly retired over the summer. On Inside Politics, Van Epps said President Trump's popularity remains strong across the seventh congressional district, which includes 14 counties and many rural areas that are home to soybean farmers, who right now, are being hit hard by tariffs. \"Soybean farmers, row crop farmers are struggling,\" Van Epps acknowledged. But added that he supports the President's use of tariffs. \"The president, who is the best negotiator in the world, is working to ensure we stop getting ripped off and that we have fair trade and I think in the long-term we are going to see benefits from that,\" Van Epps said. He's such a strong supporter of President Trump, that he did not rule out him serving a third term, despite the the Constitution limiting US presidents to a total of two terms. He was asked if he believes the Constitution applies to President Trump. \"The Constitution applies to everybody, but there are very deliberate processes for amending the Constitution and a pathway there, and those were built in by the founders, the framers,\" Van Epps said. His opponent, State Rep. Aftyn Behn, (D-Nashville), said a key difference between the two, is she would immediately call for full disclosure of convicted sex trafficker Jeffry Epstein's files. Van Epps said he supports the approach favored by the House Speaker and President Trump, who has told supporters there is nothing to see there. He was asked, \"The files are there, why not just release them?\" Van Epps responded, \"They are taking a deliberative approach with subpoena power so they can fully investigate the situation and hold those accountable that need to be held accountable for the heinous crimes that happened.\" Behn said on Inside Politics last week that affordability and reversing the cuts from the \"Big Ugly Bill\" would be her focus. \"If you think things are going well, I am not your candidate. If you are upset with the cost of living and the chaos of our federal and state government, then I am your candidate,\" she said. Van Epps called Behn a \"socialist\" but said he would also focus on the economy. \"I think we are moving in a great direction, but we've got work to do. The cost of living is too high; inflation is still too high. The Republicans have advanced very sensible good solutions,\" Van Epps said. He said his first bill as a congressman, if we wins, would focus on helping veterans. The full interview with Matt Van Epps airs on Inside Politics, Friday at 7pm on NewsChannel 5 Plus and throughout the weekend. It is also available as a podcast, just enter \"Inside Politics Nashville\" and start listening. You can also listen to the entire interview with democrat Aftyn Behn from last week. Early voting starts in less than two weeks on November 12. Election day is December 2, which is the week after Thanksgiving.

    "text": "The University of Southern California began cutting 259 jobs on Friday as it tackles a rising operating deficit of more than $230 million Since July 9, USC has laid off — or is in the process of terminating — 975 people throughout the university system’s nearly 24,600 faculty and staff. That tally doesn’t include 9,185 student workers. The university is “reducing and reorganizing its workforce due to cutbacks in funding and necessary budget reductions,” wrote Melissa Gerdes-Leonard, associate vice president of client services with USC’s human resources department, in an Oct. 27 letter filed with the state’s Employment Development Department. Also see: USC won’t sign Trump compact on federal funding The latest round of layoffs are happening at USC’s University Park, a leafy 229-acre main campus for the institution’s academic schools and residential buildings near Exposition Park in downtown Los Angeles. After the cuts are completed Dec. 31, USC will have shed 616 people on its main campus, or two-thirds of the workforce laid off to date. Some of the positions cut include a marketing director, procurement specialist, research administrator, office managers, library supervisor, event and facilities managers and instructional lab technicians. Gerdes-Leonard couldn’t be reached for comment, but USC spokesman Paul McQuiston confirmed the layoffs were coming as a result of the operating deficit and girding for cuts in federal funding. An update on the budget situation is expected next week. In a July 14 letter to faculty and staff, Interim President Byung-soo Kim announced spending cuts amid reductions to the university’s federal funding and inefficiencies to USC’s operating model. Kim reported the university lost more than $200 million in the 2025 fiscal year ending June 30, an increase from a $158 million deficit in 2024. Andrew Guzman, provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs, said at an Academic Senate meeting on Sept. 17 that USC had a projected structural deficit of $230 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. He outlined a plan of “personnel actions” and budget cuts to save $400 million through the end of the current fiscal year. Since the release of Kim’s letter in July, the scale of the layoffs has grown. The Viterbi School of Engineering laid off 55 professors, academic program directors, adjunct and clinical instructors and student services advisers, while the USC Health Sciences Campus laid off 151 — including several at the Keck School of Medicine, which includes a teaching hospital, specialized cancer hospital, community hospitals, and outpatient clinics throughout Southern California, and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. Other layoffs have happened at the Soto Street Building II, an academic and administrative building on the Health Sciences Campus in the Boyle Heights area northeast of downtown Los Angeles along Zonal Avenue, and a clinic on Flower Street and other Health Sciences buildings along San Pablo Street.",

The facility showcases over 50,000 artifacts, including the complete collection of King Tutankhamun's treasures.

    "text": "CAIRO (AP) — Egypt is inaugurating on Saturday the Grand Egyptian Museum, two decades in the making, with the aim of drawing more visitors to revitalize the country's tourist industry. Located just outside Cairo on the Giza Plateau which also includes the three pyramids and the Sphinx, the museum will be the world’s largest dedicated to a single civilization. It will display over 50,000 artifacts detailing life in ancient Egypt. World leaders, including monarchs, heads of states and governments, are set to attend the grand opening ceremony, according to the Egyptian presidency which touted the museum as “an exceptional event in the history of human culture and civilization.” The museum is one of the megaprojects championed by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi since he took office in 2014. He has embarked on massive investments in infrastructure with the aim of reviving an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered by the unrest that followed the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. Preparations for the grand reveal have been shrouded in secrecy. The museum, which was opened for limited visits in recent years, has been closed for the past two weeks. The government has revamped the areas around the museum and the nearby Giza Pyramids. Roads were paved and a metro station is being constructed outside the museum gates to improve access. An airport, Sphinx International Airport, has also opened west of Cairo — 40 minutes from the museum. The $1 billion facility had faced multiple delays, with construction beginning in 2005 but interrupted due to political instability. The museum, known as GEM, boasts a towering, triangular glass façade imitating the nearby pyramids, with 24,000 square meters (258,000 square feet) of permanent exhibition space. From the atrium, a grand six-story staircase lined with ancient statues leads up to the main galleries and a view of the nearby pyramids. A bridge links the museum to the pyramids, allowing tourists to move between them either on foot or via electric vehicles, according to museum officials. The museum’s 12 main galleries, which opened last year, exhibit antiquities spanning from prehistoric times to the Roman era, organized by era and by themes. Two halls are dedicated to the 5,000 artifacts from the collection of King Tutankhamun, which will be displayed in its entirely for the first time since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered King Tut’s tomb in 1922 in the southern city of Luxor. Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s most renowned archaeologist and former minister of antiquities, said the collection of Tutankhamun is the masterpiece of the museum. “Why this museum is so important, and everyone is waiting for the opening?” he told The Associated Press. “Because of Tutankhamun.” The collection includes the boy pharaoh’s three funeral beds and six chariots, his golden throne, his gold-covered sarcophagus and his burial mask, made of gold, quartzite, lapis lazuli and colored glass. The government’s aim is that the museum will draw more tourists who will stay for a while and provide the foreign currency Egypt needs to shore up its battered economy. The tourism sector has suffered during years of political turmoil and violence following the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. In recent years, the sector has started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic and the effects of Russia’s war on Ukraine — both countries are major sources of tourists visiting Egypt. A record number of about 15.7 million tourists visited Egypt in 2024, contributing about 8% of the country's GDP, according to official figures. The government aims to attract 30 million visitors annually by 2032. The museum will be open to the public starting Tuesday, authorities said. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

    "text": "CAIRO (AP) — Egypt was inaugurating the long-delayed Grand Egyptian Museum on Saturday, the world’s largest museum dedicated to its ancient civilization — a megaproject also aimed at boosting the country’s tourism industry and troubled economy. Two decades in the making and located near the Giza Pyramids on the edge of Cairo, the museum showcases over 50,000 artifacts detailing life in ancient Egypt. World leaders, including monarchs, heads of states and governments, were to attend the grand opening ceremony in the Egyptian capital, according to a statement from the presidency, which touted the museum as “an exceptional event in the history of human culture and civilization.” President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi wrote on social media that the museum will bring \"together the genius of ancient Egyptians and the creativity of modern Egyptians, enhancing the world culture and art with a new landmark that will attract all those who cherish civilization and knowledge.” The museum is one of several megaprojects championed by el-Sissi since he took office in 2014, embarking on massive investments in infrastructure with the aim of reviving an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered by the unrest that followed the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. Preparations for the grand reveal have been shrouded in secrecy. A stage was built in the museum courtyard where an orchestra and musicians would later preform what the Egyptian media described as a “global symphony of humanity.” Security around Cairo was tightened ahead of the opening ceremony, with the government announcing Saturday would be a public holiday. The museum, which has been open for limited visits over the past few years, was closed for the final, two-week preparations. The government has revamped the area around the museum and the nearby Giza Plateau that holds the pyramids and the Sphinx. Roads were paved and a metro station is being constructed outside the museum gates to improve access. An airport, Sphinx International Airport, has also opened west of Cairo — 40 minutes from the museum. The $1 billion facility had faced multiple delays, with construction beginning in 2005 but interrupted due to political instability. The museum, known as GEM, boasts a towering, triangular glass façade imitating the nearby pyramids, with 24,000 square meters (258,000 square feet) of permanent exhibition space. It opens to a granite colossus of Ramses the Great, one of ancient Egypt's most powerful pharaohs who reigned for around 60 years, from 1279 B.C. to 1213 B.C., and is credited with expanding ancient Egypt’s reach as far as modern Syria to the east and modern Sudan to the south. The statue greets visitors once they step inside the museum’s angular atrium. From the atrium, a grand six-story staircase lined with ancient statues leads up to the main galleries and a view of the pyramids. A bridge links the museum to the pyramids, allowing tourists to move between them either on foot or via electric vehicles, according to museum officials. Headlines, puzzles and death notices from the Valley delivered to your inbox 7 a.m. daily. The museum’s 12 main galleries, which opened last year, exhibit antiquities spanning from prehistoric times to the Roman era, organized by era and by themes. Two halls are dedicated to the 5,000 artifacts from the collection of King Tutankhamun — a boy pharaoh who ruled from 1361 B.C. to 1352 B.C. — that will be displayed in its entirely for the first time since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered King Tut’s tomb in 1922 in the southern city of Luxor. Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s most renowned archaeologist and former minister of antiquities, said the Tutankhamun collection is the museum's masterpiece. “Why this museum is so important, and everyone is waiting for the opening?” he told The Associated Press. “Because of Tutankhamun.” The collection includes the boy pharaoh’s three funeral beds and six chariots, his golden throne, his gold-covered sarcophagus and his burial mask, made of gold, quartzite, lapis lazuli and colored glass. The government’s hopes the museum will draw more tourists who will stay for a while and provide the foreign currency needed to shore up Egypt's battered economy. The state-run Al-Ahram daily said the museum is expected to attract 5 million visitors annually. The tourism sector has suffered during years of political turmoil and violence following the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. In recent years, the sector has started to recover after the coronavirus pandemic and amid Russia’s war on Ukraine — both countries are major sources of tourists visiting Egypt. A record number of about 15.7 million tourists visited Egypt in 2024, contributing about 8% of the country's GDP, according to official figures. Tourism and Antiquities Minister Sherif Fathy has said that overall, Egypt expects about 18 million tourists this year, with authorities hoping for 30 million visitors annually by 2032. This will translate into more jobs and pump foreign currency into the economy, said Walid el-Batouty, a tour guide. “It will be boost the economy of Egypt tremendously not just the hotels and the museum itself,” he said. Whenever a tourist rides a cab or even just buys a bottle of water, \"that is pumping money” into Egypt's coffers, he added. The museum will open to the public starting Nov. 4 — the anniversary of Carter's discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb, authorties said.

It will display over 50,000 artifacts detailing life in ancient Egypt. World leaders, including monarchs, heads of states and governments, are set to attend the grand opening ceremony, according to the Egyptian presidency which touted the museum as “an exceptional event in the history of human culture and civilization.” The museum is one of the megaprojects championed by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi since he took office in 2014. He has embarked on massive investments in infrastructure with the aim of reviving an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered by the unrest that followed the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. Preparations for the grand reveal have been shrouded in secrecy. The museum, which was opened for limited visits in recent years, has been closed for the past two weeks. The government has revamped the areas around the museum and the nearby Giza Pyramids. Roads were paved and a metro station is being constructed outside the museum gates to improve access. An airport, Sphinx International Airport, has also opened west of Cairo — 40 minutes from the museum. The $1 billion facility had faced multiple delays, with construction beginning in 2005 but interrupted due to political instability. The museum, known as GEM, boasts a towering, triangular glass façade imitating the nearby pyramids, with 24,000 square meters (258,000 square feet) of permanent exhibition space.

Preparations for the grand reveal have been shrouded in secrecy. A stage was built in the museum courtyard where an orchestra and musicians would later preform what the Egyptian media described as a “global symphony of humanity.” Security around Cairo was tightened ahead of the opening ceremony, with the government announcing Saturday would be a public holiday. The museum, which has been open for limited visits over the past few years, was closed for the final, two-week preparations. The government has revamped the area around the museum and the nearby Giza Plateau that holds the pyramids and the Sphinx. Roads were paved and a metro station is being constructed outside the museum gates to improve access. An airport, Sphinx International Airport, has also opened west of Cairo — 40 minutes from the museum. The $1 billion facility had faced multiple delays, with construction beginning in 2005 but interrupted due to political instability. The museum, known as GEM, boasts a towering, triangular glass façade imitating the nearby pyramids, with 24,000 square meters (258,000 square feet) of permanent exhibition space. It opens to a granite colossus of Ramses the Great, one of ancient Egypt's most powerful pharaohs who reigned for around 60 years, from 1279 B.C. to 1213 B.C., and is credited with expanding ancient Egypt’s reach as far as modern Syria to the east and modern Sudan to the south. The statue greets visitors once they step inside the museum’s angular atrium.

    "text": "Earlier this week, Garmin returned with new updates for its recent Forerunner 570 and Forerunner 970 smartwatches (curr. $749 on Amazon). Rolled out as Beta Version 15.13 for the former and Beta Version 15.12 for the latter, the updates contained the same changelog with various bug fixes and a change that removed Garmin's sleep mode shortcut. Now, the company has transitioned both smartwatches to v15.16. Also on its Beta Program, the update appears to be only available via manual installation for the time being. Thus, one must navigate through the Main menu, Settings, System and Software Update by tapping 'Check for Updates' on a Beta Program-enrolled Forerunner 570 or a Forerunner 970 to begin the download of Beta Version 15.16 manually. In a forum post, Garmin clarifies that Public Beta Version 15.16 resolves an issue where post-activity summary pages were skipped while auto-scrolling. Additionally, the company claims to have resolved a problem that caused a device reset when manually ending sleep mode. Moreover, the new update updates translations, albeit in undefined areas. Please see Garmin's Forerunner 570 and Forerunner 970 forum posts for more details. Garmin (1) (2)",

    "title": "Tinubu to Trump: Nigeria’s constitution protects every faith, intolerance is not our identity",
    "text": "President Bola Tinubu has rejected United States President\nDonald Trump’s decision to redesignate Nigeria as a “country of particular\nconcern” over alleged religious persecution. In a statement on Saturday, Tinubu said Nigeria remains a\ndemocracy anchored on constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion and\nbelief. “Nigeria stands firmly as a democracy governed by\nconstitutional guarantees of religious liberty,” the president said. “The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant\ndoes not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the\nconsistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of\nreligion and beliefs for all Nigerians.” Trump had on Friday announced via his Truth Social platform\nthat Nigeria had been redesignated on the US religious freedom watchlist as a\n“country of particular concern”. The move follows growing criticism by some US lawmakers,\nAmerican evangelical groups and lobbyists who allege persecution of Christians\nin parts of Nigeria. However, Tinubu described those claims as inaccurate and\nunhelpful, adding that his administration has maintained open and active\nengagement with leaders of both major religions since assuming office in 2023. “Since 2023, our administration has maintained an open and\nactive engagement with Christian and Muslim leaders alike and continues to\naddress security challenges which affect citizens across faiths and regions,”\nhe said. Tinubu said his government continues to invest in security\nreforms to protect communities from terrorism and banditry, regardless of\nreligious affiliation. He noted that violent groups operating in parts of the\ncountry target both Christians and Muslims, undermining national peace and\nunity. “Religious freedom and tolerance have been core tenets of\nour collective identity and shall always remain so. Nigeria opposes religious\npersecution and does not encourage it,” the president said. He reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to\ncollaborating with the US and other international partners to deepen\nunderstanding, promote coexistence, and strengthen mechanisms that protect\nvulnerable communities. “Our administration is committed to working with the United\nStates government and the international community to deepen understanding and\ncooperation on protection of communities of all faiths,” Tinubu said. “Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to\nprotect citizens of all faiths. Intolerance is not our identity.” Nigeria was first designated as a “country of particular\nconcern” by the Trump administration in 2020 but was removed from the list in\n2021 by former President Joe Biden.",

    "text": "Eanna Burke of St Thomas' in action against Kieran Hanrahan of Loughrea. Pic: Michael P Ryan/Sportsfile Galway SHC final: Loughrea 1-15 St Thomas’ 1-14 St Thomas’ suffered their first ever Galway SHC final defeat when they were edged out by their neighbours Loughrea at Pearse Stadium. St Thomas’ had won all eight previous finals but were chasing this one from the outset and never led in the contest played in difficult conditions in front of a crowd of 4,200. A goal in the final minute of regular time from Darren Shaughnessy proved decisive but St Thomas’ made them sweat all the way when Conor Cooney struck 1-1 in the dying minutes. St Thomas’ opted to play against the breeze in the opening half and found themselves 0-11 to 0-6 at the break with Loughrea getting off to a blistering start with points from Vince Morgan, Anthony Burns and Tiernan Killeen in the opening four minutes. The standard of hurling was good despite the wet and windy conditions and St Thomas’, with five players starting who had featured in all eight previous county title wins and another five on the bench with the full haul, used all their experience to get into the game. Conor Cooney got them off the mark with a point from play from 45 metres before captain Eanna Burke set up Darren Farrell for a point and cut the gap to 0-3 to 0-2 after nine minutes. Burns, who finished the opening half with four points from play, swapped scores with Cooney before Ian Hanrahan and Burns made it double scores at 0-6 to 0-3 at the end of the opening quarter. Loughrea, who had seven wides in the opening half with the wind, had a handful of goal chances but couldn’t convert against a St Thomas’ side who had only conceded one goal in their five games to the final. Another Cooney free, won by Eanna Ryan, reduced the margin but Loughrea hit a good patch and led by 0-9 to 0-4 after 25 minutes with Darren Shaughnessy, Burns and Vince Morgan finding the range. Farrell stemmed the flow with his second point but Loughrea led by five at the interval after Tiernan Killeen and Shane Morgan scored either side of Cooney’s third free for St Thomas’. Two frees from Cooney cut the gap to a goal inside three minutes of the restart but then after a free for all involving almost two dozen players, Loughrea extended their lead with efforts from Tiernan Killeen and Shaughnessy. Victor Manso became only the third St Thomas’ player to score when his point cut the gap to 0-13 to 0-9 after 43 minutes and Darragh Burke got the margin down to a goal going into the final quarter. Loughrea should have wrapped it up but Vince Morgan hit the crossbar after bearing down on goal and then moments later he flashed another goal effort wide from a tight angle from close range. The sides twice exchanged points before two more Cooney frees reduced the margin to 0-15 to 0-13 as the game went into the first of five minutes of stoppage time.

    "title": "Sewing change, one bag at a time",
    "text": "In a province still drowning in polythene, despite ban, plastic bags continue to plague K-P Despite the ban on polythene bags, they are still being produced, sold, and used across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), laments Seema Babar, a social worker, who makes cloth bags and distributes them free of cost to people, in order to discourage the use of plastic bags and protect the environment from their harmful effects. Forty-nine-year-old Babar, from Pirpai village of Nowshera district in K-P is leading an initiative to reduce plastic waste in our society for the last some six years. “Few years ago, when the provincial government banned the manufacturing and sale of plastic bags in the province, I decided to make cotton bags and distribute them among people to raise awareness and promote the use of cloth bags, instead of plastic which cause pollution. “I first started this initiative in my village and later expanded the campaign to the main city and other parts of Nowshera district,” Seema Babar told The Express Tribune. She runs a women’s skill centre in her village, where women and young girls come to learn sewing and other handicraft skills. “During the training, the participants first make cloth bags using various types of raw and old fabric provided by relatives and neighbours. The bags carry anti-plastic and awareness slogans. After initial training, they practice stitching clothes and learn other skills,” she said. She added that in the past most plastic pollution was seen in urban areas, but now the waste can be observed in fields, crops, and irrigation channels in rural areas as well, affecting the environment where people once breathed fresh air and enjoyed lush greenery. “When the ban on use of plastic bags was imposed, people took our campaign seriously,” she says. “But over time, most of them do not pay attention to our cause and have gone back to using polythene bags.” While sharing people’s reactions, she said that when she and her team distributed cotton bags, many people accepted them with a smile, reflecting how a small group of females could change the community’s mindset to adopt reusable bags instead of plastic bags. According to Muhammad Tahir, a vegetable vendor in Mardan city, when the provincial government imposed a ban on polythene bags, the use of non-biodegradable bags decreased, and instead vendors and traders mostly began to use biodegradable plastic bags. “However, due to the low durability of biodegradable bags, lack of government monitoring, and customer demand, non-biodegradable bags have made a comeback and openly are used for daily shopping,” he added. A single cotton bag must be reused 50 to 150 times to have a lower environmental impact than a single-use plastic bag, according to a 2020 United Nations report. However, the exact number depends on the specific impact being measured, as a UK study found a cotton bag needs to be used 131 times to offset climate change, and thousands of times for comparable overall environmental impact. The effectiveness of cotton bags hinges on consumers consistently reusing them, as the production of one cotton bag is more energy-intensive than one plastic bag. Cotton bags have undoubtedly transformed consumer trends by offering a sustainable and practical alternative to single-use plastic bags. As consumers continue to prioritize sustainability in their purchasing decisions, the popularity of cotton bags is expected to grow even further, driving positive change towards a greener and more environmentally conscious future. By choosing cotton bags, consumers can make a tangible difference in reducing plastic waste and promoting a more sustainable way of life. In 2017, the provincial government of KP banned the use of polythene bags. However, after number of litigations, in 2022, amendments were introduced to the KP Environmental Protection Act 2014, which enforced a complete ban on plastic shopping bags across the province. According to officials of the KP Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), letters were dispatched to development authorities such as the Galiyat Development Authority, Kaghan Development Authority and Kumrat Development Authority to ensure implementation of the ban in all jurisdictions. All commissioners across the province were also directed to carry out operations against the use of these hazardous bags, they added. The EPA has prosecuted manufacturing units and wholesale dealers who violated the law, and soon these powers will be delegated to deputy and assistant commissioners as well, officials said. According to data obtained from The Water and Sanitation Services Company Peshawar (WSSP), the company collects about 500 tons of solid waste every day from 42 union councils of district Peshawar, which is then dumped at an authorised site on the outskirts of the provincial capital, Peshawar. The data shows that the waste consists of 10 percent plastic, 49 percent biodegradable materials, 9.4 percent paper, and 11 percent wood, among other materials. According to the company, the waste is scientifically managed by covering it with soil and spraying it before disposal. A sanitary landfill site has also been established to ensure that underground water reserves are not contaminated by the waste. Babar said that in the early days of the campaign, the district administration and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) supported her cause and extended their help, but over time, their interest has faded away. She added that even the use of biodegradable polythene bags has is not seen any more as people are seen using non-biodegradable bags which created pollution. “In the early days of the plastic bag ban, the district administration and NGOs arranged awareness sessions in different areas in which we also participated,” she says. “But now such activities are no longer taking place and we take the initiative to carry out awareness drives independently.” “Our mission to promote the use of cotton bags instead of plastic bags still continues,” Babar shares. “The women working at my centre, along with my neighbours and relatives, still use cotton bags, which is very important for raising awareness and discouraging the use of plastic bags.” According to United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 2023 report, Pakistan produced 3.9 million tonnes of plastic waste in 2020, over 65 per cent of which was mismanaged. The report also states that 18 per cent of municipal solid waste produced in Pakistan is plastics. Only three percent of plastic used by the manufacturing industry in Pakistan is recycled material. In 2019, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) imposed a ban on the manufacturing, import, sale, purchase, storage, and use of polythene bags in the Islamabad Capital Territory. About the adverse impact of polythene bags on the environment, professor Dr Muhammad Nafees Khan, a faculty member of the department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Peshawar, told The Express Tribune that the regular use of polythene bags was a major threat to the environment. He added that when they are burned, they cause air pollution, when they are thrown into rivers, they pollute the water and endanger aquatic life and when they are dumped in the earth, they cause reduced crop production. Dr Khan added that placing food items with a temperature from 20 to 25 degrees celsius in polythene bags can cause cancer in the human body, as cancer-causing aldehyde compounds leach from the bag into the food. “When plastic bags are exposed to ultraviolet radiation and water, they break down into microplastics, which, when entering the human body through breathing, can affect the lungs,” he said, adding that due to the choking of drainage systems, they are also causing urban flooding in city areas. He mentioned that the best alternative to these hazardous bags is cotton bags and stressed that raising awareness is very important for promoting their use. “To reduce and control plastic waste, discarded polythene bags should be converted into Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) for use in large industries such as steel mills, cement factories, and other industrial units that require high temperatures for production,” he suggests. “This approach will help keep the environment free from plastic waste, while industries will benefit from a cheaper source of energy.” Dr Syed Waqas Ali Shah, a faculty member in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, told The Express Tribune that plastic bags have a harmful impact on both climate change and natural habitats. Since polythene bags were made from fossil fuels, he explained that the industries that produce them emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming and air pollution. “Because of their easy use, the consumption of these hazardous bags is also on a large scale. According to a report, around one million plastic bags are used worldwide every minute. In developing countries like Pakistan, most of them are dumped in open areas instead of being recycled, which has adverse effects on the environment, ecosystems, and living beings as well,” he says. Syed Waqas Ali Shah pointed out that due to the rapid production of plastic bags in large quantities, more landfill space is occupied and dumping them on the ground causes frequent clogging of drains and waterways both in villages and city areas as its decomposition takes hundreds of years. He said that when those bags were flow into rivers and seas they polluted water and endangers marine life. “Many aquatic animals consume plastic bags thinking they are food, which affects their stomachs and intestines and often leads to their deaths. In the rivers of the Peshawar Valley, we once observed a population of turtles that has now almost vanished. In other countries, similar species have become rare due to the presence of plastic bags in rivers and seas,” Shah explained. He suggested that, along with the implementation of laws, raising public awareness about the hazards of polythene bags and imposing heavy taxes on their production is also crucial. As Babar’s village, Pirpai, is located near the Kabul River in Nowshera district, the residents are vulnerable to floods during the monsoon season. Apart from making cloth bags, Babar has also taken initiatives to address the adverse impacts of climate change, which have changed the pattern and severity of rainfall water level in rivers. “As the district youth coordinator, I have formed several groups of young women who receive training and visit local communities to raise awareness about climate change, tree plantation, energy saving and water conservation in Nowshera district,” she shares, adding that these members also arrange free plants for plantation drives and coordinate with the district administration to take part in government sessions.

    "title": "Europe Leads the Charge on Aviation Sustainability with SAF Mandates and Innovation",
    "text": "Published on\nNovember 2, 2025 Europe is steadily advancing toward greener skies, with the aviation industry accelerating its shift towards sustainability. The key driver? Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a biofuel made from renewable resources that reduces carbon emissions and is integral to achieving Europe’s ambitious carbon-neutral goals. With recent regulations, such as the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, the aviation industry is witnessing a transformative shift in fuel consumption.What Are SAF Mandates?Advertisement  Since January 2025, European airports have been mandated to blend a minimum of 2% SAF with conventional jet fuel. This percentage will increase incrementally, reaching 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. These regulations are part of the European Union’s broader strategy to decarbonize the aviation sector. ReFuelEU Aviation, an EU regulation first drafted in 2021, aims to make SAF the primary fuel for aircraft departing from European airports, bolstering sustainable aviation while fostering innovation and growth in the biofuel sector.The Role of SAF in DecarbonizationAdvertisement  The EU’s SAF mandate plays a critical role in achieving the aviation industry’s carbon neutrality by 2050. Aviation contributes significantly to global emissions, and while carbon offsetting strategies exist, SAF provides a tangible solution for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint. As SAF production scales, its environmental benefits will only increase, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and helping meet global climate goals.Challenges to SAF Production and the Need for InvestmentAdvertisement  Despite the positive impact of SAF, production in Europe is not without its hurdles. SAF is still in its early stages of development, and Europe’s capacity to produce it is far from meeting the growing demand. The cost of SAF production is high, and regulatory uncertainty remains. While countries like the US have provided financial incentives to encourage SAF production, Europe’s reliance on regulatory measures, like the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, falls short in addressing the upfront investment challenges faced by SAF producers.Europe’s SAF Supply Chain Needs StrengtheningThe current SAF supply chain in Europe is still underdeveloped. While demand is increasing, the supply remains limited, creating an imbalance in the market. Europe’s refineries are adapting to produce SAF, but with geopolitical challenges and concerns about feedstock supply chains, such as the reliance on used cooking oil, the region faces risks that may hinder long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, policymakers must focus on strengthening the SAF supply chain through incentives, clearer legislative frameworks, and better financial backing.Aviation Leaders Push for Clearer LegislationThe aviation industry is committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but experts argue that more coordinated financial support is needed. Business aviation manufacturers and industry stakeholders have urged the EU to simplify regulations and provide stronger financial incentives. According to Kyle Martin, VP of European affairs at the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), a shift in focus towards innovation and competitiveness, rather than solely sustainability, is vital for achieving both goals.At the same time, European authorities have expressed caution about the pace of SAF development. In February 2025, the Airports Council International (ACI) Europe warned that further EU support was necessary to meet the ambitious targets set for 2050. The alliance called for a more comprehensive SAF industrial policy, increased financing, and a reduction in the regulatory burden.The Future of SAF in Europe: Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and Next-Generation FuelsAs Europe looks to expand its SAF production capabilities, next-generation fuels are gaining attention. Power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, produced using green hydrogen and carbon feedstocks, offer a promising alternative to current SAF pathways. Europe is exploring these innovative solutions as part of its commitment to reducing reliance on traditional fossil fuels. While PtL fuels hold significant potential, they are still in the pilot phase, and scaling up production will require substantial investment and technological advancements.Opportunities for Travelers: A Greener Way to FlyFor global travelers, the shift towards SAF means cleaner air travel options in the future. Major airports in Europe, including Paris Le Bourget, London Luton, and London Farnborough, are leading the way in SAF adoption. As demand grows, airports and airlines are working to ensure SAF availability for passengers. This transition not only benefits the environment but also aligns with travelers’ increasing desire for sustainable travel options.By supporting the adoption of SAF, travelers can contribute to a greener aviation industry while enjoying the benefits of cleaner, more sustainable flights. As Europe’s aviation industry navigates these challenges and opportunities, the future of air travel looks brighter and more eco-friendly than ever.Conclusion: Europe’s Bold Steps Towards a Sustainable Aviation FutureEurope’s commitment to sustainable aviation through SAF mandates is a significant step in the fight against climate change. While challenges remain in scaling production, the EU’s proactive approach is setting the stage for a greener future.

To address these challenges, policymakers must focus on strengthening the SAF supply chain through incentives, clearer legislative frameworks, and better financial backing.Aviation Leaders Push for Clearer LegislationThe aviation industry is committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but experts argue that more coordinated financial support is needed. Business aviation manufacturers and industry stakeholders have urged the EU to simplify regulations and provide stronger financial incentives. According to Kyle Martin, VP of European affairs at the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), a shift in focus towards innovation and competitiveness, rather than solely sustainability, is vital for achieving both goals.At the same time, European authorities have expressed caution about the pace of SAF development. In February 2025, the Airports Council International (ACI) Europe warned that further EU support was necessary to meet the ambitious targets set for 2050.

SAF is still in its early stages of development, and Europe’s capacity to produce it is far from meeting the growing demand. The cost of SAF production is high, and regulatory uncertainty remains. While countries like the US have provided financial incentives to encourage SAF production, Europe’s reliance on regulatory measures, like the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, falls short in addressing the upfront investment challenges faced by SAF producers.Europe’s SAF Supply Chain Needs StrengtheningThe current SAF supply chain in Europe is still underdeveloped.

Adjatay Dabbs had six receptions for 117 yards, including a 63-yard touchdown. CJ Miller added 111 yards rushing, scoring twice, for the Bears. Caleb Easterling had a 100-yard kickoff return for Furman. Rashad Rochelle caught four passes for 84 yards and two touchdowns and tacked on a 95-yard kick-return score as Indiana State pulled off an improbable upset of South Dakota State, 24-12 on Saturday. It’s the first-ever win against a top-five opponent for the Sycamores (3-6, 1-4 Missouri Valley Conference), as SDSU entered the matchup fifth in the FCS coaches’ poll. Indiana State last defeated SDSU on Oct. 1, 2011, 38-28. Indiana State trailed for just 14 seconds of game time, as Rochelle’s 95-yard return gave them a 7-3 lead after the Jackrabbits opened the game with a 44-yard field goal. Kimal Clark (15 total tackles, 1 sack) and Nic Yatsko (14 total tackles, 1 forced fumble) were dominant in the secondary, who allowed 226 passing yards and held SDSU (7-2, 3-2) to one touchdown. Jeff Sims sets an Arizona State quarterback rushing record with 228 yards, leading the Sun Devils to a 24-19 victory over Iowa State. He breaks the record with an 88-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. The previous record was set in 1978 by Mark Malone. The Cyclones lose their fourth straight game after being stopped a yard short on a crucial fourth down. Sims also completes 13 of 24 passes for 174 yards. Iowa State quarterback Rocco Becht throws for 186 yards. Arizona State shows more discipline, committing only five penalties compared to 12 last week. ---------------------------------------------------- Quentin Hayes accounted for three fourth-quarter touchdowns as The Citadel scored 28 unanswered points to come back against VMI, 35-24 on Saturday. The Bulldogs (4-5, 3-3 Southern Conference) trailed 24-7 after an early-fourth quarter field goal by VMI;s Ben Shrewsbury, but a 6-yard scoring rush from Hayes two minutes later started the rally. Hayes heaved a 72-yard touchdown pass to Jihad Marks for a score just 26 seconds after getting possession back, and Garrison Johnson Sr. added an 11-yard touchdown run to pull ahead with 4:33 remaining. Marks and Hayes linked up for another score, this time a 33-yarder with 12 seconds to go, to add some late insurance. Collin Shannon was 21-for-29 passing for 261 yards and two touchdowns for the Keydets (1-8, 0-5). Memphis has suspended Ja Morant for its game against the Toronto Raptors, citing conduct detrimental to the team. Morant scored only eight points in Memphis’ loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday. He seemed disengaged at times and walked away from the bench during a time-out. This suspension is part of a series of disciplinary actions against Morant. He was suspended twice in 2023 for incidents involving guns, costing him 33 games and about $8.3 million in salary. Morant is in the third year of a five-year contract and is averaging 20.8 points per game this season. Katin Houser threw two touchdown passes and East Carolina scored the final 31 points in a 45-14 romp over Temple. Houser tossed a 7-yard touchdown pass to Yannick Smith on the seventh play from scrimmage for a 7-0 lead. Ja’Marley Riddle picked off Evan Simon three plays after Pooh Lawton intercepted a Houser pass, and Anthony Smith scored on a first-play 45-yard run to put East Carolina (5-3, 3-1 American Athletic Conference) up 14-0. After Keveun Mason scored on a 29-yard run early in the second quarter to pull Temple even, Mike Wright Jr. scored on a 15-yard run and Houser and Yannick Smith teamed up for a 59-yard score and a 28-14 halftime advantage. The San Francisco 49ers have placed defensive lineman Yetur Gross-Matos on injured reserve after he re-injured his hamstring during practice. Gross-Matos initially hurt his hamstring in Week 5 against the Rams and missed three games. He returned to practice Thursday but got hurt again. The 49ers are already missing two other defensive linemen, including star Nick Bosa. San Francisco ranks last in the NFL in sacks per game. The team acquired Keion White from New England and signed Clelin Ferrell to the practice squad. The 49ers also promoted offensive lineman Nick Zakelj and activated Spencer Burford. Julian Sayin passed for 316 yards and four touchdowns as top-ranked Ohio State defeated Penn State 38-14. The Buckeyes led 17-14 at halftime but took control in the second half, scoring on three of their first four possessions. Jeremiah Smith scored twice, including a highlight-reel grab in the fourth quarter. Sayin completed 20 of 23 passes, joining Geno Smith as the only players since 1985 with three games in a season of 300 yards passing, three touchdowns, no interceptions and at least 85% completion. Penn State has dropped five straight games. Andy Peters accounted for five touchdowns — two through the air and three on the ground — and St. Thomas-Minnesota rolled to a 45-0 victory over Marist. St. Thomas-Minnesota (6-3, 4-2 Pioneer Football League) linebacker Ryan Sever stuffed Tristan Shannon for no gain on a fourth-and-1 run at the Marist 38-yard line on the game’s opening possession and it was all downhill for the Red Foxes (3-6, 1-4) from there. Peters fired a touchdown pass to Quentin Cobb-Butler on the next play to put the Tommies ahead. Elliot Huether’s punt bounced off Marist’s Trevion Adcox and Mitchell Schares recovered at the Red Foxes’ 16-yard line. Five plays later Peters ran it in from a yard out and Gabriel Abel added a two-point run for a 15-0 advantage after one quarter. TOKYO (AP) — It is hard to escape Shohei Ohtani in Japan, even while the country was glued to its own World Series equivalent. Collin Hurst threw two touchdown passes and caught a pass for another score, leading Presbyterian to a 43-14 victory over Valparaiso. The FCS No. 21 Blue Hose were leading 16-0 in the second quarter when they put backup quarterback Ty Englehart into the game. Hurst stayed on the field and caught a 12-yard pass from Englehart for a 23-0 halftime lead. Hurst was 26 of 32 passing for 278 yards and threw two touchdown passes to Dominic Kibby. Valpo’s Rowan Keefe threw for 225 yards. Presbyterian is 8-1 for the first time since the 1959 team posted a regular-season mark of 9-1. Wofford's defense shined in a 26-16 win over Samford 26-16 on Saturday. Maximus Pulley and Eli Campbell both returned interceptions for touchdowns. Pulley's first pick-6 was for 25 yards, followed by another interception that set up a rushing touchdown. Campbell's 42-yard pick-6 early in the second half extended the lead. Despite being outgained 351-191, Wofford's defense made the difference with four interceptions and a safety. Samford struggled with just 19 yards rushing. Their quarterbacks combined for 332 passing yards but had the four interceptions. Jake Garner kicked three field goals for Samford. Jake Stearney threw for 246 yards, Luke Vogeler kicked a 34-yard field goal in overtime and Colgate beat Merrimack 23-20 in a non-conference matchup. Colgate’s Adam DeSantis intercepted Ayden Pereira on Merrimack’s second play of overtime to help set up Vogeler’s game winner. Merrimack's Carlton Thai kicked a 47-yard field goal with 41 seconds left in regulation to tie the score at 20 apiece. Scotty Fox Jr. threw for 157 yards and accounted for three touchdowns as West Virginia snapped its five-game losing streak with a 45-35 win over No. 22 Houston.

Diore Hubbard rushed for 108 yards and a touchdown, and Cyncir Bowers added 65 yards rushing and a touchdown as the Mountaineers (3-6, 1-5 Big 12) outrushed Houston 246-82. West Virginia forced four Houston turnovers and converted it into 17 points. Carter Cravens linked with Bronson England on a 4-yard touchdown pass with 1:06 remaining to complete Morehead State’s comeback win over Davidson, 28-24 on Saturday. The Eagles (5-5, 3-3 Pioneer Football League) rallied from an 11-point fourth-quarter deficit to win their third straight game and get back to .500 for the first time since Week 4. Garnett Davis III scored on his only carry of the game, a 1-yard rush with 7:11 left to get Morehead State within one score. After an interception by Davidson on the next drive, the Eagles had a 30-yard field goal try blocked. Morehead State’s defense forced a three-and-out to send the offense back onto the field. Isaac Stopke ran for 115 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries, scoring on Morehead State’s first drive of the game. Jack Snyder threw for a touchdown and ran for another, Mitchell Summers rushed for 93 yards and two touchdowns, and Sacred Heart beat New Haven 35-20. Sacred Heart (6-3) improved to 4-0 at home this season. Snyder connected with Dean Hangey for a 43-yard score on Sacred Heart’s first play of the fourth quarter and the quarterback added a 34-yard scoring run with 3:16 left for a 35-13 lead.

Victor Snow returned a punt 65 yards for a touchdown, Red Murdock set an NCAA record for forced fumbles, and Buffalo defeated Bowling Green 28-3. Late in the second quarter, Murdock forced a fumble that was recovered by Buffalo’s Jalen McNair and returned 20 yards to the Bowling Green 6-yard line. The Bulls cashed it in for a 21-0 halftime lead. Murdock’s forced fumble was the 17th of his career, breaking the FBS record held by Khalil Mack, who also played for the Bulls. Buffalo forced a three-and-out to open the third quarter and Snow’s long punt return made it 28-0 early in the third. Al-Jay Henderson had 119 yards rushing, including a 41-yard TD run for Buffalo. Katie Uhlaender's attempt to become the first American woman to make six Olympic skeleton teams faces a setback. She didn't qualify for the U.S. World Cup team, which was finalized Saturday after selection races in Park City, Utah. The team includes world silver medalist Mystique Ro and others. Uhlaender's Olympic hopes aren't over, as the roster will be re-evaluated mid-season. The team will soon head to Europe for training, with the first World Cup races in Italy on November 21. Uhlaender was the top American at the 2022 Beijing Games, finishing sixth. TORONTO — Once again, the planets have aligned for Shohei Ohtani. Tre’ Holloway scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, Maurice LaPierre had three sacks, and Tennessee Tech scored 24 unanswered points to beat Gardner-Webb 27-21 on Sunday and extend its winning streak to 14 games, the longest in FCS football. The Golden Eagles (9-0, 6-0 OVC-Big South) took their first lead eight seconds into the fourth quarter after securing a sack fumble on Cole Pennington. Kekoa Visperas found Holloway for a 43-yard touchdown two plays later. Sebastian Coe would love to see a cross-country running race brought back to the Olympics at the 2030 Winter Games. The World Athletics president believes IOC president Kirsty Coventry is open to exploring new ideas. Cross country was last in the Summer Olympics in 1924 but was removed because of harsh conditions. Including it in the Winter Games could attract more countries, especially African nations. Coe also mentioned the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where track events will start in the first week. He highlighted a new event called RUN X and expressed excitement about the upcoming Ultimate Championships in Budapest. 1860 Munich has apologized after a fan racially abused Energie Cottbus forward Justin Butler during a match on Saturday. The club says it will fully investigate the incident and hold the spectator accountable. The game was almost called off after Butler was subjected to monkey chants. Players, stewards, and fans helped identify the alleged perpetrator, who was handed over to police. The stadium announcer addressed the incident, and 1860 supporters chanted “Nazis out!” Play resumed after a 10-minute interruption. Referee Konrad Oldhafer says Butler informed him about the abuse, and the game continued after Butler confirmed he could play. Veteran backup Jacoby Brissett will start his third straight game at quarterback for the Arizona Cardinals on Monday night while Kyler Murray continues to recover from a lingering foot injury. Coach Jonathan Gannon confirmed on Saturday that Brissett would start on the road against the Dallas Cowboys. Murray — who has a 9-0 career record at AT&T Stadium going back to his high school career — could still be active and have a role if his foot improves over the next 48 hours. Murray has been listed as limited on this week’s practice reports. The two-time Pro Bowl selection hasn’t played since Oct. 5 against the Tennessee Titans. T.J. Harden scored on a 1-yard run in overtime, and SMU upset No. 10 Miami 26-20 on Saturday, handing the Hurricanes their second loss in three weeks and damaging their playoff hopes. Casey Mittelstadt and Viktor Arvidsson scored third-period goals and the Boston Bruins extended their winning streak to three games with a 2-1 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes. The Bruins opened the season with three consecutive wins, then lost six in a row and have now won four of five overall. Mittelstadt opened the scoring at 1:27 of the third when he got his fourth of the season off a pass from Charlie McAvoy. Arvidsson added his third of the season at 5:05, sneaking the puck over the right shoulder of Frederik Andersen on a break. Mittelstadt and McAvoy assisted on the goal. T.J. Harden scored on a 1-yard run in overtime, and SMU upset No. 10 Miami 26-20, handing the Hurricanes their second loss in three weeks and damaging their playoff hopes. Ahmaad Moses put the Mustangs in position to win even with a field goal by intercepting Carson Beck just short of the goal line on the first possession of the extra period. Harden’s score came on the last of his four consecutive runs as the Mustangs won their 13th consecutive home conference game a week after losing an ACC regular-season game for the first time in their second season since returning to a power league. Darcy Graham’s hat trick tied teammate Duhan van der Merwe’s Scotland try-scoring record as the United States was thrashed 85-0 in Edinburgh. Scotland scored 13 tries and 10 conversions in its highest ever score at its century-old home and third highest all-time. Graham and scrumhalf Jamie Dobie bagged three tries each, Van der Merwe got a double, and there were also scores for Dylan Richardson, Kyle Rowe, captain Stafford McDowall, Ollie Smith and George Horne, who tallied 15 points. The U.S. qualified in September for the 2027 Rugby World Cup but was poor in its first visit to Murrayfield in 25 years. Cale Hellums threw a 42-yard pass to Brady Anderson with 24 seconds left and Dawson Jones made a game-winning 27-yard field goal on the final play to give Army a 20-17 victory over Air Force. Army (4-4) has won seven of the last nine meetings with Air Force (2-6), including three in a row. It was a wild final two minutes. Hellums was stopped on a fourth-and-1 sneak deep in Army territory with 2:10 left. The Falcons took advantage of the great field position, and a pass interference call in the end zone, to tie it at 17-all on Liam Szarka’s 2-yard sneak with 1:26 left. Hellums started the game-winning drive with a 10-yard pass and then Army ran it four straight plays. Hellums’ ninth pass attempt went to Anderson.

    "title": "TV scores twice in second half to claim title",
    "text": "Twin Valley and Caledonia United battled through a scoreless first half and after more than 10 minutes ticked off the second-half clock, fans had to be wondering if a goal would ever come. Then it happened on Brayden Brown's direct kick from about 20 yards 11:11 into the second half. \"We thought (at halftime) that we would score on a set piece. We work on those ad nauseum,\" Twin Valley coach Buddy Hayford said. Brown's ball that went just under the crossbar before rippling the high portion of the net was the impetus for the 2-0 victory and the Wildcats' state championship. Brown said he practices direct kicks at different distances. \"It felt good,\" Brown said of the moment the ball left his foot. \"I bent it a little bit. \"I was visioning it going under the bar and into the net.\" Brown knew it had to be a great shot to beat Cal United goalie Josh Peterson. \"He is a really good keeper. He made some great saves,\" Brown said. Petersen was so good that he prompted Hayford to change his game plan at halftime. \"We made an adjustment because their keeper was so mobile,\" Hayford said. \"He was able to pick everything off so we stopped being so vertical and instead played the ball wide. We stopped playing through balls and made more angle passes.\" A one-goal lead with that much time remaining did little to calm Hayford's nerves. \"The second goal was the thing. I didn't feel good about a one-goal lead against a team like that. They were 16-0 and very good,\" Hayford said. The insurance goal came with 13:04 remaining, a low bullet into the corner off the foot of Niko Gerding. \"Niko's shot was awesome. He kept it low and it was against the keeper's momentum,\" Hayford said. One reason the pad goal was so long in coming was a strong Cal defense spearheaded by Monaco. He had several clears under very heavy pressure. Early in the game, Hayford had to admit he was given some doubt about the Wildcats chances to take down the undefeated opponent. That was because  his team lost two-time All State center back Chris Eckert and he never did return. \"I said at that time, 'we could be in trouble,'\" Hayford said. But the Wildcats passed the next-man-up mentality with flying colors. Zack Mercier stepped into fill Eckert's role. \"He was terrific,\" Hayford said. Colton Corey saw more minutes after the injury. \"He was untested but played very well,\" Hayford said. \"And Brian Sullivan won balls in the back.\" Brayden Brown and Gerding were stellar in controlling the midfield area just as they had been all year. \"Carson McHale was a bulldog up front and his motor ran all 80 minutes,\" Hayford said. Cal United coach Peter Stratman said that to him, the game had the feel of one where the team scoring first would win. \"I thought there was a momentum shift after they scored,\" Stratman said. Stratman knows that could have just as well been one of his players finding the net first. During an even first half, they threatened goalie Kaelyn Lackey and his defense several times. Caledonia applied early pressure with River Thibault getting a good, unobstructed look and firing barely wide of the far post after only two minutes had elapsed. \"The game was frenetic in the first 10 minutes and then when everyone settled down it was an even game for the rest of the first half,\" Stratman said. Eli Russell unloaded a testing shot that Lackey made a great deflection of and Cal United came close to capitalizing on the rebound. Cal also had some scoring opportunities in the first half on balls that ping ponged around in the box, something that did not please Hayford. \"No bouncing balls in the back. We've got clear them out with our heads. If we don't, it is going to cost us,\" Hayford yelled to his defenders. But the half ended without a goal and, out of respect for Petersen, Hayford altered the method of attacking. The adjustment gave the Wildcats a significant territorial advantage as they clearly won the second 40 minutes. Cal United, a team that boasts players from Danville, Twinfield and Cabot, took the loss hard. A defeat in a state title game is never easy and it only compounds the hurt when you aren't accustomed to losing. Caledonia went through the season beating all comers and took the same 16-0 record that Twin Valley brought into Saturday night's championship game. Playing their final game for Cal United were seniors Russell, Jola Otten, Ben Monaco, Sean Lehoe, Samson Kitonga, Sam McLane, Alijah Andrews and Petersen. They couldn't appreciate being an unbeaten team all regular season. The sting of this  night was still too much. But they will eventually. It was a magical season. Twin Valley seniors Lackey, Eckert, Tucker Magnant, Steven Oyer, Pacei Reynolds, McHale, Max Nido, Nrian Sullivan and Max Mercier went out the way everyone wants to go out the door. But only team can. It was the Twin Valley Wildcats. Twin Valley fan Frances Cunningham delivered a beautiful rendition of the national anthem, but the song that will stay with the Wildcat players forever was  \"We Are the Champions\" by Queen as it blared over the loudspeaker at Rutland's Alumni Field. tom.haley@rutlandherald.com Sportswriter",

    "title": "Bihar JD(U) candidate Anant Singh arrested over Jan Suraaj worker's death in Mokama",
    "text": "Controversial former Bihar MLA Anant Singh , who seeks to reclaim Mokama seat on a ticket of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), was arrested in a late-night operation on Saturday (November 1, 2025) in connection with the murder of Jan Suraaj supporter Dular Chand Yadav, officials said. Mr. Singh, who has been under the scanner since the killing of Yadav, who recently clashed with his sympathisers, was picked up from his house in Barh, about 200 km from the State capital. Police also arrested two other persons, Manikant Thakur and Ranjeet Ram, who were also present when the incident took place. All three will soon be produced before the magistrate. Yadav died while campaigning for Jan Suraaj Party’s candidate Piyush Priyadarshi in Patna’s Mokama area on Thursday. The incident had taken place in the Mokama Taal area, which is close to Bhadaur and Ghoswari police stations. The incident had taken place close to the Bhadaur and Ghoswari police stations in the Mokama area. Addressing a late-night joint press conference with Patna District Magistrate Thyagarajan S. M., Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Patna, Kartikeya Sharma, said, “Police have arrested three persons — Anant Singh, Manikant Thakur and Ranjeet Ram — in connection with the murder of Dular Chand Yadav.” According to Yadav’s post-mortem report, he died of cardiorespiratory failure due to shock caused by injury to the heart and lungs by a hard and blunt substance, the SSP said. “Therefore, the post-mortem report and preliminary investigation suggest that it’s a case of murder,” he said. Investigations also revealed that all three were present at the time of the incident, Mr. Sharma said. “They have been arrested as part of a police investigation into the murder case of Yadav. A total of four FIRs, one pertaining to the violation of the model code of conduct, have been registered by the police to investigate the incident,” the SSP said, adding that Singh was named in one of the FIRs. The multiple-term former MLA, whose wife Neelam Devi currently represents the Mokama seat, has also been booked for model code of conduct violation as instances of his moving about in large cavalcades have come to the fore. When asked about the killing of Yadav, Mr. Singh had admitted to a clash between his supporters and the deceased, but also sought to put the blame on Suraj Bhan, his old rival in the underworld and local politics, whose wife Veena Devi is contesting the seat on an RJD ticket. Yadav, a dreaded gangster of the 1990s known to be at odds with Anant Singh, was supporting Priyadarshi Piyush, a political greenhorn fielded by Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party. Meanwhile, the Election Commission on Saturday ordered the transfer of Patna Superintendent of Police (Rural) and action against three other officials, taking a stern view of violence in Mokama, involving the killing of Yadav. “The Commission directed that Vikram Sihag, Superintendent of Police (Rural), Patna, may also be transferred. Hence, a panel of officers for posting a substitute in his place may be sent urgently,” the poll authority told the state chief electoral officer on Saturday. It ordered the appointment of new officials to replace the sub-divisional officer of Barh, who is also the returning officer of Mokama assembly seat, sub-divisional police officer Barh-1, and sub-divisional police officer Barh-2. While ordering disciplinary proceedings against the three, it also directed that Abhishek Singh, the sub-divisional police officer of Barh-2, be also placed under suspension. Bihar goes to the polls in two phases on November 6 and 11, while votes will be counted on November 14.",

    "title": "Pakistan reopens Afghan border as ceasefire holds",
    "text": "US Torkham border reopens for repatriation; Thousands return home via Chaman border Pakistan on Saturday reopened the Torkham border crossing in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa for Afghan refugees returning to their country, ending a nearly two-week closure following deadly clashes between border forces last month. Meanwhile, nearly 10,700 individuals returned through the Chaman border in a single day as authorities expanded the process to the crossing. The repatriation of Afghan families with or without any travel or identity documents was abruptly suspended on October 11 following border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which continued for days before a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on October 19. Pakistan had closed all its borders with Afghanistan for all types of movement. Since then, a large number of returning families had been impatiently waiting for the reopening of the Torkham border. Trade between the countries has remained suspended since then, leading to increased prices of essential goods, especially tomatoes. Although Islamabad and Kabul on Friday decided to extend the ceasefire, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi stated that the \"border remains closed for trade for now\" and resumption of trade would depend on the security situation. Officials previously said that all relevant staff members had been informed to ensure their presence on duty on Saturday morning. It was not clear whether Pakistanis stranded in Afghanistan would be allowed to return. According to official figures, approximately 1.56 million Afghan nationals have now returned to their homeland under the government's ongoing repatriation drive. The process was being conducted in accordance with legal and administrative protocols, ensuring that every individual's documents are verified before crossing the border. Authorities assured that the repatriation initiative was being carried out in a dignified and orderly manner and has now been extended to Torkham following its recent reopening. Officials said the Frontier Corps (FC) and the civil administration have set up temporary shelters, food supplies, and medical facilities for departing families. The state has ensured that all humanitarian needs of Afghan refugees are addressed during the transition, an official said. Similarly, Khyber Deputy Commissioner Bilal Rao confirmed the reopening, saying that the crossing had resumed operations to facilitate the repatriation of Afghan nationals. Afghan and Pakistani officials, including Khizer Shah, spokesperson of the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul, also verified the development. The repatriation process for Afghan families, both with and without valid travel or identity documents, had been suspended since October 11, when cross-border clashes broke out between security forces of the two countries. The border skirmishes, which lasted several days, were halted only after a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on October 19. Following the violence, Pakistan had closed all border crossings with Afghanistan for both trade and travel, leaving thousands of returning families stranded on either side. The shutdown also disrupted bilateral trade, triggering a spike in prices of essential goods, particularly perishable items like tomatoes, in local markets. Although Islamabad and Kabul agreed on Friday to extend the ceasefire, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the border remains closed for trade for now, adding that commercial activity would resume only after a review of the security situation. According to officials in Khyber, all relevant border staff had been directed to report for duty early Saturday to facilitate the return of refugees. However, it was not immediately clear whether Pakistani nationals stranded in Afghanistan would also be allowed to cross back into the country.

    "text": "SE Islamabad Bar Council, candidates backed by Bhoon-Tarar group won three out of five seats Preliminary results of the Punjab Bar Council elections show a clear lead for the pro-government Ahsan BhoonAzam Nazeer Tarar group. In the Islamabad Bar Council, candidates backed by the Bhoon-Tarar group won three out of five seats, while the Hamid Khan group secured one and an independent candidate claimed another. From the Bhoon group, Abdul Rehman Hur Bajwa topped the list with 1,369 votes, followed by Aalim Abbasi with 1,351 votes, Hafeezullah Yaqoob with 1,295, Zafar Khokhar with 1,288, and Asif Irfan with 1,126 votes. Hafeezullah Yaqoob of the Hamid Khan group was also elected as a member of the bar council while Zafar Khokhar won as an independent. In Rawalpindi, preliminary results for five seats were announced, with Imran Khan's counsel Faisal Mahmood among the winners. PTI-backed candidates bagged three of the five seats. Malik Fakhar Hayat secured first position with 2,927 votes, followed by Hassan Abbas Hamdani (2,022 votes), Faisal Malik (1,730), Shahid Mahmood Abbasi (1,738), and Chaudhry Qaiser Mushtaq (1,689 votes).

    "title": "'India tried to bribe Pak fisherman into spying'",
    "text": "US He drew parallels between, failed Operation Sindoor, current propaganda campaign Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Saturday revealed that India's intelligence agency had attempted to recruit a Pakistani fisherman for espionage by offering him money. Addressing a joint press conference in Islamabad alongside Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, Chaudhry said the incident was \"India's new propaganda operation, which has now been fully exposed\". He said the fisherman, identified as Ijaz Mallah, had been detained by the Indian Coast Guard in September and was subsequently coerced and bribed with Rs95,000 to take part in anti-Pakistan propaganda. \"This is part of a continuous psychological and informational war being waged by Indian intelligence agencies against Pakistan,\" he said, adding that the country's security institutions remain vigilant to counter such attempts. Chaudhry credited Pakistan's media and security institutions for \"ensuring the triumph of truth in this information war,\" and praised their responsible reporting in the face of what he termed \"yellow propaganda\". He drew parallels between the failed Operation Sindoor and the current propaganda campaign, describing them as repeated attempts by India to \"erase the humiliation of past failures\". \"After failing in Operation Sindoor, and even in sports arenas, efforts have continued to create false narratives, from fabricated operations to fake encounters. But every such attempt has been exposed,\" he said. The minister added that evidence of financial transactions and communication between Indian handlers and Mallah had been recovered. He said fake media credentials, uniforms and documents were also used to mask the operation under seemingly credible identities. He stressed Pakistan was a responsible state, saying, \"Pakistan respects the sovereignty of other nations and ensures its soil is not used against anyone. We expect the same in return\". He urged the international community and independent media to review the evidence and recognise the operation for what it was, \"a desperate bid to build a false narrative ahead of elections and amid growing political tensions in India\". \"Just like in the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the truth is once again before the world. India has been caught red-handed,\" Chaudhry added. COMMENTS (2) Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

    "title": "President salutes heroes who liberated G-B",
    "text": "US Zardari vows to make Gilgit-Baltistan a model region President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday joined the people of Gilgit-Baltistan in marking the region's 78th Independence Day, paying glowing tribute to the heroes who liberated G-B from Dogra rule and reaffirming the government's resolve to turn the region into a model of development, justice and equality. Addressing the central ceremony held at the Army Helipad Ground in Gilgit, President Zardari lauded the people of G-B for standing shoulder to shoulder with the rest of Pakistan for more than seven decades, safeguarding its borders and carrying the national flag to the world's highest peaks. \"This region is not only the crown of Pakistan but also our northern gateway, a symbol of lasting friendship with China,\" he said. He said the Karakoram Highway stands as a living testament to that friendship, while the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has brought new avenues for trade, livelihoods and connectivity throughout the region. The president emphasised that ensuring the fruits of development reach every valley and village must remain a shared national goal, fostering prosperity for all. The president said G-B's freedom struggle serves as a reminder of the unfinished journey of their \"brothers and sisters\" in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). \"While you enjoy liberty and rights under the flag of Pakistan, they continue to face occupation and repression,\" he said. \"We stand with them till they achieve freedom in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions and their own aspirations.\" Calling G-B his \"second home\", the president recalled that the people of the region gained their independence through their own struggle and voluntarily chose to join Pakistan. He said the history of G-B was filled with acts of unmatched bravery and sacrifice, noting that during the liberation movement of 1947, 1,700 people embraced martyrdom and another 30,000 were wounded. He highlighted that successive PPP governments had made landmark contributions to G-B's progress. \"Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto showed his affection for the people of G-B by abolishing the Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR) in 1974 and merging princely states into a single administrative unit,\" he said. \"Later, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto introduced a structural governance system, and the PPP federal government gave G-B a legislative assembly and the offices of governor and chief minister through constitutional amendments.\" Zardari said PPP workers from G-B had also played an active role in the country's democratic struggles, with many sacrificing their lives in Karachi and Rawalpindi. He urged the authorities to expand access to education and healthcare throughout the region and said G-B's vast water and natural resources could be utilised for power generation. The area, he added, held immense tourism potential and could even operate its own airline to promote it. The president denounced the persecution of Muslims in India and praised Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah for creating a separate homeland where all citizens could enjoy freedom and dignity. Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, in his address, paid tribute to the martyrs of the 1947 liberation movement and thanked President Zardari for gracing the ceremony. He said the PPP government's 2009 reforms had given G-B its identity and added that integrating the region into Pakistan's constitutional framework – without undermining the Kashmir issue – would thwart India's malicious designs. The chief minister lauded the sacrifices of Pakistan's armed forces and the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir, noting that Operation Bunyan al-Marsoos had further strengthened G-B's security and prestige. President Zardari later reviewed the parade and witnessed a colourful march-past and cultural floats representing all three divisions of G-B, which drew loud applause from the audience. The event was attended by the governor, chief minister, members of the legislative assembly, Commander X Corps Lt Gen Ahsan Amir Nawaz, Force Commander Northern Areas Maj Gen Syed Imtiaz Gilani, senior officials, and a large number of citizens. Earlier, the president was warmly received at Gilgit Airport by Governor Syed Mehdi Shah and the chief minister.

    "text": "The Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to extend the due date for filing Income Tax Returns (ITR) for assessees who are required to submit audit reports. The order has been pronounced by Justice Lisa Gill and Justice Meenakshi I Mehta on four writ petitions filed by the Jalandhar Income Tax Bar Association, Taxation Bar Association, Pathankot, and Income Tax practitioners. They approached the high court seeking a direction to the CBDT to extend the due date for filing of tax audit reports for a reasonable period from September 30 and as a necessary corollary to further extend the due date for filing tax returns. Counsels for petitioners submitted that audit reports and tax returns are mandatorily to be e-filled. Forms of e-filing of audit report and tax returns were made available effectively by the department only in August, thereby leading to considerable reduction of time period available to petitioners for filing tax audit reports. Certain changes were carried out in respect to tax audit reports vide notification dated March 28, 2025, however, e-filing utility was made available on August 14. The department itself acknowledged substantial changes and time required for system readiness when it extended due date for filing of tax returns in certain categories of persons other than companies. The Bench said repeated adjournments had been granted at fervent request of counsel for the Union of India on the premise that proposal regarding extension of due date for filing of Income Tax Returns in the case of auditable assessees for sssessment year 2025-26 is under submission for early decision. Position is no different even today despite of specific and categorical order dated October 13 passed by the High Court of Gujarat, which has admittedly been attained finality. The Bench said, “We find no ground whatsoever to further adjourn these writ petitions as has been suggested. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances as above, all four writ petitions are disposed of while directing respondent – the CBDT to issue necessary circular in exercise of power under Section 119 of the Act to extend the due date for filing of returns by assessees required to file audit report as per clause (a) of Explanation 2 to sub-section (1) of Section 139 of the Act or required to file report of audit under provisions of the Act for financial year 2024-2025 (Assessment year 2025-26) to November 30, 2025.

    "text": "The Himachal Pradesh Sub-tropical Horticulture, Irrigation and Value Addition Project (HP SHIVA) has drawn international attention of a high-profile business delegation from Dubai comprising Abdulla Al Ali and Sagheer Khan, who visited the state and held a high-level meeting with Project Director Dr Devender Singh Thakur, in Bilaspur today. An HP SHIVA Project Management Unit (PMU) team of the Directorate of Horticulture was also present at the meeting. Dr Thakur said the meeting focused on exploring export opportunities for fruits, including sweet oranges, pomegranates and cut flowers, including roses and carnations, produced under the HP SHIVA Project to Middle East markets, especially Dubai. He said a detailed overview of the project’s progress and achievements was given to the international guests. He said scientifically developed horticulture clusters had been established across seven districts in the state, including Bilaspur, Hamirpur, Kangra, Mandi, Una, Solan, and Sirmaur. These clusters cultivate high-yield and export-oriented varieties that meet all international standards of colour, size, sweetness and shelf life, he said. Dr Thakur said farmers were trained in good agricultural practices (GAP), precision irrigation, fertigation and integrated pest and nutrient management. He said, “There is a remarkable improvement in both the quality and consistency of production. The cluster-based model has enabled product traceability, quality consistency and volume aggregation that are key prerequisites for international buyers.” During inspection of the Karot cluster in Bilaspur, the Dubai representatives appreciated the quality of the produce, describing it as being on par with international standards, and expressed strong interest in establishing long-term export partnerships with the HP SHIVA initiative.

    "title": "Alonzo Highsmith Has Interest in Dolphins GM Job",
    "text": "Posted by Mike Oliva | Nov 1, 2025 | 2025 Season, Dolphins News | 0 Alonzo Highsmith Has Interest in Dolphins GM Job Former Miami Hurricanes running back and current New England Patriots personnel executive Alonzo Highsmith has expressed interest in the open Miami Dolphins general manager position to people, according to Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald. Highsmith was the 3rd overall pick of the 1987 NFL Draft by the Houston Oilers. During his NFL career, he played for Houston, Dallas, and Tampa. He also spent time on the Kansas City Chiefs practice squad his final year before retiring. Since retiring, Highsmith has pivoted and become an NFL Front Office executive. He got his start in Green Bay as a Senior Personnel Executive from 2012 to 2017. Then he moved to Seattle, where he was the Vice President of Player Personnel from 2018 to 2019. From 2020 to 2022, he was a personnel executive in Seattle. Then, in late 2022, he went back home to the Miami Hurricanes to be their GM of Football Operations for two seasons. And then in 2024, he became a personnel executive with the New England Patriots. At 60 years old, Highsmith is undoubtedly qualified to be an NFL general manager at this stage of his career, and the fact that he has spent time in two highly successful NFL front offices makes him an attractive candidate. With that said, there is no confirmation or report of Miami having interest in Highsmith; this is coming from Alonzo himself that he has interest in the open position. I fully expect the Miami Dolphins to cast a wide net in their search come January when they begin the process of finding a new general manager. It was reported Saturday morning by Dianna Russini that Miami is looking to reshape the vision of its front office, so do not expect Miami to only meet with a couple of people and make a quick hire come January 2026. I suspect this will drag out some, and the search will go into February, and we may not have an announcement on any new hire until around or after the Super Bowl. One thing that is ironic about this story is that before being hired by the Miami Dolphins as a scout in 2000, Chris Grier had worked for the Patriots. Like Highsmith does now. Share:",

    "title": "Shein Might Be Cheap, But Is It Legit?",
    "text": "Global e-commerce retailer Shein is known for offering cheap fashion. Not only are the items themselves priced quite low, but just going on the website's homepage, you are bombarded with pop-ups and other internal advertisements about the latest Shein sales and deals. Are the savings, however, worth it? Are you getting legitimate, high-quality fashion for a good price? It doesn't seem that way. Shein is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and only has a one-star customer review rating based on over 700 reviews on its website. Shein has also been involved in multiple lawsuits during its history. These lawsuits center on other fashion brands and artists accusing Shein of selling counterfeit products and stealing their designs. So that Coach handbag you found on Shein might not actually be Coach at all. Based in China, Shein was founded in 2008 by Chris Xu. It got its start selling wedding dresses before expanding into all of women's fashion and other miscellaneous products. It's grown to be a popular app, with billions in revenue and multiple manufacturing partnerships. It adds thousands of new items to its store daily, which can often be a red flag for quantity over quality. While you might be getting a good deal shopping at Shein — similar to Amazon's discount store Haul — it's a stretch to claim that this company is completely legit. Since Shein is not accredited by the BBB, it has not gone through the process to meet the organization's eight Standards for Trust. These standards include honest advertising, transparent business policies, responding quickly to disputes, and safeguarding customer data. While this does not necessarily mean Shein is dishonest and negligent, earning a BBB accreditation does go a long way in winning customer faith in a company's products and services. Customers are allowed to post their good and bad experiences with companies on the BBB page, even though it's not accredited. Shein's 1-star rating out of 5 possible stars is a strikingly dismal score. Complaints include items ordered not arriving and no money being returned, the wrong items being delivered, and counterfeit items that don't match the website description. It is worth noting, however, that Shein has an A rating on the BBB. The reason given is that Shein responds to customer complaints quickly. Letter grade ratings on the BBB are a direct reflection of the business's responsiveness to upset customers and are not influenced by reviews posted on the website. For comparison, three companies in Canada have earned F ratings. So when you take the whole package of no BBB accreditation, an A rating for responsiveness, and multiple customer complaints, you get a fuller picture of what to expect from shopping with Shein. Tapestry, the company that owns the fashion brand Coach, sued Shein in 2025, accusing the company of having third parties manufacture counterfeit Coach products and sell them on the website. These counterfeit items featured the Coach name and its well-known logo. In response, Shein claimed all of its products from third-party suppliers were legitimate and not knock-offs. Large companies aren't the only ones that feel their designs have been stolen by Shein. Small, independent fashion designers have also complained online about their handmade fashions being mass-produced by third parties through Shein without their permission. Shein has also been accused of copying the direct design of products, like Bottega Veneta's Cassette bag, often worn by celebrities. Shoppers may feel that they are getting a Hollywood-level bag at an ultra-cheap price. Unfortunately, there is little legal protection available for copies of unique designs outside of trademarked logos or similar brand-defining visuals. To Shein's credit, its ethical policies are stated clearly on its website. It emphasizes that its mission is to conduct business lawfully and responsibly. This includes the suppliers it works with agreeing to a set of standards and large sections about its commitment to safe work practices and no worker exploitation — the same type of issue that Temu has come under fire for. If you do shop at Shein, remember that sometimes a deal that seems too good is, in fact, too good to be true.",

    "title": "Why Kourtney Kardashian Is Reportedly ‘Upset’ With Kim And Khloé Amid New Season Of Their Reality Show",
    "text": "The Kardashians started airing for fans with a Hulu subscription last week and, given the nature of the show, it's natural to expect drama. While in front of the camera, the Kardashian-Jenner family is pretty transparent and tends to be confrontational with each other. If a source is to be believed, though, Kourtney Kardashian is now unhappy about comments made by her sisters Kim and Khloé during their confessionals. For context, during the season premiere of The Kardashians, \" Feel Like the Old Days,\" Kourtney made a snide remark about her sisters wearing corsets and tall heels while playing with their children. She suggested that she is way more comfortable in Travis Barker-esque casual clothes and made it clear she thought her sisters were silly for thinking otherwise. Ultimately, Khloé and Kim clocked the dig against them immediately, and Kim decided to share the following comments in her confessional: Good for you babe. I don’t come in and say like ‘Huh, I would never give up on life so soon.' You know, saying the opposite. It’s the passive aggressive for me. Considering Kim Kardashian said that in a confessional, Kourtney didn’t hear the \"giving up on life\" remark until the episode aired. Sometime later, a source spoke with Entertainment Tonight, telling the outlet that Kourtney was not happy after the seventh season of The Kardashians premiere. When it comes to the mother of four's alleged feelings on the matter, the source tells ET: Kourtney's been a little upset with Kim and Khloé since the new season of 'The Kardashians' started airing. She didn't know Kim made that 'giving up on life' remark and she felt really bothered by it. While the Kardashian sisters are known for bickering quite a bit, which has been showcased over the 20+ seasons of their various reality shows, things between Kourtney's relationship with the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner family has allegedly been fraught over the last few years. Kourtney and Kim especially have been at odds with each other. Everything seemed to escalate after they had a major blow-up in 2018 when Kim called Kourtney the “least exciting to look at.” Oh Man, Was Scott Disick Trolling Kim Kardashian Over Her Viral Comments About Not Knowing The Cost Of Milk? Later in 2022 when Kim Kardashian worked with Dolce and Gabbana, Kourney became upset, saying that Kim was copying her wedding style. They eventually reconciled but, since then, Kourtney has made comments about her sisters’ business strategies in general and has been critical of their value systems. Such sentiments would seemingly indicate that this conflict runs a lot deeper than a Dolce and Gabbana campaign. This repeated negative energy between the two Kardashians has allegedly caused Kourtney to distance herself from the rest of her family. As a result, she's opted out of a lot of family occasions in favor of spending more time with her husband, Travis Barker, and their immediate family. This also has been a point of contention, which may or may not be linked to the comments Khloé and Kim made about their sister. This tension feels like a through line for this upcoming season, and I’m thinking these outfit comments will could set the stage for what's to come in upcoming episodes.

    "text": "British Transport Police said they were responding to an incident on a train to Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. Two people have been arrested after a number of people were stabbed on a train to a Cambridgeshire town, police have said. Cambridgeshire Constabulary said armed police attended after officers were called to the scene at Huntingdon station at 7.39pm on Saturday. The Prime Minister said the incident was “deeply concerning” and urged people to follow police advice. In a statement on X, Sir Keir Starmer said: “The appalling incident on a train near Huntingdon is deeply concerning. “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. “Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police.” Video footage on social media showed scores of blue-light police cars and emergency vehicles in a station car park, and a team of armed police running towards the stationary train at Huntingdon station. Witnesses described seeing a man with a large knife, and passengers hiding in the toilets to escape the rampage, The Times reported. One witness told the paper there was “blood everywhere” and people were getting “stamped” on by others as they tried to flee. “I heard some people shouting we love (you),” the witness said. In their statement, British Transport Police said on X: “We are currently responding to an incident on a train to Huntingdon where multiple people have been stabbed. “Officers are in attendance alongside @CambsCops and two people have been arrested.” The attack is understood to have started shortly after the LNER train left Peterborough station. In a statement on Facebook, Cambridgeshire Constabulary said: “We were called at 7.39pm with reports that multiple people had been stabbed on a train. “Armed officers attended and the train was stopped at Huntingdon, where two men were arrested. A number of people have been taken to hospital. “The incident remains ongoing and the A1307 has been closed as you approach the town centre.” Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened” to hear of the stabbings and added: “I urge people to avoid comment and speculation at this early stage.” Huntingdon Station is closed, National Rail said, with all lines blocked. London North Eastern Railway (LNER), which operates East Coast Mainline services in the UK, confirmed the incident had happened on one of its trains and has urged passengers not to travel because of “major disruption”. In a statement on X at 9.21pm, LNER said: “We are experiencing major disruption across the LNER route. Emergency services are dealing with an incident at Huntingdon station, all lines are blocked. “Our advice is ‘Do Not Travel’. Please defer your travel where you can.” Cambridgeshire Constabulary urged anyone with information about the incident to report it online at https://www.cambs.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report quoting incident 495 of November 1, or by calling 101.",

    "text": "David joined Raw Story in 2023 after nearly a decade of writing about the legal industry for Bloomberg Law. He is also a co-founder and a commissioning editor at Hypatia Press, a publisher that specializes in philosophical works that challenge religion or spirituality. Donald Trump on Saturday threatened military action on foreign soil, escalating previous remarks about the nation. The president previously raised the possibility of sanctions against Nigeria for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians in what Trump now calls a \"disgraced country.\" Nigerian officials have forcefully denied all the allegations. Trump went even further over the weekend, specifically threatening to use a military solution to what he considers to be a problem with persecution. \"If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing,' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,\" Trump said on Truth Social Saturday. \"I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!\" See the full post here.

    "title": "Youth Growth and Empowerment",
    "text": "In this great walk of life, the things that the youth of the nation need to know are in dire need of their grooming and learning in the digital era. Well-groomed young minds equipped with training represent one of the most prominent and powerful assets for any nation. Across the world, there are more than 1.2 billion youth aged 15 to 24. In our beloved country, there is more than 60% of the population under the age of 30, which makes Pakistan the youngest nation in South Asia. Strong, academically and skilful youth of any nation potentially drive the economic growth, innovation, and social transformation. If the young minds are equipped with quality education, skill sets, mental well-being, and have the aptitudes towards social welfare services and the well-being of the people, then the nations can be proud of such individuals. The youth having such traits are capable of leading Pakistan in the true spirit. Their potential, innovation and creativity, patriotism, and resilience approach are the signs of hope. The key areas of learning for the young minds are as follows: Contemplation and pondering: In this technological era, the young minds need to know that they have only one chance at this thing called life. Gratitude in life is the most important thing to focus on what they have and not what they lack. The successful people in this world are not much smarter than the youth of this current era; whatever the great people have built, they have built dreams that changed the world. The difference was not brilliance and luck; it was just courage, bravery, and the initiatives they have taken. The comfort of their life might feel safe, but this would never lead them where they were meant to go. Sometimes, you have to lose the map and find yourself Nurturing the Young Minds: Nurturing the youth in terms of academic, social, and spiritual levels is the need of the present era that leads them towards empowerment, confidence, and motivates them to thrive in an evolving technological world. The youth of the great nation must be spiritually grounded, morally upright, and intellectually curious, guided by a strong sense of purpose. The young minds of the nation must be equipped with digital skills, innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship. Belief in Yourself: Youth must believe in their abilities and the unfolding vision. Sometimes, you have to lose the map and find yourself. The belief that no one has a vision like yours would be your superpower. You must fall in love with the process you are going through -the messy, uncertain, unglamorous middle. No one is clapping, except for you, who believes the great story still matters. Constant Struggle: Growth and empowerment a constant struggle and process that requires high willpower, commitment, dedication, and commitment by the youth. In addition, there is a need to focus on spiritual, academic, mental well-being, and social growth. Self-actualisation: The youth of Pakistan must realise that they are not the leader of tomorrow; they have the potential and strength of today. They have to build their dreams brick by fragile brick, even when they are facing frightful obstacles in their way. They have to be courageous and understand that the applause fades, but meaning lasts. They have to walk away from the places, people, and even versions of themselves that no longer fit. Sound Character: The young minds believe in their power and ability to shape the world. They must learn something and invest in their character, because true success and grace do not lie in talent, but in integrity, honesty, discipline, moral strength, and consistency. They must serve with compassion, which is the highest form of leadership to serve others. Big Dreams: Young minds must have big dreams and high willpower to achieve great success. They must realise that they are brave enough to dream big and achieve big. In addition, they must rise with unity, as it is said; united we rise, divided we fall. They must give the values to the unity instead of their belief, background, and identity; they can overcome any frightful obstacles and challenges in achieving their dreams. Responsibilities of Top Stakeholders: The top stakeholders of the country must unlock the potential of the young minds. They must consider them the true assets of the beloved country. The youth can be emerging as leaders, innovators, and change makers who are truly proud of their land, heritage, confident in their abilities, and rooted in values of compassion and empathy. Moon and Eagle: May the youth of our beloved country always shine brightly like a moon, and fly high like an eagle, as this bird has great traits and lives mostly in the air, stay at the peak of the mountains, and remain always in struggle and high grace. The great poet of the subcontinent, Allama Iqbal, used the word Shaheen symbolically for this king of the bird. May the young minds grow well, rock well, shine, and live with high grace.

The Tigers will open their season Monday at Howard in Washington D.C. As the weather turns colder, it becomes apparent that the most important season is upon us: basketball season. Mizzou men's basketball returns to the court Monday in Washington D.C. where it will play its season-opener against Howard. \"You want to galvanize your team,\" coach Dennis Gates said. \"There's no better way to do that than on the road. You get a sense of team building. You get a sense of camaraderie. You get to uproot them and then you have a slew of games where they're comfortable.\" Howard is the first of 13 non-conference teams the Tigers will face ahead of the Southeastern Conference opener against Florida on Jan. 3. Last season, the Bison finished 12-20 overall and 7-7 in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. One of their 12 losses was to the Tigers where  Mark Mitchell dropped 16 on the night and Anthony Robinson II had 13. Missouri won 77-62 on its home court, earning its first win of the season Nov. 8, 2024. This season, the Bison return only four players. Two of their main returners, graduate Bryce Harris and senior Ose Okojie, are coming off season-ending injuries. The veterans played in the matchup last year as Harris secured the second-most points that night for Howard with 11 points as Okojie ended with six. \"(Howard) returns a player of the year in Bryce Harris,\" Gates said. \"Unfortunately, he had an injury last season and couldn't compete. But, more importantly, he's back now, looking to return from their success.\" The Tigers will also have to watch out for the 12 new faces on the squad, with seven freshman padding the roster. Specifically, Missouri will need to pay attention to transfers Cam Gillus and Cedric Taylor III. The two juniors, alongside Harris, received preseason MEAC honors with Harris on First Team, Gillus on Second Team and Taylor on Third Team. \"They play a team game,\" Gates said, \"and I'm excited to put my team, our program, on the road against a great program and a great coach and great players, no different than the SEC would present the same problems and pose the same situation.\" Both Mizzou and Howard are coming off wins in their preseason exhibitions. The Tigers defeated Kansas State on Oct. 24, 100-91, while Howard took down American University on Tuesday, 77-63. Looking closer at the Tigers' roster after the exhibition, Gates did not confirm or deny if freshman Trent Burns would be ready to play in the season opener Monday after foot surgery earlier this year. Burns has been free of his boot since the exhibition, but more surprising was junior Trent Pierce standing, not in uniform, beside him. Pierce is also reportedly injured, according to Gates, and may not see the court against Howard. Another question mark for the Tigers is senior captain Mark Mitchell, who took a hard fall in the exhibition against the Wildcats in the first half. He did not play in the second. Pierce and Mitchell have been practicing, according to Gates, but their status is unknown for the season-opener. \"I'll dive into making a decision on who's available after I talk and meet with our trainer, but also meet with individual kids on how they're feeling,\" Gates said.

    "title": "Lincoln's Raley Cochran finishes as state runner up",
    "text": "Raley Cochran maintains her pace. Ona, W.Va. — A year after Lincoln’s Raley Cochran finished 11th at the state meet, it was her goal to finish even higher. Her strategy was simple. “My strategy was to not let anybody get too far away from me and kick it in at the end, see who I could get,” Cochran said. And she accomplished that, as she was the Class AA state runner-up (20:21.39) at the 2025 WVSACC State Cross Country Championships on Saturday at Cabell Midland. “It feels pretty great,” Cochran said. “I’ve been working at this a long time, so I just feel great. It’s great to finish that high.” Cochran was the leader after the first mile, and although she entered the Cabell Midland High School track — the final stretch of the race — in fourth place, she passed two more runners to place second. “To know Raley basically since she was born and how hard she works at everything, she has certainly put the work in, so as a sophomore to be the state runner up is quite an accomplishment for her and certainly says a lot to her work ethic and her family who supported her and her team who has supported her,” Lincoln coach Kevin Nuzum said. “We’re real proud of Raley and all of the girls, the whole team, today.” She was joined in the top 10 by one of her teammates, Adalynn Milnes, a freshman, who placed seventh in 21:06.53, a second or two away from her personal-best time. She’s the lone freshman on the girls team, and her top-10 finish is the first from a freshman in school history at the state meet. “It was very exciting,” Milnes said. “I was excited to make it there because there’s no other freshmen on the team, and I’m the No. 2 runner.” Cochran and Milnes and others helped the Lincoln girls cross country team finish third. They had the same score (71) as Braxton County, but the tie breaker went to the Eagles since their final runner finished higher than Lincoln’s. Buffalo placed fourth (84) and Williamstown placed fifth (114). Also placing in the top 20 and earning a medal was Doddridge County’s Kaitlyn Key, who placed 11th (21:41.84). A senior, it wasn’t her personal-best time overall, but it was her best time on this course. “I wanted to start off strong,” Key said. “I feel like I do best when I get out ahead and get out of the park. Once I got down the hill, I had a little less than a mile and I just gave it everything I got, started to kick off girls one by one.” Key was one of two Doddridge County girls who qualified for the state meet, as Emily Cottrill also medaled with her 20th-place finish (22:42.39). Also, Philip Barbour’s Kayla Baker, in her final high school cross country race, placed 15th (22:22.920, South Harrison’s Savannah Holden finished 22nd (22:53.04) and Zoe Kirksey finished 48th (25:00.81). Boys The Doddridge County boys cross country team won the Class AA championship as a team as they placed first with an overall team score of 60. Lincoln was the state runner-up with an overall score of 71. The rest of the top five included Frankfort (90), Tyler Consolidated (fourth, 123) and Williamstown (fifth, 131). “It’s nice, it’s nice,” Doddridge County coach Josh Weekley said. “We had one on the girls side that we should’ve gotten a couple of years ago and didn’t, so getting this one on the boys, we knew coming in that we should, but you always have to do it on the course and they did exactly like they’ve done all year long. They all placed right around where we thought they should, a couple of them even elevated. They did what they needed to do, they went out and performed.” Amos Kimble of Tyler Consolidated won the Class AA boys state championship in 16:32.76. The state runner-up was Frankfort’s Gavin McDonald (16:51.52), and his teammate, Eric Alexander, placed third (17:11.30). Tyler Consolidated’s Tyler Moore placed fifth. Carter Sias was the Bulldogs’ top finisher on the boys side as he placed fourth in 17:19.90. It tied his best finish from his freshman year when he also placed fourth. “I’m very happy with that,” Sias said. “It definitely brings a lot of joy that I was able to do that my senior year. I think I’m more focused on seeing if the team gets a title, because I love my team a lot and I would love a title with them. I think that’s what I’m paying attention to more with them.” Sias also finished ahead of another local runner who had placed often beaten throughout the season, most often by 15 or more seconds. “I had him (Sias) down for fifth, I figured that was probably where he’d end up because Travis Moore from Tyler Consolidated had beaten him (by) 15-20 seconds all year long,” Weekley said. “Boy, he really stepped up and ran a good one. He was in third there for a while, but held on to the fourth spot. It’s big, he was five spots ahead of Lincoln’s No. 1 guy. Samuel (Gola) was five spots ahead of Lincoln’s No. 2 guy, that’s 10 points right there. The best I can tell, we won by 11, 10 of it is right there on those front two guys, so that’s a great race by Samuel to race seventh, get on the podium.” Nearly all of the Bulldogs medaled, as Samuel Gola placed seventh (17:54.73), Cory Swentzel placed 14th (18:17.37), Colton Key placed 17th (18:23.63) and Noah Bodkin finished 18th (18:27.74). Last year, Gola placed in the low 30s as a freshman and 17th as a sophomore, and while Saturday’s race wasn’t his personal-best time overall, it was his personal-best time on the state course and finish at the state event. “It felt great to finally get in the top 10,” Gola said. “I’ve never been so happy. I’ve worked so hard for it, and I’m really happy that I was finally able to get it.” Also finishing for the Bulldogs was Jacob Berke (50th, 20:06.68) and Cayleb Amos (51st, 20:09.10). For Lincoln, Adrian Bott placed ninth (18:05.56) in the final race of his high school career, all despite slipping a little bit out of the gates. It was an improvement over his 21st-place finish last year, and he is the first Lincoln boy to earn first-team all-state honors at the state meet. ”It felt good,” Bott said. “I definitely wanted to go faster, get a better place, but I didn’t start good enough.” Lincoln had four runners earn a medal. Aiden Byers placed 12th (18:16.51), Max Myers placed 13th (18:16.59) and Carter Knight placed 15th (18:21.38). “I’m just real proud of our team,” Nuzum said. “I thought did great. For a program that we’ve been building that I’ve coached for 16 years, to make it to states for both teams, and to do as well as we did, everyone wants to win, but I’ll take state runner-up. And with these young girls being third, they’re going to get there, so I’m real proud of this team. We’ve stayed healthy, we’ve stayed focused, we’ve stayed together, and I’m real proud of them.” Others who ran for the Cougars on Saturday include Seth Nay (24th, 18:53.34), Jonathon Folmsbee (25th, 18:54.35) and Dennis Napper (68th, 20:48.73). In a year where it was Lincoln’s first year for both teams to qualify for the state meet, having the whole teams at the event made it even better, Myers said. “It was the best experience of my life,” Myers said. “I love my entire team. We have four or five Liberty transfers, and we came together like family all year long with one goal of getting to states and doing the best we can.” Also, Philip Barbour’s Jacob Burner placed 19th (18:33.53), South Harrison’s Brennen Myers finished 32nd (19:20.06) and Nathaniel Linger placed 46th (20:01.33).

    "title": "Scotland thrashes 85-0",
    "text": "Darcy Graham and Duhan van der Merwe continued their personal battle to top Scotland's try-scoring charts as they ran in several scores during an 85-0, 13-try, rout of the United States at Murrayfield on Saturday. Scotland were without several first-choice players for their Autumn Nations Series opener, including Sione Tuipulotu, Finn Russell, Blair Kinghorn, Zander Fagerson, and Pierre Schoeman. But they were still far too strong for the United States, a tier two rugby union nation, ahead of next week's far sterner challenge at home to New Zealand, with Scotland yet to beat the All Blacks in 32 matches spanning 117 years of Tests between the two countries. \"Straight away, the players were very cohesive which is hard to achieve in a week's training, with a brand new team.\" Scotland coach Gregor Townsend told the BBC. Looking ahead to the clash with New Zealand, the former Scotland playmaker added: \"It's a huge match. This game has been sold out for a while. Everyone loves watching the All Blacks. \"We've had two cracking matches against them (22-17 and 31-23 home defeats in 2017 and 2022) but not delivered that winning performance. \"There's no reason why we can't (beat New Zealand). The guys will be up for it and have the belief they can do it.\" South Africa-born Van der Merwe marked his 50th cap with a double to take his Scotland tally to 34 tries, but fellow Edinburgh wing Graham moved level with him as the Dark Blues' highest try-scorer of all time with a hat-trick. The writing was on the wall for the Eagles as early as the fifth minute when Dylan Richardson went over from close range. And two minutes later, 21-year-old debutant back-row Liam McConnell's run up the left was followed by a basketball pass to set up Van der Merwe. Graham scored Scotland's third try before Van der Merwe grabbed his second of the match, with Scotland 45-0 ahead at half-time in an utterly lopsided contest. The rout continued after the break, with Graham completing his hat-trick four minutes into the second half after an exchange of passes with Ollie Smith.

    "text": "Nov. 1—A pedestrian was killed by a suspected intoxicated driver in a hit-and-run collision on Thursday night, the Anchorage Police Department said. Anchorage police officers and Anchorage Fire Department medics were called to the area of Fireweed Lane and D Street at about 9:35 p.m., police said in an online statement. An SUV driven by someone later identified as 61-year-old John Ivory had collided with a pedestrian, police said. Online court records indicated that Ivory was charged with driving under the influence, a Class A misdemeanor. The pedestrian had been trying to cross Fireweed Lane west of Eide Street outside of a crosswalk when they were hit by Ivory's eastbound SUV, according to police. The pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene after life-saving measures were attempted, police said. Ivory left the scene but was arrested \"a short time later\" on suspicion of driving under the influence, according to police. Police reviewed traffic camera footage and tracked the SUV's movements before and after striking the female pedestrian, including a stretch where the vehicle was driven the wrong way down Northern Lights Boulevard, according to information from police included in charging documents signed by Assistant District Attorney Ashley D. McGraw. Traffic camera footage showed the vehicle being parked at the Walmart on A Street, where police located and apprehended the defendant, according to the charging documents. \"Clues\" during field testing led to officers' suspicions of the driver's impairment, while a breath sample was negative for alcohol, the charges said. The collision closed the westbound lanes of Fireweed Lane at D Street until about 3:30 a.m. Friday, police said. Police said Friday morning that the victim will be identified after next-of-kin notification procedures are complete.",

    "title": "Staff and parents voice concerns over proposed Anchorage school closures",
    "text": "Nov. 1—The Anchorage School District this week heard criticism from parents and staff from two elementary schools it proposes to close next school year. Many questioned whether closing schools would increase class sizes, and took issue with the repeated disruption of programs for special education students. Anchorage School Board members are weeks away from voting on the proposed closures, but say they still want feedback from the community. A survey is available on the district website, and another \"community conversation\" is planned for Saturday at the district office building from noon to 2 p.m. If school board members vote to approve the plan, charter schools would move into the vacated Fire Lake and Lake Otis elementary buildings. The board will discuss the school closures proposed by district administrators for the first time Tuesday, and take a final vote on Nov. 18. One board member, Pat Higgins, attended two district events this week to hear from parents and staff and said he doesn't support the current plan, though he said he did support district efforts to add child care to vacant classrooms. \"They feel strongly that it's going to hurt the kids, and it's not good for the community, and they oppose it. That's what I heard,\" Higgins said. \"I'm not a big supporter of closing these schools. I don't think the benefits outweigh the adverse impact it has on the community and the involvement with the family.\" District officials have argued that fewer school buildings are needed to serve a dwindling population of students. Compared to 2010, nearly 7,500 fewer students now attend neighborhood schools in the district. During that same time, the district has closed five schools. Deputy Chief of Schools Kersten Johnson-Struempler said underutilized schools are more susceptible to issues when one teacher has to call out sick, and closing schools will reduce the number of mixed-grade classrooms throughout the district. She told Lake Otis families who filed into the Bettye Davis East cafeteria on Wednesday that the plan attempts to use resources more efficiently by concentrating them at a smaller number of school buildings. [Alaska educators call for more school funding in second task force meeting] \"We are looking at low utilization rates. The reason we're here, unfortunately, is partially budget-related, but partially enrollment decline,\" Johnson-Struempler said. \"We as a district really do have to consider what is our utilization rate, how are we using our money as a district most effectively, and so that's a factor.\" Special education concerns Lake Otis Elementary staff and parents questioned the district's plan to relocate students in special education classes. The distribution of Lake Otis students to other schools will also have a ripple effect on those programs. To make room for general education students moving from Lake Otis to Kasuun Elementary, students in the School Based Behavioral Supports program at Kasuun would relocate to Ocean View Elementary under the current plan. Kasuun special education behavior coach Chandra Binion is concerned that the sensory deprivation room at Kasuun may not be available for students who need it if they relocate to Ocean View. \"We have some students who came to us from Lake Hood after it closed. If we are moved to Ocean View, this will be their third location in three years. Our kids in our program thrive on consistency, stability, and that's what they need and this move feels like it's taking that away from them,\" Binion said. \"We deal with students who are often in crisis, and you can't keep moving them around like that if we want them to be successful.\" During Johnson-Struempler's presentation detailing where special education students would be moved, she also noted the importance of routine for special education students. \"We do want to really pay attention for all students to the number of transitions they have, but particularly for our special education students in special programs,\" she said. \"Having consistency and limiting the transitions is something we really look at.\" Jacqui Higgins, who chairs the district's Special Education Advisory Committee, said her child has made significant progress with their Life Skills teacher at Lake Otis. \"We spent a long time building this community, and I think it is unacceptable that the Anchorage School District thinks that it is OK to be so transient with their special education students,\" Higgins said. Higgins is worried that her child might regress next school year without familiar teachers. Higgins is also concerned about the impacts on her child of a longer bus ride with more students. Despite her reservations, she doesn't oppose the district's right-sizing effort altogether. \"I'm OK with right-sizing. We are losing people, our infrastructure is not built the way it used to be,\" Higgins said. At a school board meeting last week, Fire Lake parents also voiced concerns about special education programs. Special education students in the school's resource and structured learning classroom programs would relocate to Birchwood ABC school. Students in the Life Skills program at Birchwood would move to Alpenglow Elementary. \"There's a true family built around that entire SPED program. Those children belong in a way that I can't imagine replicated in another facility,\" parent Arielle Van Vleet said. Binion, the Kasuun special education teacher, said she hadn't heard satisfactory answers about her concerns after speaking with several board members and district staff Wednesday. \"It's all kind of on how the board votes. We're very, very concerned,\" Binion said. More feedback In addition to the meeting Wednesday, board member Kelly Lessens said she attended meetings this week with Indigenous, multicultural and special education advisory committees, as well as some middle school parents. Lessens heard several parents asking if school closures would increase class sizes at the schools receiving those students. Lessens said that's a misconception. \"It's not correct for people to say that school consolidations are going to increase their class sizes,\" Lessens said. \"What is true is that insufficient funds for supporting and maintaining public education are responsible for increased class sizes.\" For Fire Lake, one topic that parents also bring up is a nearby housing development currently under construction, which will add more than 100 homes to the neighborhood. District officials have said the development is not likely to significantly affect the projected enrollment. Fire Lake was initially included in the list of schools planned for closure last year, but board members voted to remove it from consideration. \"We went through this last year, and every reason remains the same for why Fire Lake should remain open, and I cannot for the life of me understand how we're back here when nothing has changed. The only thing that has changed is that the development being built is further along than it was a year ago,\" Fire Lake parent Van Vleet said. Board members encouraged residents to continue voicing their concerns to the district. Families and other community members can take the district survey or testify at board meetings on Nov. 4 and Nov. 18. Board member Andy Holleman said he's typically accustomed to hearing complaints from parents when the district asks for feedback, but this week was different. \"When you go to these, people stand up and talk about how wonderful this school is and how it's the only place that really gets their kid, and they're not going to be able to do as well anywhere else,\" Holleman said, \"which is how we want everybody to feel about their schools. But at the same time, we just have too many buildings for the number of kids we're serving and this is going to be a tough choice.\"",

    "text": "James Gilbert/Getty Images ShareThis is disabled until you accept Social Networking cookies. Denny Hamlin will begin his NASCAR Cup Series championship quest from the pole Sunday afternoon at Phoenix Raceway. Hamlin topped the board in the final qualifying session of the 2025 season with a lap of 133.759mph (26.914s) – his fifth pole of the year and fourth at Phoenix. “We’re trying; we’re doing everything we can,” he said of winning the championship. “I’m really proud of this whole Progressive Toyota team. We’ve worked hard on it. We’ve really been working hard, and hopefully we get the payoff tomorrow.” William Byron and Kyle Larson, two of the three other Cup Series title contenders, qualified second and third. Byron clocked in at 133.551mph; Larson’s fast lap was 133.437mph. Austin Cindric qualified fourth at 133.249mph, Ryan Blaney fifth at 133.190mph, Carson Hocevar sixth at 133.141mph, Josh Berry seventh at 132.876mph, Alex Bowman eighth at 132.871mph, Chris Buescher ninth at 132.787mph and Joey Logano tenth at 132.748mph. Chase Briscoe, the fourth championship contender, qualified 12th (132.680mph). All four teams in the title hunt will have the pick of pit stall selections before the rest of the field. It will follow the order of qualifying, with Hamlin’s team picking their stall first, followed by Byron, Larson and Briscoe. “We’re obviously going to be in a great starting spot there at this point,” Hamlin said. “Then we have to make sure we do all the right things, and that’s execute the entire day. Largely, that’s going to rest on my shoulders, so I’ll do the best I can.” AJ Allmendinger was the only driver who did not post a qualifying time. Allmendinger crashed during Friday’s practice session because of a tire issue, and his Kaulig Racing team is preparing the backup car for Sunday’s finale. There will be 38 teams that take the green flag on Sunday afternoon. NEXT: The Cup Series championship finale at 3 p.m. ET Sunday.

    "text": "Police operate near the scene after a series of stabbings on a train near Cambridge, Britain, November 1, 2025, in this screengrab from video obtained from social media. JAMIE SHAND/via REUTERS LONDON (Reuters) -Nine people were treated for life-threatening injuries after a series of stabbings on a train near Cambridge in eastern England on Saturday, and two men were arrested in what Prime Minister Keir Starmer called an \"appalling incident.\" British Transport Police said counterterrorism police were supporting its investigation whilst it works to establish the full circumstances and motivation for the incident. “We’re conducting urgent enquiries to establish what has happened, and it could take some time before we are in a position to confirm anything further,\" British Transport Police Chief Superintendent Chris Casey said. \"At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident.\" Cambridgeshire police said they were called at 1939 GMT after reports that multiple people had been stabbed on the 1825 service from Doncaster in northern England to London King's Cross. The train stopped at Huntingdon, with armed officers seen entering the train in videos on social media. \"Armed officers attended and the train was stopped at Huntingdon, where two men were arrested,\" the police said. One eyewitness told Sky News that one of the suspects, waving a large knife, was tasered by police. The East of England Ambulance Service said it mobilised a large-scale response to Huntingdon Railway Station, which included numerous ambulances and critical care teams, including three air ambulances. Starmer posted on X that the incident was \"deeply concerning.\" \"My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response,\" he said.

    "title": "Ireland crumble after the break as ruthless All Blacks turn the screw",
    "text": "This time, Chicago was not Ireland’s kind of town. Unlike 2016, when they made history and transformed this fixture from a one-sided slaughter into a genuine rivalry, Ireland didn’t get things their own way. They had their moments, for sure. In fact, they even survived 20 minutes with a numerical disadvantage in the first half, holding the lead up until the hour mark. And then came that familiar meltdown which had characterised the first 111 years of this fixture. As New Zealand clicked up through the gears, Ireland went into reverse. First came a try from Tamaiti Williams on 61 minutes — New Zealand opting for a tap and go when a more conservative team might have kicked for the posts. That edged them a point in front. But they were only getting started. Next, on 67 minutes, came Wallace Sititi’s score — a superb flowing move from New Zealand’s perspective, a defensive disaster from Ireland’s. Garry Ringrose was exposed, Beauden Barrett and Damian McKenzie were brilliant, and Sititi finished off the move to make it 21–13 to New Zealand. And then, three minutes from the end, scrum-half Cam Roigard slalomed his way through a forest of Irish defenders to put the game beyond reach. Who would have thought that possible at half-time? Because at that stage, Ireland were ahead. Given they had played much of the first half with just 14 players, it was a superb opening 40 minutes. There were flaws — Jack Crowley overhitting several kicks, Dan Sheehan miscuing a few throws — but few teams ever dictate terms against New Zealand. Ireland did in that first period. For starters, there was a seventh-minute penalty from Crowley to make it 3–0. Ten minutes later came an inspired call by captain Dan Sheehan to go for the corner rather than the posts. Fortune favoured the brave. Sheehan, Ryan Baird, Sheehan again, then Jamison Gibson-Park and Stuart McCloskey combined to set up Tadhg Furlong, who barged across from close range. Try, Ireland. Crowley converted, and the lead stretched to 10–0. It didn’t last long. Will Jordan reminded everyone why “Jordan” is a name that resonates in Chicago. The New Zealand full-back swept through the Irish midfield on 19 minutes, and by the time the cover defence scrambled back, the ball was zipped right for Ardie Savea to touch down. Beauden Barrett converted. 10–7. It stayed that way until half-time. With James Ryan off for a HIA and Tadhg Beirne gone for the rest of the game, Ireland had neither of their starting locks on the field by the break. You could say they were stuck between a lock and a hard place. And yet, they still led. Pre-match, the PA man had played a Phil Collins song to gee everyone up. Then, against all odds, Ireland led New Zealand at the break. But after losing here in 2016, all New Zealand wanted was one more night in Soldier Field. They got it here — and they got a performance, too. By the second half, their scrum had solidified, their aerial game steadied, and their handling sharpened. Those three second-half tries owed everything to their ability to execute when it mattered. Few teams in the world can do that. Ireland, in 2022 and 2023, were one of those teams at that level. Now, they are not. This was proof — a team in transition, still missing Johnny Sexton, with neither Crowley nor Sam Prendergast quite there yet. In the end, they ran out of steam. Those 20 minutes without Tadhg Beirne, sent off for a high tackle on Beauden Barrett, proved crucial. Playing New Zealand is tough enough when it’s 15 versus 15. Make it 15 versus 14, even for 20 minutes, and you will suffer. It took a while for that disadvantage to catch up with Ireland. But it did. The All Blacks played like all backs — their handling slick, Ireland’s less so. Chicago belongs to them this time.",

    "text": "Mohamed Salah and Ryan Gravenberch net as holders Liverpool beat Villa to end their four-game Premier League losing run. Published On 1 Nov 20251 Nov 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Liverpool finally halted their dreadful losing run with a 2-0 Premier League victory over Aston Villa on Saturday to climb into third place in the table, as Mohamed Salah became the third player in Reds history to score 250 goals. Under mounting pressure after four successive league losses – and six in their last seven games across all competitions – Arne Slot’s men climbed to within seven points of league leaders Arsenal, with 18 points. Villa fell to 11th in the table on 15 points. list of 4 itemsend of list Salah struck in first-half injury time, capitalising on a huge blunder from Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who played the ball right into the path of Liverpool’s talisman. Salah finished first time to the relief of the anxious Anfield crowd, and joined Roger Hunt and Ian Rush as the only players to score 250 goals for the Merseyside club. Ryan Gravenberch doubled the home side’s lead in the 58th minute when he blasted a shot from the top of the box that deflected off Pau Torres and in, past Martinez. A stunning volley from Amad Diallo earned Manchester United a battling 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Saturday. Looking to continue their revival under Ruben Amorim, United appeared to be on their way to securing a fourth successive league victory after Brazilian veteran Casemiro headed them into a 34th-minute lead. United, however, capitulated early in the second half, when two goals in less than two minutes from Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona helped Forest to turn the match on its head. The visitors responded well, but were frustrated in their efforts to restore parity until Diallo unleashed a blistering strike from the edge of the penalty area nine minutes from time to secure a point for Amorim’s side. Diallo almost snatched victory at the death, as United missed the chance to climb up to second in the standings with a win, the point helping them to move into fifth in the standings, above rivals Manchester City, who play on Sunday. Forest stay 18th. Arsenal moved seven points clear at the top of the Premier League with a straightforward 2-0 victory over Burnley at Turf Moor, as their mastery of set pieces again proved irresistible. Viktor Gyokeres opened the scoring in the 14th minute from yet another corner routine involving Declan Rice and Gabriel, with the Swede touching in from close range. Arsenal were in cruise control in the 35th minute, this time from open play, as a sweeping counterattack ended with Rice thumping a header past Burnley goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. Burnley did not manage a goal attempt in the first half, and while they offered more of a threat after the break, Arsenal eased to a seventh consecutive clean sheet in all competitions. Arsenal have 25 points from 10 games, with Bournemouth, who play on Sunday, second on 18. Burnley are 17th with 10 points. Source link",

    "title": "NYT Pips Hints, Walkthrough And Solutions For Sunday, November 2",
    "text": "ByErik Kain, Senior Contributor. If you’re looking for help with today’s NYT Pips puzzle, look no further! Below, you’ll find the solutions for the Easy and Medium-tier Pips and a full walkthrough for the Hard Pips. It’s another beautiful day in November, so be sure to get out there and enjoy it before chillier weather descends. Winter is coming. Let’s solve this Pips! Looking for Friday’s Pips? Read our guide right here. In Pips, you have a grid of multicolored boxes. Each colored area represents a different “condition” that you have to achieve. You have a select number of dominoes that you have to spend filling in the grid. You must use every domino and achieve every condition properly to win. There are Easy, Medium and Difficult tiers. Here’s an example of a difficult tier Pips: As you can see, the grid has a bunch of symbols and numbers with each color. On the far left, the three purple squares must not equal one another (hence the equal sign crossed out). The two pink squares next to that must equal a total of 0. The zig-zagging blue squares all must equal one another. You click on dominoes to rotate them, and will need to since they have to be rotated to fit where they belong. Not shown on this grid are other conditions, such as “less than” or “greater than.” If there are multiple tiles with > or < signs, the total of those tiles must be greater or less than the listed number. It varies by grid. Blank spaces can have anything. The various possible conditions are: In order to win, you have to use up all your dominoes by filling in all the squares, making sure to fit each condition. Sometimes there’s only one way to solve the puzzle. Other times, there can be two or more different solutions. Play today’s Pips puzzle here. Below are the solutions for the Easy and Medium tier Pips. After that, I’ll walk you through the Hard puzzle. Spoilers ahead. Here’s today’s Hard Pips: Not a dog, not a spaceship — today’s Hard Pips is a happy little dancing man. Look at him dancing, making his TikTok videos. He’s just a little guy. We have several places we could theoretically start here. Any of the little man’s limbs would work, or even his head. These are mostly smaller groups or single tiles, but there’s one big Blue = group in the middle. Based on our dominoes, that will need to be 1’s, so we can kind of look ahead and see what dominoes we have with 1’s and what the other sides of those are to guide us. Notably, there are no free tiles in today’s Pips, which is unusual. I started by looking at the little man’s right foot and leg but decided there were too many possibilities. The left was better, since Green 12 has to be comprised of two 6’s. I placed the 5/6 domino from Pink > 4 into Green 12 and the 6/0 domino from Green 12 into Pink 0. Next, I placed the 0/5 domino from Pink 0 into Orange 10. I finished up the Pink 0 group with the 0/1 domino into Blue = and placed it horizontally, since you can tell you need to leave the space above empty. Next, I placed the 0/3 domino from Purple 0 into Dark Blue 6 and the 3/1 domino from Dark Blue 6 into the big Blue = group. Then I placed the 5/1 domino from Orange 10 up into Blue = and the 1/1 domino in the center of the Blue = group. Time for the remaining limbs. I placed the 6/4 domino from Blue > 4 into Purple 8 and the 4/2 domino from Purple 8 into the Dark Blue 2 tile. Then I placed the 3/2 domino from Orange 3 into Green 8 and the 6/1 tile from Green 8 into the Blue = group. With just the little man’s head remaining, I placed the 1/4 domino from Blue = into Pink 8 and the 0/4 domino from the Purple 0 tile into Pink 8. Now the happy dancing man is complete! This Pips was a lot more daunting than it was challenging. Lots of small total groups that could be solved different ways, but pretty obvious clues on where to go right off the bat. Starting where I did helped, I think, because it was pretty clear that the 6/0 would go into Pink 0 and the rest of that group led me straight to where I needed to go next. Still fun, just not nearly as hard as yesterday’s. Let me know if you solved this a different way on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook.

    "text": "As our own Doug Powers reported a couple of days ago, Omar Fateh, the mayoral candidate known as the \"Mamdani of Minneapolis,\" pledged his loyalty to the country … of Somalia. Fateh waved the Somali flag at a campaign rally and pledged loyalty to the country, despite the fact that he was born in Washington, D.C. Omar Fateh waves foreign flag, speaks a foreign language, pledges his loyalty to Somalia, tells Somalians to elect himThis is a rally in Minneapolis pic.twitter.com/uVP4k8TVcK It was a nice concession of Fateh to have an American flag behind him. We know that Minneapolis is Little Somalia, but it looks like Columbus, Ohio, is moving in the same direction. We're not sure why this woman is urging children who are too young to vote to get out and vote, but she assures them, \"We believe in Somalia.\" The Associated Press just a couple of weeks ago published a feature about Somali Americans running for office. \"It’s a busy Friday afternoon at a Somali restaurant on the northeast side of Columbus, home to the second-largest Somali population in the United States. The smell of spices is just as robust as the loud conversation, and the East African restaurant is crowded after afternoon prayers at the nearby mosque.\" \"WE BELIEVE IN SOMALIA\" This is a rally for a candidate in… Columbus, Ohio pic.twitter.com/nrninMBeSh The two little girls up front are even dressed as the Somali flag. “We believe in Somalia”.Awesome, then go back there and make your own country better. Invasions by invitation are a real issue I believe in Somalia so much I want it to have its missing Somalians back. I believe in sending them back there Then return to Somalia. Take Ilhan Omar with you. They do know where they are.. right? I believe in Somalians going back to Somalia Upon taking office, you have to swear that you hold no allegiance or loyalty to any other country but the United States.Which means this kind of rhetoric disqualifies them by default. Thought that was the Minnesota flag for a second It was just a couple of years ago that Minnesota changed its \"offensive\" state flag to one that looks a lot like the Somali flag. Coming soon to a town/city near you Matt Walsh posted a hard truth on Friday: We should have never allowed immigration from Somalia at all. It has not benefited this country in the slightest way. Now they are taking over once-proud American cities, and will turn them into the same kind of failed dysfunctional hellscape that they fled. https://t.co/wxyUbdfBPj Like they say, import the third world, become the third world. *** Editor’s Note: The Schumer Shutdown is here.

    "title": "Disney Channels Vanish From YouTube TV After Contract Dispute",
    "text": "YouTube TV subscribers — including thousands across North Texas — lost access to ESPN, ABC, National Geographic, and over a dozen other Disney-owned channels after the companies failed to reach a new distribution deal. The blackout, which began late Thursday, affects major sports coverage, including college football games on Saturday and upcoming NBA, NFL, and NHL contests. YouTube TV, the largest U.S. internet TV provider with more than 9 million subscribers, warned viewers of the dispute for weeks through on-screen messages. YouTube TV’s parent company, Google, said Disney demanded higher fees that would drive up prices for subscribers. In a blog post updated just before midnight, YouTube accused Disney of yanking its channels to steer viewers toward its own streaming services, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo. “We know this is a frustrating and disappointing outcome for our subscribers and we continue to urge Disney to work with us constructively to reach a fair agreement that restores their networks to YouTube TV,” the company said, the Associated Press reported. YouTube TV said it will credit subscribers $20 if Disney content stays dark for an extended period. The service’s base plan costs $82.99 per month. Disney countered that YouTube TV refused to “pay fair rates” and accused the company of “using its market dominance to eliminate competition,” according to Axios. “With a $3 trillion market cap, Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we’ve successfully negotiated with every other distributor,” Disney said in a statement, AP reported. Disney emphasized that major college football matchups — including several Top 25 teams — will be affected this weekend, adding that it hopes to reach a resolution quickly. The dispute marks the fourth major content standoff for YouTube TV since August. The service has faced similar threats from Fox Corp. and NBCUniversal and remains at an impasse with TelevisaUnivision. One reported sticking point involves whether Disney would allow YouTube TV to distribute its streaming content within the platform — a concession Disney has little incentive to grant as it builds its own services. YouTube is also considering a separate sports and broadcast package. Unlike traditional cable providers, virtual pay-TV services face fewer regulations — giving YouTube TV flexibility to push for cheaper, more modern streaming deals.",

    "title": "Roast potatoes will be crispy every time when you add 1 thing at boiling stage",
    "text": "Roast potatoes are a quintessential part of a traditional roast dinner. We Brits are mad about roast potatoes, and there's always a bit of a debate over the best recipe to get that perfect crispy exterior while keeping the inside fluffy. You might have been taught that potatoes should only ever be cooked in a specific type of fat, or you may firmly believe the way they're moved from boiling to roasting is crucial. The reality is, there are countless ways to roast a potato, and if your preferred method results in tasty spuds, then you're not doing anything wrong. However, if you're on the hunt for a foolproof way to ensure crispy potatoes every time, one culinary enthusiast on social media may just have the ideal trick. All you need to do is add one ingredient to the water during the boiling process. In an Instagram video, Oryan Levi revealed her secret tip for perfect roast potatoes. She mentioned her mates often ask her for the recipe, and she gets her perfect crisp by adding a common kitchen cupboard item to her boiling water. Oryan began by saying she was using baby potatoes instead of larger ones, and she halved them but left the skins on. This trick could still work with regular potatoes typically used for roasting, but the secret ingredient is intended to crisp up the skins so it might not be as effective on peeled potatoes. She then put them all into a pot and added some water, along with the secret ingredient - baking soda. She advised: \"A tablespoon of baking soda in the water is going to help make the skin super crispy.\" Oryan then proceeded with the usual cooking process, removing the potatoes from the water once they were \"fork tender\". After draining them in a colander, she emphasised the \"most important part of the process\" was letting them sit in the colander for at least 10 minutes to allow all the excess water to evaporate. Next, Oryan seasoned the potatoes with garlic, salt, pepper, and oil, before spreading them out on a baking tray. She then positioned each potato cut side down and baked them in the oven for 15-20 minutes at 220°C - resulting in perfectly cooked and crispy potatoes. In the caption of her post, she wrote: \"My biggest tip with this recipe is to get to know your oven well. Does it run hot? Are there hot spots where food tends to get extra crispy? There's a delicate balance between perfectly golden and too far gone. The first time you make this, keep a close eye and check on your taters often to make sure they don't burn!\" 1. Choose the right potato:Go for starchy potatoes like Russets or Maris Piper. They crisp up better than waxy varieties. 2. Cut evenly:Cut your potatoes into similar-sized chunks so they cook evenly. Larger chunks give a fluffy inside; smaller ones get crispier. 3. Parboil First:Boil the potatoes in salted water for 7-10 minutes until just tender (they should be soft on the outside but not falling apart). This helps create a fluffy exterior. 4. Rough them up:Drain the potatoes and give them a good shake in the colander or pan to rough up the edges. These rough bits become extra crispy. 5. Preheat the fat:While the potatoes are parboiling, preheat your roasting pan with oil or fat (vegetable oil, duck/goose fat, or beef dripping) in a hot oven (220°C/425°F). Adding potatoes to hot fat ensures instant sizzle and crispiness. 6. Don't crowd the pan:Spread the potatoes out in a single layer with space between them. Overcrowding steams them instead of roasting. 7. Season well:Toss with salt, pepper, and any desired herbs (rosemary, thyme, garlic cloves) before roasting. 8. Roast and turn:Roast for 40-50 minutes, turning once or twice for even browning. Don't turn too often - let them crisp up! 9. Finish with a sprinkle:For extra crunch, sprinkle with a little coarse salt or a dusting of semolina/flour before roasting. 10. Serve immediately:Crispy potatoes are best served right out of the oven!",

    "text": "Written by Muskan Gupta |Published : November 2, 2025 1:33 PM IST Dry mouth, also known as xerostomia, is more common than most people realise. It might be not only a slight pain in its essence but also indicate a health complication, say dentists. It occurs as a result of the inability of the salivary glands in your mouth to produce just enough saliva to keep your mouth moist. Salivation is important in the preservation of oral health, and the absence of salivation may cause a number of dental and health issues. Dry mouth refers to a condition that experiences an abnormally dry mouth because of lack of sufficient saliva. Saliva assists in cleaning the food particles as well as neutralising acids and bacteria. The mouth is susceptible to infections, cavities, and even bad breath when the level of saliva reduces. This condition is either a temporary one, as may happen upon intake of some drugs, or it may be chronic, as may be associated with health complications or interventions.\n\nAlso Read\nOral Health: From Cavities To Gingivitis, 5 Dental Diseases And How To Prevent ThemCan Bad Oral Hygiene Increase Heart Attack Risk?

Dry mouth's common causes include: Dry mouth is hard to miss, in the event that you are aware of it. The common symptoms include: In case of these symptoms taking more than a few days, then it is worthy of visiting a dentist in order to have an evaluation.\n \nYou may like to read There is always a shortage of saliva, which can cause severe problems with the mouth. Saliva plays key roles in the cleaning of food in the mouth and breaking down the acids that are produced by the bacteria. Lack of sufficient amounts of it leads to a higher rate of accumulated plaque that puts individuals at risk of tooth decay, gum disease and mouth infections. In extreme cases, it may also contribute to taste as well as render the use of dentures painful. See your dentist in case you always feel dry or you eat and speak with difficulty. Chronic dry mouth can be an indication of some underlying condition that requires medical intervention. One can avoid cavities by taking care of their mouth at an early age.\n\nTRENDING NOW Dry mouth might appear to be a minor takeaway, yet dentists say that this symptom should not be overlooked at all. The mouth requires a healthy flow of saliva; hence, one should listen to what the body is telling you.

    "title": "IPL 2026 Trade Window: BIG TWIST Ahead of Auction! Sanju Samson and KL Rahul’s Trade Makes A Massive U-Turn – Know Full Details",
    "text": "---Advertisement--- IPL 2026 Trade Window: The IPL 2026 trade window is already buzzing with speculation, and all eyes are on two of India’s top batsmen. Rumours are swirling that KL Rahul and Sanju Samson could be sporting new jerseys ahead of the upcoming season, potentially shaking up team dynamics across the league. Reports suggest that the Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals are close to finalizing a high-profile trade. If confirmed, Sanju Samson could move to Delhi in exchange for Tristan Stubbs. This swap would be among the biggest in recent IPL history, with Samson bringing leadership experience and consistent run-scoring to a Delhi lineup that is looking to strengthen its batting core. Delhi fans could see a significant boost if Samson dons their jersey in IPL 2026. 🚨 TRANSFER BOMBSHELL! 🚨Sanju Samson ➡️ Delhi Capitals on the cards ahead of IPL 2026 👀💥If this happens — it’s gonna shake the entire IPL trade window! 🔥#SanjuSamson #DelhiCapitals #IPL2026 #IPLRumours pic.twitter.com/C3BmBGXtEI Meanwhile, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are reportedly eyeing KL Rahul as they look to bounce back after a disappointing 2025 season. The Knight Riders are in need of a proven batter who can also take on leadership responsibilities. Rahul, who has captained Punjab and Lucknow, fits the bill perfectly. His strong relationship with KKR’s new coach, Abhishek Nayar, adds extra appeal for the franchise. However, KKR faces a tricky challenge. Building an attractive trade deal for Delhi won’t be easy. The Knight Riders are reluctant to part with key players like Rinku Singh or Angkrish Raghuvanshi, and veterans Andre Russell and Sunil Narine are untouchable. This limits their elite trade options, making the potential acquisition of Rahul a complex puzzle. 🚨 KKR WANTS KL RAHUL 🚨– KKR is desperate to have KL Rahul in their team but biggest question is that which player they will trade. [Sahil Malhotra from TOI] pic.twitter.com/8RoWLOgZOx Sources also indicate that KKR is preparing to make a big push for Cameron Green in the upcoming IPL auction. This suggests the franchise is planning a major rebuild around a fresh core of players. With both Rahul and Samson potentially on the move, the IPL 2026 trade window could dramatically alter team compositions, making the next season one of the most exciting yet. Fans can expect a period of intense speculation and high-stakes negotiations as franchises look to fine-tune their squads. The coming weeks could see some blockbuster deals that change the balance of power in the IPL.

Earlier on Day 3, India A finished at 119-4 in 39 overs, needing 156 runs to win with six wickets in hand. Pant and Badoni stitched a 53-run stand before the visitors dismissed the in-form wicketkeeper-batter. Pant looked set on the crease as he took his previous day’s score of 64 not out to enter the nervous nineties. However, Tiaan van Vuuren struck in the 49th over to dismiss Pant on 90, thereby reducing the hosts to 172/5 in their chase of 275 runs. Badoni and Kotian then carried the game forward, but the former was dismissed, scoring a 47-ball 34, as van Vuuren struck again in the 53rd over, putting an end to their 23-run sixth-wicket stand. While Kotian looked to settle in quickly, a poor choice of shot led to him being caught at fine leg as Lutho Sipamla provided his side with another breakthrough, bringing the Indian side down to 215/7 in 89 overs.

Van Vuuren has been the pick of the bowlers for the Proteas, having picked up three wickets in his nine-over spell so far while conceding 40 runs.

He remarked while reacting to the arrest of Anant Singh, former Mokama MLA, who is in the fray as the candidate of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U). \"It was bound to happen, such a serious incident had taken place\", said Yadav, referring to the arrest of Singh, in connection with the killing of Dular Chand Yadav, who was supporting Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj Party in that area. The young leader added, \"Today, the Prime Minister is visiting Bihar. He should take note of the situation in the state where not a day passes without some heinous crime taking place.

    "text": "LAWRENCE — Central Catholic High School senior and Lowell resident Mason Crowley, Class of 2026, was recently named a semifinalist by the 2026 National Merit Scholarship Program. CCHS Principal Andrew Murray presented Mason with a letter of acknowledgement for his academic accomplishments. “The entire Central Catholic community is beyond proud of the academic success of Mason,” said Murray. “We are confident that he will move on to amazing accomplishments and make the CCHS legacy even stronger.” According to NMSC, about 16,000 entrants were named semifinalists — the highest-scoring entrants in each state. The students were notified through their schools and provided scholarship application materials explaining requirements to advance in the competition for National Merit Scholarships to be offered in 2027. In addition to academics, Mason — who wants to pursue a degree in engineering or computer science — participates in several activities including Track & Field, National Honor Society, Student Alumni Association, and Student Ambassador Association. Mason also makes time to serve others: “My favorite service event is the Student Alumni Association Christmas Wrapping event, because it’s a great opportunity for us as students to get together and to give to those in need. I have also helped with the TeamWalk for Cancer Care in Lowell, the Haverhill Golf Tournament, the Special Olympics Field Games, and mentoring at Saint Mary’s Church.” Mason believes all his CCHS teachers have been supportive, but he has specific faculty shout-outs including Sully Grella ’92 (math faculty/coach), Brian Griffin (science faculty), Eric Boucher ’04 (math faculty), Cameron Hebert ’17 (math faculty). “I feel that what makes Central Catholic so special is definitely the sense of community. Everyone makes such a sincere effort to welcome and understand each other, and it makes a huge difference,” said Mason. Mason’s sister Makayla Crowley ’29 and cousins Elena Zorbas ’27 and Luke Zorbas ’27 also attend CCHS.",

    "title": "AI song generator Udio offers brief window for downloads after Universal settlement upsets users",
    "text": "Artificial intelligence song generation platform Udio said it would give its frustrated users 48 hours starting Monday to download their songs before the company shifts to a new business model to comply with a legal settlement. The short reprieve comes after Udio on Wednesday said it had settled copyright infringement claims brought by Universal Music, a label with artists including Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, Drake and Kendrick Lamar. AI companies are now fighting so many copyright lawsuits that a tech industry lobby group, the Chamber of Progress, last week called on President Donald Trump to sign an executive order directing federal attorneys \"to intervene in legal cases\" to defend the industry's practice of building generative AI tools by feeding them on copyrighted works. Citing more than 50 pending federal cases, the group asked for help stopping court fights leading to \"potentially company-killing penalties\" that threaten AI innovation. But artists have warned that AI tools built on their works also threaten their livelihoods. In the biggest settlement so far, AI company Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion — or $3,000 per book — to settle claims from authors who alleged the company illegally pirated nearly half a million of their works to train its chatbot. Udio and Universal didn't disclose the financial terms of their new music licensing agreements. They also said they will team up on a new streaming platform. As part of the agreement, Udio immediately stopped allowing people to download songs they've created, which sparked a backlash and apparent exodus among paying users. \"We know the pain it causes to you,\" Udio later said in a post on Reddit's Udio forum, where users were venting about feeling betrayed by the platform's surprise move and complained that it limited what they could do with their music. Udio said it still must stop downloads as it transitions to a new streaming platform next year. But over the weekend, it said it will give people 48 hours starting at 11 a.m. Eastern time Monday to keep their \"past creations.\" \"Udio is a small company operating in an incredibly complex and evolving space, and we believe that partnering directly with artists and songwriters is the way forward,\" said Udio's post. The settlement deal was the music industry's first since Universal, along with Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Records, sued Udio and another AI song generator, Suno, last year over copyright infringement. Udio and Suno pioneered AI song generation technology, which can spit out new songs based on prompts typed into a chatbot-style text box. Users, who don't need musical talent, can merely request a tune in the style of, for example, classic rock, 1980s synth-pop or West Coast rap. Record labels have accused the platforms of exploiting the recorded works of artists without compensating them. In its lawsuit filed against Udio last year, Universal sought to show how specific AI-generated songs made on Udio closely resembled Universal-owned classics like Frank Sinatra's \"My Way,\" The Temptations' \"My Girl,\" ABBA's \"Dancing Queen\" and holiday favorites like \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" and \"Jingle Bell Rock.\" A musician-led group, the Artist Rights Alliance, said Friday that the Universal-Udio settlement represents a positive step in creating a \"legitimate AI marketplace\" but raised questions about whether independent artists, session musicians and songwriters will be sufficiently protected from AI practices that present an \"existential threat\" to their careers. \"Licensing is the only version of AI's future that doesn't result in the mass destruction of art and culture,\" the group said. \"But this promise must be available to all music creators, not just to major corporate copyright holders.\"",

    "text": "Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis has vowed to help fund medical care for any fan involved in the Huntingdon train knife attack. Picture: Cameron Smith/Getty Images Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis has vowed to help fund medical care for any fan involved in the Huntingdon train knife attack after a season-ticket holder suffered serious injuries protecting a young girl. British Transport Police (BTP) said two people remain in a life-threatening condition, with a further nine treated in hospital, following the bloody rampage on a high-speed train on Saturday evening. One of those involved in the incident was a Forest season-ticket holder, who suffered serious injuries in the process of protecting a young girl during the attack, PA understands. The exact nature of the man's injuries or current condition is not known. Marinakis has said he will fund medical care for any Forest fan injured in the horrific incident. \"Everyone at Nottingham Forest is shocked and deeply saddened by what happened,\" the Greek businessman said in a club statement. \"The courage and selflessness shown by our supporters on that train represents the very best of humanity and the very best of our club's community. \"We will make sure any supporter caught up in this incident receives whatever financial support they require to enable them to access the best possible medical care as they recover. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected.\" A number of Forest fans were returning to London on the train after watching the 2-2 draw with Manchester United - a result ending a run of four successive league defeats. The club added: \"Nottingham Forest Football Club wishes to express its deepest concern and heartfelt sympathy to all those affected by the shocking attack on an LNER train bound for London yesterday evening. \"Many of our London-based supporters were travelling home on that train following our match at the City Ground, and our thoughts are very much with everyone caught up in such a distressing incident. \"The club is aware that many individuals demonstrated extraordinary bravery which undoubtedly helped prevent even greater harm. \"The entire Nottingham Forest family stands firmly behind them as they recover from the events of yesterday.\" Forest say any fans affected by the incident should contact the club's head of fan engagement.

    "title": "Chargers’ Joe Alt carted off field with ankle injury against Titans",
    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Jim Harbaugh didn't have an update on Los Angeles Chargers left tackle Joe Alt after he was carted off the field Sunday, and what the coach said wasn't promising. Alt hurt his right ankle in the second quarter against the Tennessee Titans, and a cart came out pretty quickly to take him off the field. Alt never returned as the Chargers beat the Titans 27-20. “Yeah, feel that,” Harbaugh said when asked about seeing Alt go down. “Feel for him, feel bad for him.” Alt missed three games with a sprained right ankle and returned Oct. 23 in the Chargers' win over Minnesota. He didn't get up after a long incompletion by Justin Herbert with 4:49 left in the first half against Tennessee. Jamaree Salyer replaced Alt on the next play, and the Chargers gave up their second sack on the next play after Alt was taken off the field. The Chargers already had right tackle Bobby Hart leave in the first quarter with a groin injury. Trey Pipkins III, who came in at right tackle, said it's never easy seeing someone go down. “It’s difficult, but I mean, that’s kind of the nature of the position, right?” Pipkins said. “I feel like the O-line room specifically have a lot of camaraderie. We got a lot of tradition and that’s our standard is that when people go down, people step up.” The Chargers (6-3) wound up giving up a season-high six sacks without their offensive tackles. Harbaugh said other players stepped up. “Sometimes you could say ... the team finds itself in a situation where it’s got its back against the wall,” Harbaugh said. “I mean, that’s when you find out who you really are. Felt that’s what our guys did today. Dug deep, gritty win, found a way to win.”",

    "title": "Earthquake Today: Significant Casualties Expected As 6.3-Magnitude Quake Strikes Afghanistan",
    "text": "Date The quake was detected near the city of Mazar-i-Sharif and the town of Khulm, and struck at a depth of 23 kilometres, as per the National Center for Seismology (NCS). Given the timing of the earthquake, which struck at at 1 am local time, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) warned that it could be deadly. \"Significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread. Past events with this alert level have required a regional or national level response,\" the USGS was quoted as saying by CNN. Afghanistan's national disaster management agency said assessments on casualties and damages would be shared later, reported Reuters. Afghanistan is no stranger to deadly earthquakes, having seen major ones in the recent past. Earlier in August this year, at least 2,200 people were killed and more than 2,800 others were injured after a 6.0-magnitude struck the mountainous stretch of provinces in the eastern region of Afghanistan. The quake on 31 August had struck Afghanistan's Kunar province at 11.47 pm local time. Two years back, in October 2023, Afghanistan also saw widespread devastation after four large earthquakes measuring 6.3 in magnitude, and their aftershocks, struck near the city of Herat. Over 1,000 people lost their lives in the 2023 quake and over 2,400 were reportedly injured. (This is a developing story. Check back for updates.)

    "text": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka put on a dominant serving display in her opening match at the WTA finals, producing 10 aces in a 6-3, 6-1 win over No. 8-ranked Jasmine Paolini on Sunday. Sabalenka served four aces in the final game of the first set alone and overall put 82.7% of her first serves in play. The match, which was Sabalenka’s 500th at the WTA level, lasted 70 minutes. “I was focused, I was calm and it felt like everything was in control,” Sabalenka said. On Saturday, Sabalenka was presented with a trophy for finishing the year at No. 1. “I’m super happy and super proud of the work that has been done and that things are working and I’m getting better and better every day,” she said. “And I just hope that we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and hopefully we can stay there.” The season-ending tournament for the year’s top eight players starts with two four-woman groups of round-robin play. The top two finishers in each group advance to the semifinals. “I take this tournament as a regular tournament that I have to win five matches if I want to win the title,” Sabalenka said. “So I’m just trying to bring my best tennis and fight for every point.” In the same group, Jessica Pegula beat defending champion Coco Gauff 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-2 in an all-American matchup. Gauff again struggled with her serve, hitting 17 double-faults — including one to hand the first set to Pegula, her former doubles partner. Before she ultimately pulled it out in the tiebreaker, Gauff twice failed to serve out the second set. On her second such chance, she hit three consecutive double-faults to let Pegula break her again and force a tiebreaker. Three weeks ago, Gauff beat Pegula in the final of the Wuhan Open in China. “Obviously, little frustrated with the serve today,” Gauff said. “Overall, it was a tough match for me. Jess played well and I thought she was playing a bit smarter than she was when we played in Wuhan.” Added Pegula, “Coco is a great champion, great competitor, good friend. So it’s always tough playing her. I don’t think there’s any secrets with this group of girls here.” Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina won their opening matches on Saturday. Also Saturday, Paolini and partner Sara Errani won their opening doubles match. AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

    "title": "‘UK public have tougher stance on immigration and diversity than people in US’",
    "text": "People in the UK are less likely than their US counterparts to feel diversity strengthens society and more likely to have tougher attitudes on immigration, according to research. The findings are said to show that a common narrative about Britain being more socially liberal than America does not ring true across all issues. The National Centre for Social Research also found Reform UK voters in Britain were more likely than supporters of President Donald Trump in the US to say immigrants living in their country without permission should not be allowed to stay. While seven in 10 supporters of Mr Trump felt this way, the figure was almost eight in 10 (79%) among Reform followers. The researchers said they wanted to “better understand how public attitudes in the UK compare with those in the US, and the extent of polarisation in the two countries”. Their survey found 42% of people in the UK think there should be legal efforts to deport immigrants living here without permission, compared with just a third (33%) in the US. While almost two-thirds (64%) of respondents in the US felt diversity strengthens society, only around half (49%) of the UK public agreed. Proportions were similar when it came to how open their country is to people from around the world, with 63% in the US feeling this is essential to national identity but only 49% of people in the UK feeling this way. Alex Scholes, research director at NatCen, said: “The idea that Britain is more socially liberal than America doesn’t hold up across all issues. “While the UK is clearly more liberal on questions to do with family, sexuality and religion, attitudes to immigration and diversity show the opposite pattern. “People in the UK are less likely than those in the US to see diversity as a strength, or to think that openness to people from other countries is essential to who we are as a nation. Our findings suggest that polarisation in the two countries looks very different. “In the UK, the sharpest divides are around immigration and national identity, in the US they’re around social issues and the role of government. These differences will shape political debate on both sides in the years to come.” When it comes to issues such as abortion, contraception and same-sex marriage, people in the UK were found to be more liberal in their attitudes. The vast majority (92%) of people in the UK said contraception being widely available is good for society, compared with 78% in the US, and while around six in 10 (59%) people in the UK think same-sex marriage being legal is good for society, only around a third (34%) said so in the US. While 86% of people in the UK think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, fewer than two thirds (63%) felt this way in the US. Reform UK voters had a more liberal view on abortion, with 82% thinking it should be legal in all or most cases, compared with 35% of supporters of Mr Trump. – More than 2,000 UK residents aged 16 and over were surveyed in June 2025, being asked the same questions as more than 8,000 people in the US aged 18 and over who were surveyed in April 2024. Both were weighted to be representative of their respective country’s population.",

While almost two-thirds (64%) of respondents in the US felt diversity strengthens society, only around half (49%) of the UK public agreed. Proportions were similar when it came to how open their country is to people from around the world, with 63% in the US feeling this is essential to national identity but only 49% of people in the UK feeling this way. Alex Scholes, research director at NatCen, said: “The idea that Britain is more socially liberal than America doesn’t hold up across all issues. “While the UK is clearly more liberal on questions to do with family, sexuality and religion, attitudes to immigration and diversity show the opposite pattern. “People in the UK are less likely than those in the US to see diversity as a strength, or to think that openness to people from other countries is essential to who we are as a nation.

While 86% of people in the UK think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, fewer than two thirds (63%) felt this way in the US.

    "title": "Could AI help treat people with prostate cancer? A groundbreaking study is set to find out",
    "text": "A new study is set to investigate how AI could significantly improve doctors’ decisions regarding prostate cancer treatment. While diagnostic methods for the disease have become safer and more precise, medical professionals still face considerable challenges in accurately assessing its aggressiveness in individual patients. This difficulty can lead to some men undergoing invasive procedures such as surgery or radiotherapy, when a less aggressive monitoring approach might have been more appropriate. The crucial Vanguard Path study, spearheaded by researchers at the University of Oxford, is being funded with a £1.9m grant from the charity Prostate Cancer UK to address this vital issue. Experts will first test the technology – called ArteraAI Prostate Biopsy Assay – on prostate biopsy samples from men who have already been diagnosed and treated for the disease and have at least five years of follow-up data. The study will compare how well the predictions made by the AI tool match what happened to patients in the real world. It will then be tested in real clinics on biopsies from men as they are diagnosed, with a focus on cases in which doctors find it hard to decide the best course of treatment. The three NHS organisations taking part are North Bristol NHS Trust, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Professor Clare Verrill, lead researcher on the project, said the trial “will pave the way for advanced AI technologies” to be rolled out on the NHS. “This will enable more detailed and precise information to be provided to men who will be able to make better-informed decisions with their clinical team about whether they can be safely monitored or need treatment – and, if so, help guide those decisions,” she added. Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “AI has the potential to massively improve prostate cancer care and make sure that every man has the most accurate and best treatment plan for his specific cancer. “We’ve been working with Artera for several years now and I believe that their AI tool is one of the most exciting ones to have been developed. But exciting AI tools can only make a difference if they can be properly evaluated. “This new project from Professor Verrill and her team is so exciting, because it tests this new technology in real-world settings, meaning we can deliver the final evidence needed for it to be rolled out across the NHS.” Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males and about one in eight men will have it in their lifetime, according to Prostate Cancer UK. Some 58,218 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in England in 2024, up from 53,462 the year before, according to the National Prostate Cancer Audit (NPCA). Andre Esteva, chief executive and co-founder of Artera, said: “We developed the ArteraAI Prostate Biopsy Assay to help improve the lives of prostate cancer patients and have spent years gathering evidence about its potential impact. “We’re delighted to be working with Professor Verrill and her team to see how the test could be used to maximise benefit for men in the NHS and hope that we will soon see the tool being used to personalise prostate cancer care for men in the UK.” News of the study comes days after it emerged an NHS trial will use AI to interpret MRI scans from men suspected of having prostate cancer. If the software detects a scan it deems high risk for the disease, it will be sent to radiologists for priority review and the patient will be booked in for a same-day biopsy. Specialists can then review results and either rule out or diagnose prostate cancer faster. The pilot will run in 15 hospitals, NHS England said.

    "title": "Judge again bars Trump administration from deploying troops to Portland",
    "text": "A federal judge in Oregon has once again barred President Donald Trump’s administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon until at least Friday PORTLAND, Ore. -- A federal judge in Oregon on Sunday barred President Donald Trump’s administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon until at least Friday, saying she “found no credible evidence” that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall. The city and state sued in September to block the deployment. It's the latest development in weeks of legal back-and-forth in Portland, Chicago and other U.S. cities as the Trump administration has moved to federalize and deploy the National Guard in city streets to quell protests. The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law. In a 16-page filing late Sunday, Immergut said she would issue a final order on Friday due to the voluminous evidence presented at trial, including more than 750 exhibits. The purpose of the deployment, according to the Trump administration, is to protect federal personnel and property where protests are occurring or likely to occur. Legal experts said that a higher appellate court order that remains in effect would have barred troops from being deployed anyway. Immergut wrote that most violence appeared to be between protesters and counter-protesters and found no evidence of “significant damage” to the immigration facility at the center of the protests. \"Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President’s federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,” she wrote. The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue — seek to push back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states’ sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because it has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces — one of the conditions set by Congress for calling up troops. Immergut issued two orders in early October that blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. She previously found that Trump had failed to show that he met the legal requirements for mobilizing the National Guard. She described his assessment of Portland, which Trump has called “war-ravaged” with “fires all over the place,” as “simply untethered to the facts.” One of Immergut’s orders was paused Oct. 20 by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But late Tuesday, the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the matter before an 11-judge panel. Until the larger panel rehears the case, the appeals court’s initial order from early October — under which the National Guard is federalized but not deployed — remains in effect. During the Portland trial, witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city’s ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Trump’s National Guard announcement. The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion” — another one of the conditions for calling up troops under federal law. Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., due to safety concerns. R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland’s ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter. He also said he was “surprised” to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down. Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified. Another Federal Protective Service official whom the judge also allowed to testify under his initials said protesters have at times been violent, damaged the facility and acted aggressively toward officers working at the building. The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer due to property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions. Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Scott Kennedy said that “without minimizing or condoning offensive expressions” or certain instances of criminal conduct, “none of these incidents suggest ... that there’s a rebellion or an inability to execute the laws.” ___ Johnson reported from Seattle. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "title": "Women in Blue, World Champions: Tech titans Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella hail India’s historic World Cup win",
    "text": "New Delhi, Nov 3, 2025 Global tech leaders Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella joined millions of Indians in celebrating the country’s maiden triumph at the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025, lauding the team’s grit, inspiration, and historic achievement. Google CEO Sundar Pichai took to X to express his excitement after India’s thrilling victory over South Africa in the final at DY Patil Stadium on Sunday. “That was a nail-biting women’s world cup cricket final, memories of 1983 and 2011 indeed. Congrats to Team India, am sure will inspire a whole generation. Great tournament from South Africa too!” he wrote, drawing parallels between the women’s team’s triumph and India’s iconic men’s World Cup wins. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also saluted the champions in his post, declaring, “Women in Blue = World Champions! Respect to South Africa for making their first-ever final. A truly historic day for women’s cricket—new chapters written, barriers broken, legends born.” His words reflected the broader sentiment that India’s win marks a new era for women’s sport globally. The posts from two of the world’s most influential tech leaders underscored the worldwide recognition of India’s achievement. India’s women’s team made history by clinching their first-ever Women’s ODI World Cup, defeating South Africa by 52 runs. All-rounder Deepti Sharma was the star performer, scoring 58 runs and taking a five-wicket haul to seal the win. Put in to bat, India rode on Deepti’s fifty and a solid top-order effort to post 298/7 in 50 overs. The South African chase, anchored by captain Laura Wolvaardt’s valiant innings, ended at 246 in 45.3 overs, as the Indian bowlers held their nerve to script history. With this win, India became only the third country, after England and Australia, to have won both the men’s and women’s ODI World Cups. The triumph was even more special as the Indian team had endured a difficult journey, losing three consecutive matches in the group stage and barely qualifying for the semifinals. They then stunned Australia before overpowering South Africa in the final. The final, already being hailed as one of the greatest in tournament history, has not only united fans across the globe but also reaffirmed India’s growing dominance in world cricket.(Agency)",

    "text": "China has announced an extension of its visa-free entry policy for 45 countries, including France, Germany, and Spain, until December 31, 2026. This policy, effective from November 10, will also now include Sweden, as per the foreign ministry's announcement on Monday. This extension encompasses 32 European countries alongside Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and several countries from South America and the Gulf region. Initially set to expire at the year's end, this policy aims to attract more foreign visitors, revitalize a tourism sector hit hard by stringent COVID-19 restrictions, and enhance international engagement. Notably, the United States, Canada, and Britain remain excluded from this list. The policy allows citizens from eligible nations to visit China for up to 30 days for business, tourism, or family visits without a visa. Furthermore, China is seeking to strengthen its ties with the European Union, a critical trading partner amid challenging trade relations. In addition, following discussions last week, Beijing confirmed a one-year suspension of its expanded rare earth export controls to the EU as part of efforts to stabilize industrial and supply chains.

    "text": "Liverpool returned to winning ways with a 2-0 victory over Aston Villa to end their four-game losing streak in the Premier League. Pressure was piling on Arne Slot after the Reds slumped to ninth in the table, but even without a number of key players, the champions were able to sweep Villa aside to move back up to third. They welcome Real Madrid - Trent Alexander-Arnold, Xabi Alonso, et al - to Anfield in midweek, before they take on Manchester City in a mouth-watering encounter at the weekend. But will they have any of their star names back from injury? Ahead of a big few weeks, here’s all the latest Liverpool injury news and return dates... Alexander Isak has endured a tough start to life on Merseyside. Subbed at half-time in Liverpool’s 5-1 win over Frankfurt in the Champions League, Slot later revealed the £125million summer signing had suffered a minor groin injury. “Alexander had to go off at half-time because he felt his groin a little bit. That's a pity,” said Slot. “I've said many times it is such a difficult balance to find with a player that missed three months.” Isak was not in the squad in the 3-2 loss at Brentford, and he also missed out on the Carabao Cup defeat against Crystal Palace, as well as the win over Villa. Slot has provided no further update on the Swede. Potential return date: Unknown Jeremie Frimpong is facing a second spell on the sidelines, and he is just months into his Liverpool career. He suffered a hamstring injury against Bournemouth on his Premier League debut and suffered the same fate against Frankfurt. The right-back was dealt a further blow last week, with reports revealing that the Dutchman would be out of action for six weeks. That means that he could miss games against Aston Villa, Real Madrid, Manchester City, Nottingham Forest, PSV Eindhoven and West Ham at the very least. Potential return date: December Curtis Jones started against Brentford, but asked to be replaced in the second half after going down with an injury. The exact nature or severity of his issue is not clear but Slot did not seem overly alarmed by his condition when he spoke at full-time. He said: “We have to wait and see. He asked to be taken off. He walked off instead of needing a lot of treatment so I have to wait and see.” He was not involved in the squads against Palace or Villa. Potential return date: Unknown Alisson Becker suffered a hamstring injury against Galatasaray in September. Speaking ahead of the Brentford game, Slot said: \"Alisson is not in the squad tomorrow. That's also going to take a little bit longer.\" Slot had previously suggested that Alisson was weeks away from returning but this week’s two key games - as much as the Reds would love their first-choice shot-stopper back - may come too soon. Potential return date: November Leoni suffered an ACL injury on his Liverpool debut against Southampton back in September. The 18-year-old impressed in his first minutes in red, but was stretchered off shortly after. He later underwent surgery and is expected to spend a year on the sidelines. “He’s not in a good place, of course,” Slot said of the Italian. “He tore his ACL which means that he will be out for around a year.” Potential return date: Late 2026",

    "title": "BCCI announces Rs 51 crore reward as India’s women clinch maiden World Cup",
    "text": "New Delhi, Nov 3: In a watershed moment for Indian cricket, the national women’s team etched their name in history by winning their first-ever ICC Women’s World Cup title, defeating South Africa by 52 runs in a pulsating final at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday night. Celebrations erupted across the country as BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia reportedly announced a Rs 51 crore reward for the players and support staff, hailing the victory as a “monumental achievement that will take Indian women’s cricket to a new level.” Meanwhile, IPL chairman Arun Dhumal lauded the team’s historic feat, drawing parallels with India’s iconic 1983 men’s World Cup triumph. “It’s a red-letter day for Indian women’s cricket. What the men’s team achieved in 1983, the Indian women have recreated today in Mumbai. This historic triumph will give a tremendous boost to women’s cricket in the country, and I’m confident our game will now reach new heights,” Dhumal said. Earlier, batting first, India posted a commanding 298/7, powered by Shafali Verma’s fluent 87, Deepti Sharma’s composed 58, and valuable contributions from Smriti Mandhana (45) and Richa Ghosh (34). A solid 100-run opening stand between Mandhana and Verma set the platform for a big total before South Africa clawed back late to keep India just under the 300-mark. Chasing 299, South Africa began confidently as Tazmin Brits and Laura Wolvaardt put together a brisk fifty-run opening partnership. But a sharp direct hit from Amanjot Kaur ended Brits’ stay, and from there, India seized control of the contest. Young pacer Sree Charani struck in her first over, trapping Anneke Bosch LBW, before Shafali Verma — shining with the ball as well — produced a game-turning spell, removing Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp in quick succession. Deepti Sharma then delivered a dream performance, claiming 5 for 39 to crush South Africa’s middle order. Despite Wolvaardt’s fighting 101, the Proteas fell short, bundled out for 246 in 45.3 overs, as India sealed a famous 52-run victory amid roaring home support. As the tricolour soared high and the players embraced in tears of joy, the moment marked not just a World Cup triumph — but the dawn of a new era for Indian women’s cricket. IANS",

    "title": "What's on the ballot in the first general election since Donald Trump became president",
    "text": "Donald Trump features prominently in state and local elections happening Tuesday, a year after he retook the White House WASHINGTON -- One year after Donald Trump retook the White House and set into motion a dramatic expansion of executive power, the Republican president figures prominently in state and local elections being held Tuesday. The results of those contests — the first general election of Trump's second term — will be heralded by the victors as either a major repudiation or resounding stamp of approval of his second-term agenda. That's especially true in high-profile races for Virginia and New Jersey governor, New York City mayor and a California proposition to redraw its congressional district boundaries. More than half of the states will hold contests on Tuesday. Here's a look at some of the major statewide and local races on the ballot: In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are the nominees to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. Sherrill is a four-term U.S. representative and former Navy helicopter pilot. Ciattarelli is a former state Assemblyman backed by Trump. In 2021, Ciattarelli came within about 3 percentage points of toppling Murphy. In Virginia, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and Democratic former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger look to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. While Spanberger has made some efforts to focus on topics other than Trump in stump speeches, the president remained a major topic of conversation throughout the campaign, from comments Earle-Sears made about him in 2022 to some of his more polarizing policies, such as the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill tax and spending cut measure and the widespread dismissal of federal workers, many of whom live in northern Virginia. Trump was scheduled to participate in telephone rallies for the candidates on Monday night. As the only gubernatorial races held in the year following a presidential election, the contests have long served as the first major test of voter sentiment toward the party holding the White House. In every race for governor since 1973, one or both states have elected a governor from a party different than that of the sitting president. The race to lead the nation’s largest city features Democratic state legislator Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate and former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani’s comfortable victory over Cuomo in the June primary generated excitement from the party’s more progressive wing and apprehension among the party establishment. Party leaders like Gov. Kathy Hochul and U.S. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries eventually endorsed the self-described democratic socialist months after he won the nomination. The winner will replace outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, who initially sought renomination as a Democrat. After losing the primary Adams opted to run as an independent, but dropped out of the race in September and eventually endorsed Cuomo. In February, the Trump Justice Department asked a court to drop corruption charges against Adams because the case impeded Trump’s “ immigration objectives.” Trump later said he’d like to see both Adams and Sliwa drop out of the race in an effort to defeat Mamdani. California voters will decide a statewide ballot measure that would enact a new congressional map that could flip as many as five Republican-held U.S. House seats to Democratic control. Proposition 50, championed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, is in response to a new Texas map that state Republicans enacted in August as part of Trump’s efforts to keep the U.S. House under Republican control in the 2026 midterms. The Texas plan, which could help Republicans flip five Democratic-held U.S. House seats, has sparked an escalating gerrymandering arms race among states to pass new maps outside of the regular once-a-decade schedule. Control of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will be at stake when voters cast Yes or No votes on whether to retain three justices from the high court’s 5-2 Democratic majority. Partisan control of the court could have major implications for the 2028 presidential race, since justices might be asked to rule on election disputes, as they did in 2020. Spending on Tuesday's contests is on track to exceed $15 million as Republicans have campaigned to end the majority and Democrats have responded. If all three justices are ousted, a deadlock in the confirmation process to replace them could result in a court tied at 2-2. An election to fill any vacant seats for full 10-year terms would be held in 2027. VIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Republican incumbent Jason Miyares seeks a second term against Democrat Jay Jones. Much of the fall campaign has focused on text messages suggesting violence against political rivals that Jones sent in 2022. TEXAS-18: Sixteen candidates hope to fill a vacant congressional seat previously held by the late Democratic U.S. Rep. Sylvester Turner. STATE LEGISLATURES: Control of the Minnesota Senate and Virginia House of Delegates is at stake, while New Jersey Democrats defend their 52-28 General Assembly majority. BALLOT MEASURES: Maine voters will decide statewide questions on voting and a “red flag” law aimed at preventing gun violence. Texas’ 17 ballot measures include constitutional amendments on parental rights and limiting voting to U.S. citizens. Colorado and Washington also have statewide measures on the ballot. MAYORS: Detroit, Pittsburgh, Jersey City and Buffalo will elect new mayors, while incumbents in Atlanta, Minneapolis and Cincinnati seek another term. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the 2025 election at https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2025/. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "title": "Asking Eric: Does my husband’s family exclude him from birthday tradition because they think he’s rich?",
    "text": "Dear Eric: My husband and I have been married for almost 10 years. He has three siblings, and it seems like he’s the forgotten one. His mom and siblings always put money together and send it for each other’s birthdays. Last year and the year before that, they did it for everyone’s birthday except my husband. He was very upset about it but said nothing. This year his mom asked him and his siblings to send money to give another sibling for their birthday. My husband, of course, sent the money. I’m tired of my husband participating in everyone’s birthday and then being ignored for his. I would love to speak up and say something but not sure it’s my place to do that as an in-law. I’m just trying to figure out if there’s a nice way to let them know how hurtful it is or if there’s a way to get out of sending money since my husband is excluded. I would like to add that they all get along great and they’re close so not sure why he’s always left out. His mom did tell one of her friends not to send us anything because we make too much money and don’t need it. Our income is average/barely middle class for the state we live in. We are not rich and one of his siblings makes more money than us. I’m frustrated about the whole situation and would appreciate your advice on how to handle it. – Fed Up with Exclusions Dear Fed Up: It sounds like your husband could use an advocate and the family could use some help with communication. You can start the ball rolling on both by taking the reins. Rally folks yourself for your husband’s birthday. You can even tell his mother and siblings, “I notice that this is a family tradition, and I think it makes him feel left out to not get anything for his birthday, so I decided to organize on his behalf this year. It will mean a lot.” The other family members might see your point and gladly chip in. Or they might protest, and this is where the conversation about money might come up, giving you a chance to correct their misconception. Also, if they don’t want to give money, surely there’s some other way they include him. Ultimately, from your view, it’s not so much about cash as it is about feeling loved. Lead with that and it may help your husband’s mother and siblings open their eyes, and, potentially, their wallets. Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O.

    "title": "The real test of Lee’s pragmatic diplomacy comes after APEC",
    "text": "The end of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Gyeongju marked the conclusion of a crucial, jam-packed week of diplomacy for South Korea, with the leaders of two superpowers — the US and China — both in attendance. At the helm of the first large-scale international summit event hosted by South Korea in 20 years was President Lee Jae Myung, who cleared away economic and security-related uncertainties by wrapping up negotiations with the US while taking the first steps to repair Seoul’s estrangement from Beijing. Lee also met with other leaders in the Asia-Pacific region and shored up trust aimed at building a future of shared prosperity. But many observers are saying the real challenge starts now as South Korea seeks to navigate the kind of worst-case scenario that it narrowly avoided by adopting a pragmatic focus on national interests amid a rapidly changing “new normal” in the global order. “We did a pretty good job of toughing things out in a situation where the outcome was never going to be 100% satisfactory to us,” assessed Korea National Diplomatic Academy professor Jun Bong-geun on Sunday regarding the agreements reached on trade and security matters at a South Korea-US summit. “For now, the fog has been cleared away,” he added, suggesting the outcomes can be viewed positively as Lee having taken care of immediate uncertainties while sidestepping a worst-case scenario in dealing with US President Donald Trump, who is known for unpredictability. Along similar lines, former KNDA Chancellor Hong Hyun-ik said that Lee had “made the best available choice without stalling for time in a world where the ‘new normal’ is US overreach.” The arrangement reached on the biggest issue concerning the fund for South Korean investment in the US — where the total of cash investment was set at US$200 billion and capped at US$20 billion annually — was more or less a realistic compromise solution. In other words, Seoul went for the next-best or least-worst option under hegemonic trade pressures from the Trump administration. Commenting on this, Kim Joon-hyung, a former chancellor of the KDNA and current Rebuilding Korea Party lawmaker, said that South Korea “will need to adjust the pace, frequency and intensity of investment during the future implementation process.” In the summit’s immediate wake, the US made claims that conflicted with the South Korean government’s announcement, including Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick’s insistence that semiconductor tariffs were not part of the agreement. Kim’s remarks suggested that Seoul will need to adopt a firm stance as differences arise between the two sides in the implementation process. Observers similarly rated Lee’s summit with Xi Jinping as a generally successful first step, with the Chinese president taking steps to repair relations on his first visit to South Korea in 11 years. Seoul and Beijing have been on distant terms owing to friction over the deployment of a US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile system in Korea in 2016 and foreign policies under the Yoon Suk-yeol administration that were heavily skewed toward the US. While the summit did not fulfill hopes for a second-phase upgrade to the two sides’ free trade agreement or securing China’s definite support for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, analysts suggested this was more than could be expected as a first step. According to sources, Xi and Lee appeared to enjoy a pleasant conversation at a closed-door dinner, where they openly discussed advancements in bilateral relations. What remains now is the task of translating that into concrete improvements, including the lifting of Chinese restrictions on Korean cultural content. “While relations with the US and Japan have substantially progressed and been established, we’re still working on restoring trust with China, so we should strongly consider a visit to China before the end of the year,” Hong said. Some observers in the diplomatic world said that for Lee’s “pragmatic diplomacy” to truly contribute to upholding the national interest, he will need to focus on balanced diplomacy between China and the US now that Korea is back on track to restoring its relationship with the former and the latter continues to demand one-sided sacrifices from its allies. One source in the foreign affairs community stressed, “We need to avoid the situation where we’re pressed to take sides as the competition between the US and China intensifies, and that will require the wisdom to manage bilateral relations well from the middle ground.” By Um Ji-won, staff reporter Please direct questions or comments to [english@hani.co.kr]",

    "title": "Accounting experts call for public inquiry into Birmingham bankruptcy",
    "text": "Warakorn - stock.adobe.com Thirty-five accounting, finance and local government experts have signed an open letter to local government minister Steve Reed, calling for a public inquiry into the bankruptcy of Birmingham City Council. The open letter, which looks at the latest accounts from the council, notes that some of the figures used to “bankrupt” Birmingham City Council, including forecast levels of reserves and alleged equal pay liabilities, look like they have been materially misstated. Since the failed implementation of an Oracle enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to replace SAP in April 2022, the council has faced significant issues with the processes and interfaces, as well as the system’s ability to produce reports. In effect, the council was unable to find out what money was being spent, what it was owed and how much it had received. Budget forecasting had to be carried out based on the best available data and organisational intelligence. In April 2023, council leader John Cotton discussed the disastrous implementation of the ERP system, and in September 2023, the council issued a Section 114 bankruptcy notice. Birmingham City Council’s Section 114 bankruptcy notice led to a rise in the council’s borrowing costs, an 18% rise in Council Tax bills, along with the ongoing bin strike dispute with Unite the Union. Significantly, the council has had to cut its budget and sell assets to help it reduce costs. The letter also states that there has been a steep rise in external audit fees and the significant costs charged by the city’s commissioners, who were appointed without the usual best value assessment. In a post on X, James Brackley a lecturer in accounting at University of Glasgow, who prepared an analysis of the accounting at Birmingham City Council, wrote: “The latest analysis proves beyond doubt that Birmingham was never ‘bankrupt’ with the bankruptcy & subsequent intervention being based on imagined data as the authority underestimated its reserves and exaggerated its (non-existent) deficits by hundreds of millions of pounds. This has since led to the biggest program of cuts and asset sales any authority has ever faced.” He added that the asset sales in 2024/25 against an underlying balanced position actually led to huge surpluses across all core reserves in the latest accounts. Commenting on the post, Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, tweeted: “Government Commissioners, being paid £1200 a day, are not needed. Unite repeatedly advised the council that their figures were simply wrong, as was their legal advice. This is a disgraceful tale. Yet again, workers and residents are paying the price for a crisis and incompetence not of their making.” Following the publication of a Grant Thornton report in February 2025, which looked at what went wrong with the implementation of the Oracle system, the council revised the implementation of Oracle to April 2026. However, as of September 2025, it is believed that the income management system (IMS) at Birmingham City Council – a key application that needs to work with the Oracle system – is not fully working. Previously, the lack of a fully functioning IMS meant workarounds were needed for financial reporting.",

When I asked her to leave, she started crying and said, “I’m so disappointed that my first-born married such an awful human being.” Advice? -- DISRESPECTED IN RHODE ISLAND DEAR DISRESPECTED: Clearly, you do not like your mother-in-law, and the feelings are mutual. She was wrong to cross the boundary by criticizing your wife during that lunch, but you may have overstepped by ordering her to leave. Depending upon how close a relationship your wife would like to have with her mother, some sessions with a licensed family therapist may be in order if the three of you are willing. DEAR ABBY: My son-in-law says I am lazy and antisocial because I use the drive-up grocery option. I told him that when I use the drive-up, I do less impulse buying and save time and money. Am I wrong? -- INSULTED IN WISCONSIN DEAR INSULTED: Of course you are not wrong. What you are doing works for you, and you shouldn’t be criticized for it. Ask yourself why your passive-aggressive son-in-law feels the need to put you down. Is there something else going on in your relationship with him ... or in his head?

    "title": "Amol Muzumdar: One of the greatest to never play for India carves his own cricketing legacy",
    "text": "New Delhi: Despite scoring truckloads of runs in domestic cricket, Amol Muzumdar’s dream of representing India never saw the light of day. Perhaps, fate had planned it all along. During his school days, Muzumdar was rated highly along with his schoolmates Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli at Shardashram Vidyamandir School in Mumbai. Coached by Ramakant Achrekar, Muzumdar once famously waited with his pads on for two days as Achrekar’s other two students, Tendulkar and Kambli, shared a world-record 664-run partnership in a 1988 school. Mazumdar never got a chance to bat, and while Tendulkar and Kambli went on to play for India, Muzumdar, despite proving himself in domestic cricket year after year, kept waiting for his chance and finally ended a two-decade-long illustrious career in 2014. It was destiny’s call that a player of Muzumdar’s calibre couldn’t don the India colours. It was destiny’s call, too, that 11 years after retirement, he realised his India dream by guiding the women’s team to a historic maiden ODI World Cup title. After his playing days were over, Muzumdar transitioned to coaching and built a reputation as a mentor who is an expert in reading players and situations. In domestic cricket, he coached Mumbai, Andhra, and later worked with the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL before moving to the international stage with a stint with South Africa’s cricket team as a batting consultant. When Muzumdar was appointed as India’s women’s coach in 2023, the team was in turmoil after years of instability in the coaching set-up. However, he quickly won over the dressing room, built the foundation of a cohesive team and rallied the team to aim towards one goal. His leadership style worked wonders for the team and superstar players like Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana, and Deepti Sharma. After a solid start to the campaign, the Women in Blue suffered multiple setbacks, which threatened to derail their campaign. However, Muzumdar’s strong reminder to the team of their abilities and goal helped India regroup and find a newfound energy and rhythm. Listening to a man who embodies grit and resilience worked like a magic potion for the team, evident from two extraordinary performances – vs Australia in the semifinal and vs South Africa in the final. On November 2, 2025, the historic day when India defeated South Africa to lift their maiden World Cup, life came a full circle for Muzumdar, one of the greatest cricketers to never play for India.

    "title": "Real reason Andrew's Royal Lodge eviction announcement took so long",
    "text": "Andrew hit an all-time royal low last week as it was announced he was to be stripped of all his royal titles and evicted from his 30-room Royal Lodge home. Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming. While the King’s actions have been praised, some believe the monarch, 76, took too long to take action, especially over evicting the former prince from his Crown Estate mansion, however Queen Elizabeth's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson has now explained why.

You can check out at any time. Read our Privacy Policy Talking to People magazine, Anderson said: \"Andrew had been dragging his heels. They (the Royal Family) had to take constitutional advice and legal advice and over the lease on Royal Lodge. \"They had to get all the dots on I’s and T’s crossed before they made this announcement.\" Anderson also said the situation would have been “difficult” for the King, especially as Andrew is his younger brother. She said: “It must be mixed emotions for him (the King). That is why this has taken such a long time. It is family and monarchy, and when the lines are blurred, it’s very difficult for them.” Andrew is expected to leave Royal Lodge within months despite originally having a lease until 2078. It was confirmed last week that he will move to a property on the monarch’s private Sandringham estate. It is unlikely the former prince will be seen on the royal stage again except for very rare occasions.

    "title": "Our pick for the best budget TV just dropped to its lowest-ever price on Amazon",
    "text": "The best TVs come in all shapes and sizes, and as a result, it can be difficult to know what to buy. One that we'd recommend right now is the Roku Pro Series 65-inch Mini LED QLED TV at Amazon for $799.99 (was $1,199.99) – that's a 33% discount, which drops the TV to its lowest-ever price. But it's not just the price that is worthy of your attention. Thanks to the pairing of mini-LED and QLED technology, the Roku Pro Series offers picture quality that is sharp, vivid, and colorful. It's so good that it's our pick for the best budget TV you can buy, so if you're looking for a top TV without breaking the bank this Black Friday, it could be just the deal for you This TV boasts a lot for the price. 4K resolution. Mini-LED. QLED. Roku interface. 65 inches. What more could you want? Maybe a seriously juicy discount. Yep, that's included as well. You can now save a generous $400 on the Roku TV ahead of Black Friday, making one of our top budget picks even better value for money. Our reviewer of the Roku Pro Series TV gave the set an impressive 4.5 out of five stars. That's excellent, especially given its budget-friendly price tag. The high praise is due to the 4K resolution support and smooth 120Hz refresh rate, which is ideal for general viewing, movies, and fast-paced and immersive gaming. There are also side-firing speakers that provide superior sound quality. Our reviewer also made mention of the carefully considered design, which is intentionally thicker so that it mounts flush against the wall instead of precariously jutting out like most TVs. Finally, we know you don't buy a TV for the remote, but a well-designed one certainly helps with any viewing experience. This TV ships with a Roku Voice Remote Pro, which is pretty special thanks to its features and fancy backlighting. All in all, this TV is so good that it claimed the best budget TV spot in our best TV buyer's guide. 65-inch TVs are not for everyone, so if you'd prefer something a little bit smaller, then we recommend checking out our guide to the best 50-inch TVs.

Fuaga, the Saints' 2024 first-round draft pick out of Oregon State, was seen in the locker room Monday wearing a protective boot on his right foot. Fuaga was injured in the Saints’ 34-10 loss to the Rams. He left the field on a cart late in the fourth quarter with a towel covering his face. Asim Richards replaced Fuaga in the lineup. Fuaga has dealt with several injuries this season.

    "title": "Indore News: Metro To Go Underground From Khajrana Square",
    "text": "Indore (Madhya Pradesh): The Indore Metro route will now go underground from Khajrana Square itself, passing through Palasia to Bada Ganpati, as approved in a high-level meeting chaired by urban development and housing minister Kailash Vijayvargiya on Monday. The decision, finalized after hours of detailed discussions, is being hailed as a major step towards improving traffic management and urban mobility in the city. The proposal for the underground stretch of the metro from Khajrana to Bada Ganpati via Palasia received unanimous approval. Minister Vijayvargiya said, “This decision will prove historic for Indore, both for the city’s economic growth as well as traffic management. Together, we will make this project a success.” He said that all public representatives unanimously decided to make the Metro train route underground from the Khajrana area. He explained that in the earlier design, the Metro was planned to go underground from Nath Mandir Road near the high court, to Bada Ganpati. However, under the new plan, the route would now be taken underground from Khajrana itself. The minister further informed that a Malharganj Metro station would be constructed, but no houses or shops would be affected in the process. Using advanced tunnelling technology, similar to the one used in Chandni Chowk (Delhi), a machine would bore the tunnel without causing any surface damage. Vijayvargiya added, “We will hold meetings with local residents to explain that the Metro team must be allowed to work. Not even a flowerpot will be broken, everything will remain just as it is.” More about this section will be decided in detail after the company redesigns a significant route for the proposed underground track. Then feasibility testing and soil testing of the route will be started. The minister also directed officials to immediately disconnect all illegal water connections linked to under-construction water tanks and distribution lines under the AMRUT scheme. He emphasized that all road restoration work must be carried out using cutting machines rather than manual digging to maintain technical quality. Mayor Pushyamitra Bhargav instructed that construction work under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana be completed at the earliest and suggested appointing a traffic engineer to plan future mobility systems. He also raised concern over the slow progress of the Marathi Kala Sankul project under the Smart City. Additional chief secretary Sanjay Dubey directed that vacant land in the MOG Lines area be developed with attractive designs. He also emphasized simplifying the TDR process and ensuring that sewage, water supply and stormwater lines were integrated into all new road projects. Minister Vijayvargiya said that officers would be held accountable for the rise in illegal colonies and instructed the launch of a strict campaign to prevent unauthorized construction. He urged officials to involve public representatives in all major decision-making processes to ensure better implementation and transparency. Highlighting Indore as Madhya Pradesh’s first self-reliant city, the minister said that the Municipal Corporation must focus on increasing revenue and reducing expenditure while maintaining high-quality infrastructure. He also praised the Mayor for his long-term vision of the Narmada Phase-IV project, calling it a farsighted step for Indore’s future. During the meeting, various development projects under AMRUT Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Smart City Mission and Indore Metro Project were comprehensively reviewed. Senior officials from the Indore Municipal Corporation, Indore Development Authority and Metro Rail Corporation were present. Rajya Sabha MP Kavita Patidar, Mayor Pushyamitra Bhargav, MLAs Madhu Verma, Mahendra Hardia, Golu Shukla, Metro MD S Krishna Chaitanya, commissioner Dr Sudam Khade, municipal commissioner Dilip Kumar Yadav, IDA CEO Dr Parikshit Jhade and other senior officials were also present.",

    "title": "Small firms want govt to prioritise forex solutions",
    "text": "Small Scale Business Importers and Exporters Association has appealed to the new administration to prioritise addressing foreign exchange scarcity, describing it as the backbone of the country’s economic challenges. The association’s secretary general Frank Mhango said this in Lilongwe on Friday at a time foreign exchange reserves continue to decline and are now recorded at below one month of import cover, thereby straining business operations. Briefing journalists, he warned that if businesses continue to access foreign exchange from the black market, prices of goods and services will continue to rise. Mhango said apart from medium to long-term solutions such as increasing production and securing forex inflows from development partners, the Reserve Bank of Malawi should follow up with commercial banks on how they are rationing the available forex. He claimed that some banks allocate forex to a few companies at the expense of small and medium enterprises operations. “Our message to the new administration is that they should put foreign exchange issues seriously because if we continue getting the dollar at K4 000 on black market, then things will continue to worse,” said Mhango. The group’s executive member Alfred Manda also raised outstanding taxation issues that Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) should address, including duty on tax-compliant traders. He said: “We also wanted express our commitment to ensure that our sector is formalised and that all our members should comply with Taxation Act. “We also need MRA to set standard and reasonable duty to importers because some members complain that they are being overtaxed.” In an interview on Sunday, Reserve Bank of Malawi spokesperson Boston Maliketi Banda acknowledged that short-term solutions such as demand management and currency devaluations have proven ineffective to address the foreign exchange challenges. He said the central bank is collaborating with the government, the financial industry and the private sector to prioritise and invest in productive sectors with high export potential. “The country’s persistent foreign exchange shortages are a symptom of a deep-rooted, structural imbalance. For decades, our imports have significantly exceeded our exports,” said Maliketi Banda. In a separate interview on Sunday, Financial Market Dealers Association president Leslie Fatch said reduced supply of foreign exchange has affected commercial banks’ ability to service the market, adding that rationing forex is just a reaction to the drop in supply. “Considering that structural challenges are yet to be fully addressed in the market, for now banks have to actively prioritise on which bills to be serviced with the limited resources,” he said. In August this year, RBM announced a reduction in the mandatory conversion rate for export revenues from 30 percent to 25 percent, with further reductions for qualifying companies anticipated.",

    "title": "Trump administration says SNAP will return after court order",
    "text": "MOSCOW — Cass Davis spent the last week fishing as much as he could. He couldn’t afford not to, he said. Depending on how quickly he gets his food stamps, he might need it. “ I’ve been going salmon fishing despite the fact that I got a cold and I was miserable this morning,” he said. “ I really want to put a whole bunch of smoked salmon in my freezer.” Davis, a Moscow resident, lives on a fixed income due to disabilities. To get to his fishing spot, he barters with friends to give fishing lessons in exchange for a ride; he can’t afford the gas. Davis is one of roughly 130,000 Idahoans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. In Washington, that number is about 888,000 people. SNAP covers about $200 of Davis’ monthly groceries. He said the stress of worrying about finances has been bad for his health. “What they’ve done by taking away my food stamps is put me in a real pickle,” he said. “It’s more than I’m not eating right. I’m stressing like hell now.” On Friday, two federal judges ruled the Trump administration must use contingency funds to continue SNAP benefits. Federal Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday those benefits might resume as early as Wednesday. But other agencies who work with SNAP recipients have expressed skepticism about that timeline, stating it might take weeks for funds to come through. A representative for Idaho Health and Welfare said the agency did not have formal guidance on when SNAP benefits would be distributed. Janna Jones is the manager at the West Side Food Pantry in Moscow, operated by the nonprofit Inland Oasis. She said this month, she expects to see more families with children using the pantry. “Families have the hardest time extending their dollars,” she said. “If you’re looking at SNAP benefits, the largest population are households with children.” Roughly 36% of SNAP recipients are children, according to the Pew Research Center. The pantry held a food drive in response to the SNAP cutoff deadline Sunday. It collected 8,342 pounds of food from that drive and donations the week before. That’s a heartening sign, said volunteer Nick Koenig. “ We show up for community,” Koenig said. “We’re gonna still have our pantry doors open for you.” Still, if SNAP isn’t restored, the number of people who are on it in Moscow could roughly double the pantry’s current numbers, Koenig said. If that many people came in, the pantry would need a lot more food drives. “I think we could do a week, with what we’ve gotten thus far,” Koenig said. Even before the uncertainty with SNAP, the food pantry’s monthly use had grown from almost 1,400 in September 2022 to 2,156 this September. Two of the largest groups with increased pantry usage have been seniors and low-income people with full-time-jobs. Davis said he’s been lucky enough to be able to rely on friends who can help him out. When his van broke down last month, it cost him $1,600, some of which he had to borrow from friends. He’s now trying to pay that off. But Davis said he worries losing SNAP will put him into more debt. “ I don’t really think that people who work in Washington, D.C., really understand what ‘poor’ is,” Davis said. “People who are trying to pay rent, and pay utilities, and pay insurance, and everything that we have to — it equals no money after bills are paid.” Jessica Proctor manages the Deary Community Food Bank. She said some patrons drive from as far as Clarkia — about 30 minutes away — to use the food bank. That’s in part because until recently, it hadn’t needed to limit visitors to a certain amount of food. “We’ve gotten so little meat that we have to basically hand it out when people come in to make sure everyone gets one,” Proctor said. “Because if people panic … they’ll try to take as much as they can.” She’s also bracing for more people to need the pantry after a worse-than-average hunting season, she said. “A lot of people are dependent on elk and deer. But we have had this bluetongue disease and chronic wasting disease,” she said. Regardless of when SNAP returns, food pantry staff say there will be a continual need for donations. When donating food, Jones said, it’s especially helpful to buy flats of one staple instead of shopping for one imagined family. “Get about two things, but multiples of it. Get two or three flats of jelly and get a case of cornbread mix and bring that in,” she said. “Because what you’ve done is you have just filled the gap, and you’ve provided a more egalitarian choice for food pantries.” Jones also noted that pantries will be especially in need of donations in the new year. “People get very generous over the holidays and we really appreciate it,” she said. “People get burnt out through the holidays and by January most of the shelves start looking a little bit empty.” Most food pantries also take monetary donations to buy foods they need directly, which can help with filling unexpected needs, especially when needs are hard to predict.

    "title": "Joseph (Joe) Milazzo",
    "text": "Birth: 1934 Death: 2025 Joseph (“Joe”) Salvatore Milazzo passed away on October 23, 2025, one day after his 91st birthday, surrounded in love by his daughters. Born in Pittston, Pennsylvania, Joe spent the last 46 years of his life in Anaheim, California — a place he grew to love and call home. Joe was devoted to his family. He was married to his adoring wife, Anna Marie, for many years before she passed away almost six years ago. Together they built a loving home filled with warmth, laughter, and countless memories. She was the love of his life. He is survived by his daughters, Barbara Webright and Joanne Mizell, and their husbands, John Webright and Gary Mizell; his grandson, Cody Webright; his stepsons, David Spinney and Bill Spinney; and two grandchildren from his marriage to Anna Marie, Austin Spinney and Allison Rodriguez. Joe is also lovingly remembered by his nephew, Sam Milazzo; great-nephew, Jason Milazzo; great-niece, Jen Kanehl; and nieces Alice Milazzo and Sue Doty. His youngest daughter, Cathy, sadly passed away early in life, and we know they are now reunited in Heaven. Joe proudly served his country as a veteran of the Korean War. After his military service, he dedicated his life to education as a teacher in the Anaheim School District. He touched the lives of countless students over the years — not just through lessons, but through kindness, patience, and genuine care. He was a man of community and connection. Joe was a longtime member of St. Norbert Catholic Church in Orange and found joy in faith and fellowship. He was also a member of the Long Beach Speakers Club, where he shared his love of words, humor, and storytelling. He enjoyed fellowship and service as a member of First Friday Friars club. Outside of work, Joe had many passions. He loved to entertain and was always known as the most gracious and generous host. He was an avid tennis player well into his eighties and loved the energy and camaraderie of the game. He was also a voracious reader — finishing two or three books every week — always curious, always learning. Some of Joe’s happiest moments were spent right at home, sitting on his patio surrounded by friends and family, enjoying good conversation and a good cigar. He enjoyed a competitive game of Skip-Bo with family after dinner. Those simple, meaningful moments were what he treasured most. Joe was known for his generosity, his thoughtfulness, and his gentle spirit. He had a nurturing heart and was always looking after others. His weekly breakfasts with lifelong friends were a cherished tradition that lasted decades, filled with laughter and stories that only grew better with time. He was, in every sense, both a gentleman and a gentle man — kind, considerate, and full of quiet strength. Though Joe will be deeply missed, his love, wisdom, and warmth will continue to live on in all who were lucky enough to call him family and friend. Viewing will take place from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm on November 17, 2025, at Hilgenfeld Mortuary in Anaheim, California. A memorial Mass will be held at 10:00 a.m. on November 18 at St. Norbert Catholic Church in Orange, California. Send Flowers Plant a Tree Send a Meal",

    "text": "Birth: 1955 Death: 2025 Patrick M Mehtonen peacefully passed away October 28, 2025 in Ukiah. He was born on November 25, 1955.  Pat is survived by friends and hunting buddies who have been enriched by his life and love for his ranch. He was preceded in death by his sister, Marsha; mother, Wanda Burke Mehtonen and father, Marcus Mehtonen. Pat grew up as a traditional Mendocino County rancher. Raising sheep, hunting, riding horses, and living off the land as much as possible. Over the years, as it became harder to make a living on sheep alone, he was able to turn his passion for hunting into a livelihood. Never one to need luxury, he lived his entire life on his ranch where he considered it the greatest place on Earth, constantly working to keep everything running as only a rancher could.  He was tough as nails, never complained, and could fix anything with baling wire and whatever he could find laying around. He didn’t just love his ranch  it was his life and his legacy, having begun as a homestead by his maternal grandfather William P. Burke in the late 1800s. According to family lore, the Burke’s were the first people to find a way to bring a covered wagon into Ukiah Valley. That toughness and determination was a trait Pat certainly inherited. His greatest joy was spending time at his cabin, eating, drinking, hunting, laughing, and sharing memories and experiences with anyone who would join him. Although he never had children of his own, being a father figure came naturally to him. He was a role model to many, and everyone who spent time with him learned how to enjoy a simplified life. His sense of humor and spontaneity was always on full display and a joy to be around. The Mehtonen Ranch will live on and be a place to carry on the tradition of his family  his biggest ambition. Pat’s one-of-a-kind personality, humor, jokes, and love for his ranch and hunting will forever be missed and never forgotten. So many cherished memories to reflect upon. A celebration of life will be hosted by the Crudo family at Mike & Teresa Crudo’s home on Sunday, November 16th at one o’clock. Bring your stories and photos to share.

    "title": "Eagles vs Packers Predictions - Early Picks & Odds for Monday Night Football Week 10",
    "text": "Ponnaiya's prediction: Hurts delivers at Lambeau. The Philadelphia Eagles lock horns with the Green Bay Packers in Monday Night Football in Week 10. The Eagles are fresh off their bye after back-to-back wins, while the Pacers are coming off an upset loss on Sunday. My early Eagles vs. Packers predictions are expecting a lower-scoring game while backing Philadelphia as a short road underdog. Here are my NFL picks for this Monday Night showdown. Here are our early thoughts on the spread and total for this week’s game. We will have a full game preview (with a best bet and SGP) later in the week. -110 at bet365 The Philadelphia Eagles are 6-2 and won back-to-back games before going on their bye in Week 9. The week off should have allowed superstar running back Saquon Barkley and No. 1 wide receiver A.J. Brown to recover from niggling injuries. Philadelphia's offense is trending in the right direction. Jalen Hurts has completed 71.1% of his passes for 1068 yards with 10 touchdowns and one pick over the last four games. Meanwhile, Barkley finally broke out with 150 rushing yards in Week 8. The Green Bay Packers were 13.5-point favorites last week but ended up falling 16-13 to the Panthers. They lost tight end Tucker Kraft to a season-ending injury in that game, which is yet another blow to a banged-up receiver group. Quarterback Jordan Love has been trying to do too much, which has resulted in holding on to the ball too long and some bad throws. With so many of his top targets sidelined, he'll have a tough time throwing against a Philly D that is fourth in the league in opponent pass rating. Especially with the Eagles bolstering their pass rush by trading for Jaelen Phillips. -110 at bet365 With the season-ending injury to Kraft, Jayden Reed on the IR, and rookie wideout Matthew Golden dealing with a shoulder injury, Green Bay's offense will have a tough time moving the ball through the air. That said, the Packers have a strong pass defense themselves, ranking eighth in the league in defensive dropback success rate. They are allowing just 16.3 ppg at home, and even in last week's upset loss to the Panthers, their defense showed up. These teams will have to lean on their rushing attacks if they want to move the chains on Monday. That will be even more emphasized in a cold-weather game with temperatures expected to be close to freezing at Lambeau. Both offenses play at a slow tempo, with Green Bay 26th in the league in seconds per play and Philadelphia 30th. That sluggish pace and a reliance on running the ball should lead to the clock getting chewed up and the Under cashing.

    "title": "Sticker shock? Wyomingites could see skyrocketing bills on ACA health insurance marketplace",
    "text": "When the Affordable Care Act marketplace, where roughly 42,000 Wyoming residents get their health insurance, opened enrollment Saturday, customers likely faced a double whammy: higher prices and fewer resources. The landscape looks different this year between federal changes to the marketplace’s administration and the ongoing government shutdown — caused in part by a deadlock over ACA tax credits designed to make insurance cheaper for consumers. As things stand, consumers are generally experiencing less help in navigating the system, seeing higher premium costs for plans and facing new reporting requirements. In some cases, people could find their health insurance costs spiking by thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars annually. Wyomingites have two months to shop for a plan before open enrollment closes Jan. 15. WyoFile reached out to experts and gathered information and tips for residents to keep in mind through the process: The Affordable Care Act marketplace is available to people who don’t qualify for Medicaid and don’t have insurance through an employer. Open enrollment is the annual window when individuals and families can sign up for health insurance through the ACA, adjust their plans or cancel coverage. Price jumps aren’t uncommon as insurers do raise premiums over time, but this year those increases will be larger due to the expiration of some enhanced premium tax credits. “Health insurance has always been and continues to be very, very expensive,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor with Georgetown’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. “But going into 2026, it’s only going to get more expensive.” The tax credits were created in 2021 to essentially lower monthly out-of-pocket costs for ACA consumers, in some cases, all the way to $0. Congress did not extend them in the One Big Beautiful Bill in July, and an attempt to extend them now is one of the factors driving the government shutdown. The average ACA marketplace consumer will likely pay about 100% more for coverage in 2026, according to a fact sheet from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. In Wyoming, the impacts will vary depending on income, demographics and other factors. According to Healthy Wyoming, a 60-year-old couple with an annual income of $82,000 will face an increase of $37,422 in annual health care costs due to the tax credit loss. The premium increase for a 45-year-old who earns $62,000 annually could be upwards of $6,000. In the past, health “navigators” — professionals who guide customers through what can be a confusing open enrollment process — have been available largely thanks to federal funds. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, however, slashed that funding by 90% this year. As a result, Enroll Wyoming, which offered free navigator help to those looking for insurance, experienced a significant budget cut. Despite paring down its staff from 10 individuals to just one full-time and one part-time employee, Enroll Wyoming will still offer services. “Enroll Wyoming stresses that it will be still around to educate and empower consumers,” reads an August press release. The nonprofit will have more emphasis on online and phone communication in its new iteration, the release says. “At the same time, Enroll Wyoming is building a statewide network of partners to provide more referral support.” Consumers will also have fewer options. Mountain Health Co-op announced in August that it will no longer offer health plans in Wyoming at the end of the year. That means Wyoming will be down to just two providers. Finally, people should brace for more paperwork, Corlette said. That can include filing extra forms or submitting paperwork to reflect any changes in income. Enrollment opened Saturday. To get coverage starting Jan. 1, consumers must enroll in a plan by Dec. 15. If they enroll between Dec. 15 and the closing date of Jan. 15, coverage will start Feb. 1. If people are already enrolled and do nothing, they will be automatically re-enrolled in their plans. The ACA marketplace only opened up what’s called “window shopping” two days before enrollment began, Corlette said, which means that it’s been hard for customers to suss out their new options. “Also, the federal government told insurance companies that for this year only, they don’t have to include premium information in the notices that they send to consumers, which usually go out in October,” she added. That could further veil price changes. “I can imagine some people will be taken by surprise,” she said. “This will be a uniquely challenging year.” First, Corlette said, they can contact their members of Congress to urge them to find more affordable solutions and let them know “the delay is not helping anyone.” Next, she said, they should stay informed. “If you see your premium is unaffordable, don’t lose hope. There is still a chance that Congress will strike a deal here and provide premium relief.” Folks can hold off until Dec. 15, Corlette noted; they don’t have to rush into anything. If they do decide to leave the marketplace and look elsewhere, Corlette said, they should have caution. “There’s a lot of junk out there and a lot of aggressive marketing, so just be careful,” she said, adding that using a local insurance broker who can meet in person is generally a good way to help sort the quality plans from those that don’t offer much financial protection. What Corlette fears at this point is that “a lot of people will check their accounts, see their premium, get sticker shock, and say, ‘I can’t afford this,’ and walk away. “And once they walk away, it’s really, really hard to get them to come back,” she said. “I think there’s still time for Congress to act, but probably too late to be sure that everybody stays insured.” If people opt out of marketplace insurance, it would likely trigger even more cost increases. According to BlueCrossBlueShield Wyoming, when healthier people leave the marketplace, those who remain often require more care. That drives up costs for everyone.

    "title": "Murphy's Taproom closes after 19 years in Manchester",
    "text": "Murphy’s Taproom on Elm Street in Manchester is permanently closed. Murphy’s Taproom has been a mainstay of Elm Street in Manchester since it took over the Omega Entertainment Complex in 2007. Now, it’s no more after the owners decided to consolidate operatons at their Bedford facility. The Irish-themed restaurant and pub closed at the end of last month. Keith Murphy opened the joint after working as a manager at The Derryfield restaurant and at a restaurant in Baltimore. The taproom later expanded, and Murphy added a diner after purchasing a vacant auto mechanic’s shop. Murphy later sold the diner. Murphy, who serves as a state senator representing Manchester’s Ward 1, said it was tough to close a restaurant he invested in for 19 years. “It was a successful long run,” Murphy said. “Nineteen years is a lifetime in the restaurant business.” He said the “old saying is half of them don’t make it the first year.” He admits he doesn’t know if it’s true or not. Murphy’s owns its spot in Bedford while it rented in Manchester all these years. “When we looked at what made sense in the long term, the building that we owned made a lot more sense,” he said. The growth of new apartments in and around Manchester didn’t necessarily translate into new business, especially a place that made 50% of its profit on alcohol with trends showing people are drinking less in recent years. Pizza, burgers, and beers paid the bills. The Bedford location opened in 2017 after the team behind Murphy’s bought the Weathervane Seafood Restaurant on Route 101 in Bedford and tore it down. The venue includes a function hall. Unlike Manchester, which serves homemade bar food, Bedford has more high-end options, such as steak and seafood dishes. No changes are on the horizon for the Bedford location. “What we are doing in Bedford works very good for us,” Murphy said. “We have been busier and busier and our trendline is very good for us.” The closure of the Manchester location also made sense for Murphy’s family life. He hopes regulars will make the trek to Bedford. “For us it was a simple math equation,” Murphy said. “The place in Bedford is very busy and we’re home by 9 p.m. most nights.” jphelps@unionleader.com Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

    "title": "The Slot machine is up and running again as record-equalling Liverpool sink Real",
    "text": "Alexis Mac Allister's second-half header proved decisive as a revitalised Liverpool deservedly defeated Real Madrid 1-0 at Anfield to equal a Champions League record. In a closely-contested first half with chances at both ends of the field, one controversial moment stood out - one that went against the Premier League champions. The Reds were first awarded a free kick when Dominik Szoboszlai's shot struck Aurelien Tchouameni's hand right on the line, but after a pitchside review, Liverpool were not given a penalty, but the handball call itself was overturned. The home faithful would have felt that justice was served just past the hour mark, though, as one of the smallest men on the pitch - Mac Allister - beat the hitherto impenetrable Thibaut Courtois with a bullet header to break the deadlock. Arne Slot's steadfast defence quelled Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior expertly to trigger Anfield jubilation, and also equal the record for the most European Cup/Champions League wins over Real Madrid to nil with five, the same number as Juventus. Fifth-placed Real remain above Liverpool in the 36-team table, but only goal difference is keeping Los Blancos above the sixth-placed Reds, who have won back-to-back matches for the first time since September 23. We were not sure if Liverpool were back after their win over Aston Villa. Liverpool have just beaten Real Madrid, and quite convincingly at that. They are back. Tonight, the statistics and the eye test told the story on Merseyside, where the Reds generated 2.58 Expected Goals compared to Real's 0.45, and the 15-time European champions managed just two shots on target all evening long. Courtois was near-unbeatable in goal for most of the evening, but the ex-Chelsea shot-stopper was let down by his outfielders in white, and it was only too fitting for Mac Allister to grab the decisive goal and continue his redemption arc after a troubled start to the new term. Of course, the right-back dynamic cannot be ignored either; while Trent Alexander-Arnold watched on from the bench for most of the match and was then booed vociferously during his short time on the pitch, Conor Bradley had Vinicius in his pocket. Tuesday's loss was just Real's second in 15 matches this season, but Xabi Alonso's crop were inferior throughout, and the corner appears to have been well and truly turned for the Premier League holders. Was it a handball!? ? Liverpool are denied a penalty after VAR review ❌ pic.twitter.com/CLesyTkPDj What would Liverpool vs. Real Madrid be without a little bit of controversy? Referee Istvan Kovacs initially gives a free kick just outside the box for an Tchouameni handball before being summoned to the monitor, triggering cheers from expectant Liverpool fans. However, following a review, the Romanian decides that Tchouameni did not commit a handball offence after all. The home crowd thought their side were going to be awarded a penalty - they do not even get a free kick! Mac Allister breaks the deadlock! ? No saving that one for Courtois as Liverpool's pressure pays off ? pic.twitter.com/OFY3iTX2BY Courtois is beaten by a header from Mac Allister. Who had that one on their bingo card for tonight? Szoboszlai's outswinging free kick is drilled in to the mixer, and Mac Allister peels away from white shirts to steer a powerful header home into the roof of the net above Courtois's flailing arms. A VAR check briefly disrupts the hosts' celebrations, but Mac Allister is clearly being played onside by Jude Bellingham, and the goal stands. Thibaut Courtois is having a BLINDER vs Liverpool ? Where have we seen that before? ?⏮️ pic.twitter.com/Hz38Gm3gJS Picking a Real Madrid player for this award almost feels wrong, but just as he did in the 2021-22 UCL final, Courtois repelled Liverpool attack after Liverpool attack. The Belgian's efforts were in vain this time, but with eight saves, 10 recoveries, three successful run-outs and two clearances, Real Madrid would have easily lost by more were it not for one of the best goalkeepers of this generation. Possession: Liverpool 39%-61% Real Madrid Shots: Liverpool 17-8 Real Madrid Shots on target: Liverpool 9-2 Real Madrid Corners: Liverpool 4-2 Real Madrid Fouls: Liverpool 16-11 Real Madrid Florian Wirtz created five chances against Real Madrid in the first half. He's the first Liverpool player to do that in any game this season. #UCL pic.twitter.com/JKMnFPQTey Alexis Mac Allister has scored three Champions League goals for Liverpool. Two of them have come against Real Madrid at Anfield. ⚽️⚽️ pic.twitter.com/VZoxD7lXRj When the Champions League resumes in the final week of November, Liverpool welcome PSV Eindhoven to Anfield on November 26, the same night that Real Madrid are away to Olympiacos.

    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Daiyan Henley, a former Washington State star, started and played Sunday because football is his escape, and he needed that more than ever after the shooting death of his older brother. Henley came through with seven tackles, his third sack of the season, a tackle for loss and a quarterback hit in the Chargers’ 27-20 win over the Tennessee Titans. “Right now, I’m just floating and the only thing that’s consistent right now in my life, and this is crazy to say, is football,” Henley said after the game. “So for me, that’s why I’m out there is because this is the most consistent thing I’ve got in my life right now is football. And I’m just trying to make the most of it.” His older brother, Jabari, was killed Friday night in Los Angeles. Henley traveled with the Chargers and started. According to ESPN, Henley heard the news after he was awoken Saturday morning in his hotel room by teammate Denzel Perryman, who urged him to call his mother. “Being transparent, I dropped to my knees,” Henley said. Henley was the Chargers’ third-round pick in 2023 out of WSU, and he has started every game since the start of the 2024 season. Henley’s father is record executive Eugene “Big U” Henley who has worked with many prominent West Coast rappers, including Snoop Dogg, Kurupt and the late Nipsey Hussle. The elder Henley also helped produce and was featured in the 2021 FX documentary series “Hip Hop Uncovered.” His father also is a former gang leader who was arrested in a drug sting and served 12 years of a 23-year sentence. The Chargers linebacker posted “Love you big bro” on social media after the game. It’s been a challenging year for Henley who played through illness in a 20-9 win over the Las Vegas Raiders in the second game of the season. He said the Chargers’ organization has been there for him from ownership on down, and Henley credited coach Jim Harbaugh with being there for him repeatedly. “He’s probably been the first call I’ve gotten for every situation,” Henley said. “He’s been there, right there and just told me, keep my head down, keep grinding, keep working, and try to stay consistent.”",

    "text": "Birth: 1936 Death: 2025 Frank Wyatt Dunn, a man whose hands shaped more than just tools and machines, passed away peacefully on October 25, 2025, at the age of 89. His life was defined not only by what he built, but by how he built it–with care, integrity, and a deep sense of purpose. Born on February 18, 1936, Frank was a natural builder. He could make, repair, and maintain almost anything–from farm equipment to household fixtures. But his true gift lay in constructing the foundations of lasting relationships, thriving businesses, and community organizations. His work was never just about the task at hand–it was about the people it served and the legacy it left behind. Frank spent forty years as the general manager of a leading agronomy research facility, where he oversaw pioneering efforts in selective breeding to improve crop resilience and yield. His leadership helped advance sustainable agriculture and supported generations of farmers and scientists. Though he once patented a clover harvester in 1978, a testament to his ingenuity, Frank’s life’s work was far broader. He was a lifelong member and leader of the Lions Club, where he served with distinction, including as District Governor in 1991. His service was marked by humility and a tireless commitment to helping others. Frank shared over 64 joyful years of marriage with his beloved wife, Marilee Dunn, who passed just six months before him. Their partnership was the cornerstone of a life filled with love, laughter, and shared purpose. He is survived by his two sons, Mike and David; his daughter-in-law Cathy; his grandsons Ryan and Will; and Ryan’s wife, Jessa. Frank was eagerly awaiting the arrival of his first great-grandchild this coming February–a new life he hoped to welcome with the same warmth and wisdom he gave so freely. A celebration of Frank’s life will be held on Tuesday, November 25 at 12:00 PM at the Woodland Lion Banquet Hall. All who knew him are invited to gather and honor the man who built so much and gave even more. Frank led by example, touching and changing the lives of everyone he encountered. His legacy is not just in what he made, but in what he made possible. Send Flowers Plant a Tree Send a Meal",

    "text": "Late Limp Bizkit bassist Sam Rivers was found dead in a blood-stained bathroom earlier last month, according to a new report on Oct 30. Photo: TNS Late Limp Bizkit bassist Sam Rivers was found dead in a blood-stained bathroom earlier last month, according to a new report on Oct 30. Per a recording of the 911 call obtained by TMZ, a woman identified only as Keely told a dispatcher she discovered Rivers “face first in a pile of blood” in a bathroom at his Florida home. She can be heard attempting to perform CPR during the call as she sobs into the phone. Responding officers from the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Department also performed CPR before paramedics arrived and pronounced Rivers dead. The 48-year-old musician appeared to have a cut above his eye, suggesting he may have suffered a fall, according to an incident report also obtained by TMZ. A deputy noted Rivers’ face and neck were blue – common symptoms of a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot that blocks and stops blood flow to the lungs. However, his cause of death has still not been determined. It was previously reported that Rivers was under medical care at home at the time of his death. According to the incident report, Keely told deputies that Rivers underwent a liver transplant in 2018 and was taking related medication. He temporarily left Limp Bizkit in 2015 after developing liver disease from years of excessive drinking. “I had to leave Limp Bizkit in 2015 because I felt so horrible, and a few months after that I realised I had to change everything because I had really bad liver disease,” Rivers told author Jon Wiederhorn for his book Raising Hell. “I got treatment for the alcohol and got a liver transplant, which was a perfect match,” he said. He returned to the band in 2018, the same year as his transplant. Rivers co-founded Limp Bizkit in the 1990s alongside frontman Fred Durst. Several of the band’s songs have seen a recent surge in streams, including 1999’s Break Stuff, which topped Billboard’s Hot Hard Rock Songs list just this week. As of Oct 30, Limp Bizkit was still slated to embark on their Central and South American Gringo Papi tour, kicking off Nov 29 in Mexico City. The seven-date, seven-country tour is scheduled to end Dec 20 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. – New York Daily News/Tribune News Service Thank you for your report!",

    "text": "Palo Alto, California, Nov.  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Point, the leading home equity investment platform making homeownership more valuable and accessible, and funds managed by Blue Owl Capital (“Blue Owl”) announced today that they have completed a rated securitization of Point’s Home Equity Investment (“HEI”) assets, issuing $390 million of rated asset-backed securities (the “Transaction”), marking Point’s third securitization of 2025 and continuing the firm’s record of programmatic issuance. The Transaction closed on October 28th, 2025. The issuer, Point Securitization Trust 2025-2, issued $254.2 million of senior class A-1 securities rated A (low) (sf), $46.6 million of mezzanine class A-2 securities rated BBB (low) (sf), $45.9 million of subordinate class B-1 securities rated BB (low) (sf), and $43.3 million of subordinate class B-2 securities rated B (high) (sf) (retained), all rated by Morningstar DBRS. A portion of the notes was acquired by accounts managed by an affiliate of Blue Owl. The Transaction attracted 29 unique investors, including eight new entrants to the Point securitization platform, resulting in over $1.6 billion in orders, and underscoring the continued institutional interest and confidence in Point’s program. Co-sponsoring the Transaction with a subsidiary of Blue Owl, Point was the originator of all the HEIs in the securitization and will continue to service the assets. In addition to complying with U.S. credit risk retention rules, the Transaction is the first HEI securitization to include undertakings related to both the EU Securitization Regulation and the UK Securitization Framework, as well as the transparency requirements of the EU Securitization Regulation. These steps further position Point’s securitization platform to meet the standards of European and UK institutional investors, reflecting Point’s commitment to broadening global access to the HEI market. “Building on the strong momentum of PNT 25-1, this transaction reflects growing confidence in home equity investments as a mainstream asset class,” said Eddie Lim, co-founder and CEO of Point. “As homeowners and investors continue to seek flexible, sustainable ways to unlock and deploy capital, Point is proud to lead with consistency, transparency, and execution.” Since pioneering the HEI category in 2015, Point has closed six securitizations and continues to set benchmarks for liquidity, scalability, and transparency in alternative home equity financing. “This marks the third transaction that Blue Owl has co-sponsored alongside Point. We were able to combine legacy seasoned collateral we acquired earlier this year with new originations purchased directly from Point to issue the largest public HEI securitization to date,” said Ivan Zinn, Head of Alternative Credit at Blue Owl. “Blue Owl and Point have a longstanding relationship dating back to 2018, and we are excited to continue working with the Point team.” Barclays Capital Inc. (“Barclays”) was the sole-structuring agent for the issuance. Barclays, Nomura Securities International Inc., and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. were joint bookrunners on the Transaction, and East West Markets, LLC and StoneX Financial Inc. were co-managers on the Transaction.

    "text": "Birth: 1930 Death: 2025 Ellen Murdoch Wheeler entered into eternal rest on Tuesday, October 28th, 2025 in Portage, Indiana. She is survived by her children, Ellen Ann Lopiano, Janet M. Wheeler, and Scott M. Wheeler; 15 grandchildren, 22 great-grandchildren, and 2 great-great-great-grandchildren. She was preceded in death by her beloved husband of 49 years, Arthur J. Wheeler, and two sons, Stephen A. Wheeler and Mark E. Wheeler. Born to Scottish immigrant parents, Archibald and Margaret B. Murdoch of Warwick, Rhode Island, she was the youngest of five. She aspired to become a seamstress and was a part-time secretary at Brown University. This changed when she met her husband, Arthur, a volunteer fireman and eventual sheet metal worker. The couple were wed in the living room of Ellen’s childhood home on July 2nd, 1949. After starting their family, they moved to Orange County, California. Ellen embraced life as a homemaker, mother, and devout Christian. Later, Ellen joined the ranks of the Yorba Linda mail carriers as one of their first female mailmen. After retirement, the couple moved to Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Sadly, Arthur passed in 1998. Ellen chose to remain for three decades in Lake Havasu and was involved at St. Michael’s United Methodist Church. During this time, she also cared for her sister Janet Fisher and her adult son Stephen, both passed from dementia. She then moved to be with family, living briefly in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, before settling in Indiana with her daughter, Janet, and grandson Frank Spennato. Reading and cryptograms were Ellen’s favorite pass times. She could buy out a bookstore. Ellen also continued to sew and knit. Her children and grandchildren could often be found wearing the latest Ellen fashion. Ellen was known as a spitfire, a straight shooter, and perhaps a little mischievous. She’d be the first to say she was no saint. But one thing was certain, everyone held deep respect for her. Above all, she was known for her love, because when she loved, she loved fiercely. A public memorial service will be held on Saturday, November 22nd at 2:00pm at St. Michael’s United Methodist Church in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. All are welcome. There will be a reception to follow in the church hall, and flowers are appreciated. Please RSVP to ellenwheelermemorial@gmail.com if you plan to attend by November 15th.

    "title": "Rock legend Jim Messina to play solo show at Flying Monkey",
    "text": "PLYMOUTH — Rock 'n' roll legend Jim Messina has been on the cover of the Rolling Stone, played with the likes of Neil Young and Stephen Stills in Buffalo Springfield, and formed one of the top duos of the 1970s with Loggins and Messina. But sometimes it isn’t the fame and fortunate that drives a musician, but rather the love of creating tunes to stand the test of time, while still being inspired to make more. Messina will be joined by his band The Roadrunners on Thursday, Nov. 20, for an intimate show at the Flying Monkey Movie House & Performance Center, where he will play some brand-new material, as well as old favorites from his days with some of rock’s most influential groups. “I will be 78 on my next birthday, and when I look at when I started at 13, and where I am now, I think the greatest achievement is to maintain and continue working and making people happy who hear my music,” Messina said. “I never expected it.” Messina is a student of music, saying he is often up late educating himself on the ins and outs of production, and what makes certain sounds even possible. Recently, he was awake at 1 a.m., trying to understand power transformers and how to produce 300 volts. He is building his first guitar amplifier, saying he still studies, and figured, why not? Backtrack more than seven decades, and you’ll find the start of Messina’s musical career. He started playing the guitar when he was 5 years old, but it wasn’t until junior high school when he was buying singles and listening to The Champs, and things started to click. After playing a couple shows with neighborhood friends, with one essentially being a babysitting gig at a local country club, he formed a group called His Jesters, his first shot at success. At only 16, Messina was already making a name for himself as a lead guitarist. But he was also multi-talented, and desired for his production skills. He apprenticed under renowned audio engineer Mike Dorrough at the Bob Hudson-owned Emperor Productions in southern California, and suddenly he was learning how to produce, and worked with acclaimed drummer Earl Palmer and bassist Joe Osborne. “These guys were so good,” Messina said. “I thought, they could read music like it was fly paper.” He and Dorrough partnered to start building studios around Hollywood, and down the line was recommended for engineering gigs at places like Sunset Sound. One day, his manager asked if he was available for a demo. Messina showed up the next morning, set up a microphone, and, wanting ambiance, he moved in a lava lamp. The lights went down, and a singer/songwriter came in. It was the first time he ever had visuals from the music being sung. That singer was Joni Mitchell, and her work was being produced by none other than David Crosby, who ultimately went to Neil Young to tell him about this producer working at Sunset Sound who could help him with a new project: Buffalo Springfield. “I was the engineer for their second album, and the third album I was asked to produce the band, and I got the job,” he said. When Buffalo Springfield lost their bass player, the band held auditions, and Messina decided to give it a shot, despite mainly being a guitarist. He had already received some pointers from Osborne while building his studio, and he said the tricks he was shown worked, because Young was impressed by what he heard. “There were 13 of us, and I was the last one. And I got about eight bars in, and I got a look from Neil,” he said. “It was like, 'Whoa, this guy knows the songs.' Why wouldn’t I know them?” Messina said Buffalo Springfield “were great cats, but sometimes like herding cats.” These were budding rock stars, with Young and Stephen Stills on their way to being some of the most successful around. After Buffalo Springfield disbanded, Messina and guitarist Richie Furay decided to form the band Poco, which really started in 1967, while Buffalo Springfield was still around, playing the Furay-penned song “Kind Woman.” Poco was short lived, from 1968 until Halloween of 1970, but this opened the door for perhaps Messina's greatest successful venture. “I had just left Poco, and had conversations with people at CBS about [Kenny] Loggins, who they were considering signing,” Messina said. “Kenny and I met before Christmas, and made that decision to start working together at the beginning of 1971.” Messina said he interviewed Loggins, and discovered he didn’t even own a guitar, and showed up without any tapes of his material. He knew Loggins had talent, but there was some work to be done. They started tinkering with what would become a couple of their biggest hits, “Danny’s Song” and “House on Pooh Corner,” and despite not being much of a rock 'n' roll repertoire, Messina saw something special in Loggins. “I believed in Kenny because of his voice,” Messina said. “He had this ability to sing other styles of music, because he loved them so much.” Messina called music producer Clive Davis, sent him some tapes, and while he liked what he heard, noticed Messina was doing a lot of the playing. Messina was tired of touring and had no intention of hitting the road, but Davis questioned who would take his place. “I figured I would help support his first tour and show him the ropes, see how things went, and I would jump off after the first tour, when he was established,” Messina said. “Clive didn’t like that idea.” Davis said too many great bands get together and break up after the first album, but in this case, he decided Messina could just sit in. The idea was to bring Loggins out first for acoustic, followed by Messina playing some country rock, then the two joining forces. The debut album, Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina “Sittin’ In,” was an instant success, and after some back and forth on a name for the duo, they went with Loggins and Messina. “Suddenly, Loggins and Messina became one of the best selling duos at that time,” Messina said. Loggins and Messina was a force between 1971 and 1976, selling more than 16 million records, with huge hits led by “Your Mama Don’t Dance,” which reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Now years later, Messina recalls times many could not even dream of. He played at storied venues like Carnegie Hall, Madison Square Garden, and Jones Beach, and said when he looks back at some of these moments, it was like he didn’t realize it was happening, as it was a whirlwind. But his greatest achievement of all was starting to play music as a teenager, and still putting out new material at age 78. “I still feel very inspired every day when I get up,” Messina said. “I have been able to maintain that interest in what I do. When I was 11 or 12, I said I wanted to know this business from the register up to the legalese. This has been what my life has been.” Fans at the Flying Monkey will be able to hear material off his new album “Here, There and Everywhere,” which he released with his new band The Roadrunners. But there will be plenty from his days putting out legendary songs with equally legendary artists. “What I work to do is make sure we have songs and arrangements that people have heard and enjoyed over their lifetime, and keep those arrangements to sound as close to the original as possible,” he said. “I believe that is important.” Log In Keep it Clean.

    "title": "Debating 2026 Yankees with big changes ... maybe Steven Kwan, Robert Suarez",
    "text": "The World Series is over and it’s hot stove time. First up are the GM meetings, which will be held in Las Vegas next week. It’s very early into the offseason, but we do know the Yankees have roster holes to fill with nine free agents counting Cody Bellinger, who has already opted out of his deal. The Bombers need a center fielder with Trent Grisham and Bellinger on the market. Will they make sure one of them returns? Will they lose both, choose not to spend aggressively and raise the curtain on prospect Spencer Jones after a 35-homer, 25-steal season in the minors? The Yankees also need relievers. Devin Williams and Luke Weaver, both free agents, have one foot out the door. Bench players are on the shopping list, too. What should the Yankees do? This is the subject of the latest Yankees roundtable with beat writer Randy Miller and baseball columnist Bob Klapisch: Klapisch: This is the time of the year that I’m convinced fans love most. It feels like the temperature of the Hot Stove has been climbing steadily, season after season. It starts with the GM Meetings. The interesting part is that nothing actually gets done at these meetings. They are entirely preliminary. Brian Cashman, for example, won’t be proposing trades. What he does is have generic, abstract discussions with the GMs that he gets along with best, the GMs that he knows will be honest with him. He’ll say, ‘Hey, what are you looking for? Here’s what I need. Why don’t you think about A, B and C and I’ll see if I can match up with what you’re after. Let’s stay in touch.’ That’s how it usually goes in early November. That’s when the clock starts ticking. The Winter Meetings in December is when it all starts to become real. But next week, it’s just touching base, seeing who’s out there, and who’s prepared to move aggressively. Miller: Outfield has to be the Yankees’ biggest need. I know they think Jones is ready, but his strikeout rate was 35.4 percent this year and 36.8 percent in 2024. Both were higher than Yankees third baseman Ryan McMahon’s MLB-high 32.3 rate this past season. Can the Yankees go into next season with Jones in center and Jasson Dominguez in left? I doubt it. What I would do is try to bring back Bellinger to play center or try to make a trade with the Guardians for Steven Kwan to play left. Kwan is probably attainable because he’s two years away from free agency and projected to make $8.8 million next season. The Guardians don’t pay anyone other than Jose Raminez, so Kwan probably gets moved. If the Yankees get Kwan, Dominguez or Jones probably goes to Cleveland and the other starts in center. Kwan would be a great Yankees fit. He’d give them a true leadoff hitter to bat in front of Aaron Judge. He’s also won four Gold Gloves in the last four years. Klapisch: I’ve been told by people familiar with Cashman’s thinking that the Yankees are ready to commit to Jones if Bellinger doesn’t come back. Jones strikes out a lot, but that’s not a deal breaker. The Yankees have seen progression in other areas. Obviously he has the power. He has the size. He has the defensive skill. He has the charisma and personality for New York. He checks so many boxes that I strongly suspect he’ll be plan B if Bellinger walks. Miller: What’s unknown is whether the Yankees will pay the market rate to keep Bellinger. They love him, but they’re also are very high on Dominguez and Jones. They think both can be stars. They also need some lower-payroll players to balance out all of their many big-salary stars. Klapisch: I believe Bellinger will sign with another club and so do a lot of people around the around the big leagues. Remember, he’s represented by Scott Boras. We know what that means. Miller: I’m hearing Bellinger could get $180 million for six years, maybe more than $200 million for seven. If the Yankees make that kind of commitment, there is no spot for Jones or Dominguez. But I don’t think Bellinger is back unless it’s a team-friendly contract in years, and that’s not happening. Boras will make sure of that. Klapisch: People hire Boras for one reason only, and that’s to make the last-possible dollar regardless of what uniform you end up wearing. So just keep that in mind. The Yankees learned their lesson from their pursuit of Juan Soto last year. They thought they made a great offer, only to be outbid at the last minute by Steve Cohen and the Mets. My sense is that Yankees are wary of Boras using the same playbook with Bellinger: use Hal Steinbrenner to jack up the price and move him elsewhere. I don’t think the Yankees want to be party to that for a second year in a row. Miller: Would you consider packaging Dominguez or Jones for Kwan? I would. To me, Kwan is another Brett Gardner, maybe even a little better. Just look at Kwan’s stats for the last two years, .292 with 14 homers and 12 steals in 2024, .272 with 11 homers and 21 steals in 2025. The Yankees scored the most runs in the majors last season and could be a better offense next year with a lineup starting with Kwan, Judge and Ben Rice, then Giancarlo Stanton, Jazz Chisholm and Dominguez or Jones hitting fourth through sixth. Klapisch: I would try to get Kwan. I have a lot of enthusiasm for Dominguez’s upside. I still think he’s going to have a good career, but I don’t think necessarily it’s going to happen in New York. He probably would be a very good player for the Guardians. The Yankees need contact hitters like Kwan. They need hitters who don’t just put the ball in play, but ones who will frustrate pitchers and drive up their pitch counts … foul ball, foul ball, foul ball. That’s how the Blue Jays ended the Yankees’ season. The Yankees need a lineup that bears some resemblance to Toronto’s. Kwan fits that profile. Miller: Let’s move on to the bullpen. Their best high-leverage arms are the two closers they acquired last summer, David Bednar and Camilo Doval. That’s not enough. The way baseball is now, you really have to load up on bullpen arms because starters are often pulled in the fifth and sixth innings. What I’d do is make a big play for Robert Suarez, who is opting out of the final two years of his Padres contract after leading the NL with 40 saves this year. Mets closer Edwin Diaz also is opting out, but his price will higher, probably $20 million a year minimum. The Yankees won’t play that. Suarez turns 35 on March 1, so he’ll come a lot cheaper than Diaz, who will be 32 in March. Klapisch: It won’t cost a lot of money to reinvest in Weaver. I’d roll the dice on him again, but I am concerned about the trendline. His ERA in September was almost 10, and as you saw in the playoffs, he literally couldn’t get anybody out. Scouts have told me he was tipping pitches. The Yankees themselves said he was tipping pitches, and they were actually upset that he didn’t take that warning to heart. He was doing it all year, and didn’t do enough to clean up his delivery. Gerrit Cole worked with Weaver, but not even the counsel of a future Hall of Famer corrected the problem. It all reached a crescendo in October. Scouts also have told me that Weaver subtly changed his mechanics after his hamstring injury. He only missed three weeks, but never was quite the same. His velocity was down and the life on his fastball that he had in 2024 was gone. It’s fair to ask if that signature four-seamer is ever coming back. Miller: That’s a concern. Klapisch: It is a concern because pitchers usually start on the downward trend in their late 20s, especially power pitchers like Weaver. Once the decline begins, it only accelerates from there. But if I’m the GM, I still might try to bring Weaver back because he’s not going to cost a lot of money. He’s going to be a heck of a lot less than it would cost to sign Diaz, the best reliever available, I predict Diaz is going back to the Mets. I’d go for Suarez, too. You might be able to get him for half of Diaz’s price. Miller: I’m not so sure Weaver is going to be a cheap re-sign. I’m hearing he could get three years and $27-to-30 million. I think I’d pass at that price. Here’s another relief option that I like, a trade option. The Rays probably will be looking to move closer Pete Fairbanks, who’s got a club option for $11 million. Look for the Rays to pick up the option, then make a trade. I like Fairbanks. He’s pitched a lot of big games for some good Rays teams that made the playoffs. Klapisch: Fairbanks has been tormenting the Yankees for years, so it’s obvious he’s capable of pitching under pressure and in the New York spotlight. That’s the mistake the Yankees made with Devin Williams, who didn’t quite have the temperament for this market. So for sure Williams is out. It just goes to show that good relief pitchers who look tempting from afar don’t always work out. But I agree Fairbanks would be a great pickup. I would make that move. Miller: The Yankees need to get a right-handed hitting catcher, too. They had three lefties last year — Austin Wells, J.C. Escarra and Rice. I don’t think Rice is a catcher. He had no starts there in the playoffs because Wells is so much better receiving. Put Rice on first base every day. He might hit his way to the All-Star Game next summer and he might also improve from below average to average defensively concentrating on one position. Klapisch: So who are you looking at in terms of a right-handed hitting catcher? A-Rod was particularly critical of the Yankees on this very point. Miller: J.T. Realmuto would fill that need, but it’s doubtful the Yankees would go for him. I think more likely options are two other free agents, Danny Jansen and Christian Vazquez. Another possibility is Twins catcher Ryan Jeffers, who could be moved this winter. Jeffers’ power is intriguing and he feasts on left-handed pitching, but he does not have a great arm, is not a great blocker, nor is an accomplished framer. I like Vasquez. His average over the last three seasons is just .215, but he could be really good for the Yankees’ pitching staff and an excellent mentor to Wells. Klapisch: The potential hunt for another catcher is fueled by the disappointment with Wells’ lack of development. I thought he was going to be a much better hitter than he was this season. By the end of the year it felt like he’d become a near-automatic out. I still think there’s unrealized potential there, and I bet the Yankees could live with Wells if they woke up Anthony Volpe and Ryan McMahon at the bottom of the order. Those three - Wells, Volpe and McMahon - were like a black hole. I’m not sure bringing in a right-handed catcher is a must if you can rachet up the production elsewhere in that lineup. Miller: Moving on, the Yankees also have to redo their bench. As of now, Jose Caballero is their top extra player and he’s probably going to begin the season as the starting shortstop with Volpe out for the first month or so. They’ll also have Oswaldo Cabrera, who’s coming back from his broken leg. Klapisch: If we’re talking about changes, then the Yankees have to wean themselves off their home run addiction. That culture works for superstars like for Judge, Bellinger and Stanton, but it also undermines other hitters in that lineup, specifically Volpe. The Yankees absolutely have to go back to a contact-first philosophy. The Blue Jays did that in the Division Series. If the Yankees didn’t learn a lesson from that, then I don’t know what their future is. There has to be a change in the way they score runs and the way they attack opposing pitchers. Miller: I agree, but I don’t see the Yankees’ culture changing unless they make some drastic move. You want to upend the culture? Bring in Kwan. Trade McMahon and Chisholm for other strong defensive infielders who put the ball in play more. I know it’s unlikely, but a couple blockbusters is what the Yankees might need to finally win another World Series.

    "title": "Where is Kanye West? Inside mystery of rapper's disappearance",
    "text": "Kanye West, a name once dominated headlines and social media feeds,  has been vanished for months. Where is he? Earlier this year, he stormed X (formerly Twitter) with his unfiltered thoughts, made a controversial red carpet appearance with wife Bianca Censori, and dropped some new songs. Every word he said became a headline but lately there’s been nothing. No new music, no paparazzi sightings, no cryptic posts instead just an eerie silence from him. According to fans’ wild theories the rapper, who now goes by the name Ye, has either retreated into complete isolation, working in secret or building a new creative empire or he’s just simply done, burned out or finally choosing silence after years of chaos? One thing is certain, the 24-Grammys winner knows how to stay in the headlines and might love being the center of attention so his absence feels deliberate. How can the man who once fed on the energy of public attention now seem to be starving the world of his presence? Although Censori, with whom Ye got married in 2022, has been back in the spotlight promoting her new fashion line, the Yeezy founder is still nowhere to be seen. She made her Instagram comeback in October after a few-month hiatus and was recently spotted out and about. Ye, who’s no stranger to doing anything to stay trending, might have stepped back from the spotlight to amplify the yearning and reach for his upcoming music release. Considering the pre-release chaos of his previous albums including Yeezus and Donda, it wouldn’t be the first time he would turn mystery into marketing. The 48-year-old record producer and fashion designer's album rollouts have always carried an element of chaos,  secret sessions, leaks and cryptic teasers. So far his social media accounts have been dead, with his last Instagram post dating back to July 1. A post shared by Ye (@ye) Maybe this isn’t a disappearance but the calm before Atlanta-born artist's next cultural storm because in his world, silence often means something is brewing. While nothing through official channels have been communicated Ye did drop a tiny yet gravely upsetting update. Despite hearing nothing from him recently, fans were counting down to the release of Bully on November 7, only for the Runaway singer to disappoint them with his move. Ye quietly pushed back Bully release date, which he first teased in late 2024, to December 12. Notably, his 12th solo studio album, which is his first after the 2022 Donda 2, has been delayed five times. The Heartless singer had first claimed that the album would come out on June 15, the birthday of his and ex wife Kim Kardashian’s daughter North West. However, it wasn't released then, and there was no official word either. He then released a few tracks on June 20, including Preacher Man, Beauty and the Beast, and DAMN. The Stronger hitmaker then released two more singles on July 4, which were Last Breath and Losing Your Mind and hinted at a July 25 release for the album, but it was delayed again. He then pushed the release date to September before Spotify started a countdown until November 7. However, the release has been pushed to December 12 now, as per the updated date on spotify The delay has only deepened the mystery that either he is perfecting the project, or is this another round of unpredictable Ye chaos? Whether it’s a strategy or simply chaos disguised as art, the world is once again waiting for Ye to break his silence and when he does, the noise will be impossible to ignore.",

    "title": "Cops poised for firework disorder as officers watch over Bonfire Night displays",
    "text": "Police are poised for any potential firework disorder in Edinburgh this evening with officers seen keeping a careful watch over displays in the capital. Cops in the city have been given additional powers to stop and search people and vehicles as they aim to tackle the widespread Bonfire Night disorder seen in previous years. On Wednesday night, as the festivities got into full swing, uniformed officers were seen watching on from street corners as fireworks were set off. While no early trouble had been reported in the area, police vans have been seen situated on streets throughout the city. Earlier we told how the force have implemented Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which also allows for the removal of any items believed to be used to conceal a person's identity. The powers same in from 3pm on November 5 and will be in place within the Niddrie, Muirhouse, Pilton, Moredun, Gracemount, Saughton, Sighthill and Longstone areas of the city. Police say that this will be used \"responsibly\" and only \"when justified to help prevent disorder and serious violence\". It comes after police promised a record level of resources to tackle Bonfire Night disorder. In 2023, some 62 police officers were injured in disorder around the fireworks season across Scotland. Edinburgh has been the centre of shocking scenes of carnage in recent years around Bonfire night with locals left terrified by masked youths running riot. Dispersal zones are now enforceable to help prevent anti-social behaviour and keep communities safe from October 31 to November 5 from 2pm to midnight every day, with officers given powers to take action where needed. The zones cover multiple parts of the city from north to south and east to west. Overall, fireworks offences have reduced, but an increased targeting of emergency services has prompted cops to promise a tougher crackdown this year. Frontline officers in Edinburgh will also be equipped with Body Worn Video, as the national roll-out of this technology continues in a bid to track down offenders. Chief Superintendent David Robertson, Divisional Commander for Edinburgh, said: \"The overwhelming majority of those within Edinburgh have enjoyed the celebrations of the last week in the proper spirit and I sincerely thank the public for their support of our policing operation to keep people safe during the Halloween and Bonfire Night periods. “Attacks on police officers, emergency service colleagues, and other vital services will not be tolerated. \"These offences have a significant detrimental impact on our communities and so we will be utilising the Section 60 powers where appropriate to ensure this evening is safe and enjoyable for everyone looking to celebrate.”",

    "title": "The FIFO CEO: Rail Loop boss commutes from Queensland",
    "text": "Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. The $900,000-a-year executive responsible for Melbourne’s most expensive infrastructure project commutes from Brisbane and is paid additional expenses to attend unscheduled meetings. Freedom of information documents released to The Age reveal the extraordinary arrangements to enable Suburban Rail Loop Authority chief executive Frankie Carroll to maintain a residence in Brisbane, fly in and out of his Big Build job, and bill taxpayers for flight costs when he is “recalled to duty”. Suburban Rail Loop Authority chief executive Frankie Carroll. This is an employment term used when staff are asked to work or return to the office outside their regular work hours. Carroll, who is on a remuneration package of between $900,000 and $909,999, has led the Allan government’s signature infrastructure project since 2021. This includes superannuation and accrued leave and other entitlements. While Carroll meets the cost of his regular commute himself, the documents show that taxpayers were charged when Carroll flew to Melbourne, where the rail loop authority is headquartered, to attend a conference. In another example of travel costs billed to taxpayers, a flight from Brisbane to Melbourne is attributed to a “meeting in Canberra” but no further detail is provided. The released documents show that since Carroll was headhunted to run the SRLA, he has taken more than 30 domestic flights funded by taxpayers. The flights suggest he divides his time evenly between Victoria and Queensland and sometimes flies directly to Sydney or Canberra from Brisbane for meetings and conferences. The value of the flights attributed to Carroll being “recalled to duty” is $3645 since 2021. Carroll’s decision to remain embedded in Brisbane has raised eyebrows internally given the importance of the rail loop as Victoria’s biggest infrastructure project. The Age has spoken to four government sources, speaking anonymously to avoid repercussions, who said it was widely known within the SRLA that Carroll spent a significant share of his time in Queensland. “He has mentioned to stakeholders in meetings that he is FIFO [fly-in, fly-out],” one said. Opposition major projects spokesman Matthew Guy said the situation was farcical. “The Suburban Rail Loop is just another example of the Big Build becoming Victorian taxpayers’ big bill,” he said. Touted by the Allan government as Australia’s largest housing project, the Suburban Rail Loop has been billed as a generational city-shaping venture vital to maintaining Melbourne’s liveability as it is estimated to become a city of about 9 million people in the 2050s. The first stage of the loop, SRL East, is an underground railway between Cheltenham and Box Hill and is expected to cost $34.5 billion. The north and west links, if built, would connect to Melbourne’s existing rail lines in a so-called hub and spoke system. Precincts above each station have been flagged as mini-CBDs in the suburbs, transformed into denser hubs for jobs, homes and educational facilities. Plans for the first six of these precincts are being assessed by a planning panel, and some areas have been slated for towers as high as 25 storeys. Infrastructure Australia has questioned the $34.5 billion estimated price tag and recommended new analysis, including an updated cost-to-benefit ratio. More than $20 billion of this figure remains unfunded, with Victoria committing to fund a third on its own, another third through charges on development and the final third from the Commonwealth. The Albanese government has pledged $2.2 billion so far. Infrastructure Australia has recommended against further commitments without more information on the project’s cost and the charges the state plans to use to pay for the loop. The SRLA’s latest report shows the chief executive’s salary rose from a range between $870,000 and $879,999 in the 2023-24 financial year to between $900,000 and $909,999 in 2024-25, roughly in line with inflation. Travel records show the rail loop authority has spent tens of thousands of dollars flying Carroll to Asia and Europe to woo companies to bid for work on the project. Trips to Dublin, Rome, Seoul, Paris and London, among others, were taken to ensure a “competitive market process”, the documents say, for the early stages of bidding for the SRL East project, which has been broken into multiple packages. These visits had the effect of “ultimately achieving value for money and best project outcomes”. All four international journeys began with flights from Brisbane. Carroll’s most extensive trip was in 2022, when he spoke to potential bidders for one of the largest SRL East contracts on offer, a “line-wide” package that is estimated to be worth at least $8 billion to $9 billion. He travelled to Singapore, South Korea, Ireland, Spain, Austria, France and Britain. He returned to Europe a year later to meet other companies that were “unable to accommodate meetings in late 2022’s compressed schedule”. TransitLinX – a group of companies comprising John Holland, RATP Dev, Alstom, KBR and WSP – is the preferred bidder for this contract, which involves building the trains used on the underground line, operating and maintaining the network, and fitting out the tunnels. More recently, Carroll travelled to London and Dublin to talk to global insurance agencies to discuss coverage for the project. A Suburban Rail Loop Authority spokesperson said: “The Suburban Rail Loop will slash travel times and cut congestion for busy families – while delivering 70,000 more homes within walking distance to jobs, healthcare, green open spaces and Australia’s largest universities. “Mr Carroll’s primary residence is in Melbourne, and he travels on the weekends to see his family at his own expense. “As we get on delivering one of Victoria’s largest and most complex infrastructure project, engaging directly with leading global construction companies, suppliers and operators is essential to secure the specialist expertise required to build this city-shaping project.” Carroll, originally from Ireland, moved to Brisbane in 2004 and has held a range of high-level government roles, including chief executive of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority and director-general for the state’s Department of Infrastructure, Local Government and Planning. He became Queensland’s under treasurer in 2019 but moved out of the job in 2020 following the resignation of the state’s former deputy premier Jackie Trad and allegations she had interfered in his appointment. A Crime and Corruption Commission report into the hiring released this year made no adverse findings against Carroll but was critical of Trad’s “aggressive” advocacy that he be appointed. She has rejected the accusations in the report and no prosecutions were ever made over the saga.

They’re wonderful people who have welcomed me with open arms. But they are also extremely clingy and lack common boundaries. We recently moved to a larger home that’s closer to them but farther from my family. Now that we live closer, they constantly pop in unannounced for visits at inconvenient times, such as while I’m getting dinner plated up. His mother has been told numerous times that we are private people and don’t like a lot of company, but she still keeps doing the same thing. She’s also trying to throw parties at our house and talking about putting in a pool, even though we have told her no repeatedly. And, Abby, when one family member shows up, you can almost guarantee that two or three more will show up soon after. When we moved in, my family came to see the house. They had been here no more than five minutes when his entire family -- aunts, cousins, everyone -- showed up and took over!

    "text": "FAYETTEVLLE -- University of Arkansas volleyball Coach Jason Watson said his team was playing better recently, but the Razorbacks weren't able to sustain that in a 3-1 loss (25-16, 25-22, 16-25, 25-14) to Alabama on Wednesday night at Barnhill Arena. Arkansas (5-18, 1-11 SEC) dropped its 11th consecutive match. \"I did (feel like they were playing better) coming out of Oklahoma,\" Watson said. \"Tonight. I'm not sure where we were at. The inability to stay on task for long periods of time ... we give up big runs of points and just some strange things. It's been a long season and I get that, but you've still got a job to do and that job is to go play volleyball.\" Alabama bounced back after dropping the third set, breaking from an 8-8 tie. The Crimson Tide put together an 8-1 run to take control. Jada Lawson's kill pulled Arkansas within 16-11, but the Razorbacks got no closer as Alabama pulled away to close out the match. Alabama Coach Rashinda Reed said her team has had plenty of experience of trying to come back when the opposition takes a set. \"We've actually had a lot of practice at these moments,\" Reed said with a laugh. \"These are things we are actually working on with our team. It was all about staying steady and relentless, and they did a really nice job of doing that. I was really proud of them in the mental side and the ability to execute within our system. \"Arkansas is a very good team. They are coached well, good defensive team. Our understanding was we just had to keep going.\" The Crimson Tide (12-11, 4-9) snapped their three-match skid. The Razorbacks haven't won since defeating Ole Miss in five sets on Sept. 26. Victoria Barrett finished with a match-high 17 kills to go with 17 digs for Alabama, while Palmer and Agee added 13 and 11 kills, respectively. Trinity Stanger also added a match-high 19 digs. Parker Duncan led Arkansas with 14 kills to go with 10 digs and hit .375. Lawson added nine kills, while setter Kiki Remensperger added 18 assists and 16 digs.

    "title": "The FIFO CEO: Rail Loop boss commutes from Queensland",
    "text": "Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. The $900,000-a-year executive responsible for Melbourne’s most expensive infrastructure project commutes from Brisbane and is paid additional expenses to attend unscheduled meetings. Freedom of information documents released to The Age reveal the extraordinary arrangements to enable Suburban Rail Loop Authority chief executive Frankie Carroll to maintain a residence in Brisbane, fly in and out of his Big Build job, and bill taxpayers for flight costs when he is “recalled to duty”. Suburban Rail Loop Authority chief executive Frankie Carroll. This is an employment term used when staff are asked to work or return to the office outside their regular work hours. Carroll, who is on a remuneration package of between $900,000 and $909,999, has led the Allan government’s signature infrastructure project since 2021. This includes superannuation and accrued leave and other entitlements. While Carroll meets the cost of his regular commute himself, the documents show that taxpayers were charged when Carroll flew to Melbourne, where the rail loop authority is headquartered, to attend a conference. In another example of travel costs billed to taxpayers, a flight from Brisbane to Melbourne is attributed to a “meeting in Canberra” but no further detail is provided. The released documents show that since Carroll was headhunted to run the SRLA, he has taken more than 30 domestic flights funded by taxpayers. The flights suggest he divides his time evenly between Victoria and Queensland and sometimes flies directly to Sydney or Canberra from Brisbane for meetings and conferences. The value of the flights attributed to Carroll being “recalled to duty” is $3645 since 2021.

Source: US Department of Justice in a press release, as reported by European Pravda Details: According to the indictment, in May 2022, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Leonova – using accomplices based in the US – purchased and unlawfully exported numerous avionics and other aircraft equipment from the United States to Russia. The press release said the exported goods were intended for use on private aircraft operated by Leonova's former employer, a company listed among the entities restricted by the US Department of Commerce. Investigators established that Leonova and her associates had purchased aviation components from US-based distributors. Using companies registered in Armenia, the Maldives and other countries, they subsequently transferred the components to Russia without the required export licences from the US Department of Commerce. \"This defendant tried to circumvent US law to enrich herself by procuring and illicitly exporting, from the United States to Russia, avionics and other prohibited equipment,\" said US Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro.

    "title": "Flick hails Yamal’s spark in Brugge draw but warns over injury",
    "text": "Barcelona manager Hansi Flick expressed delight at seeing Lamine Yamal rediscover his spark but urged caution over the teenager’s ongoing groin issue after his dazzling display in Wednesday’s 3-3 Champions League draw with Club Brugge. After battling a persistent groin injury in recent weeks, the 18-year-old built on Sunday’s La Liga outing – when he netted his first league goal since August – with another vibrant performance in Belgium, helping Barça claw back three times to secure a point. Nicolo Tresoldi and Ferran Torres exchanged early goals before Carlos Forbs put Brugge back ahead just before halftime. Yamal struck back a minute past the hour mark, slotting home coolly after slicing through the defense with a brilliant solo run. “I’m happy that Lamine is back at this level, but we don’t know what will happen tomorrow or next Sunday,” the German coach said. “The important thing is that he manages his situation because it’s not easy. He has to be really focused on how he trains and also on the treatments. Hopefully the pain goes away.” Receiving a pass outside the penalty area, Yamal surged through two defenders, laid the ball off to Fermín López, and continued his run, collecting López’s deft backheel pass before slotting in from close range. “I try to do the best I can,” Yamal said. “The move went really quick, and Fermín left me the ball with a nice flick, and I finished it.” However, Brugge winger Forbs put the hosts ahead again in the 63rd minute, and later Yamal’s other effort deflected in off Christos Tzolis to seal a 3-3 draw through an own goal. Yamal added that speculation surrounding his groin injury – and suggestions it had affected his state of mind – had been overblown and fueled by false reports. “A lot has been said about my pubalgia, that I was sad, but it was all lies,” he said. “I’ve been the same as always – very happy, focused on my work, trying to get back to training and play at this level, which is where I feel best and enjoy myself the most.” Yamal’s goal drew comparisons with Barcelona great Lionel Messi, but the Spain international said he was not getting carried away by the praise. “Messi has scored thousands of goals like that,” he said. “I have to make my own way and hope to score many more goals like that.”",

    "text": "Dear Eric: Over the last 10 years, the father of my grandchildren has been a severe alcoholic. Two years ago, my daughter left him. After he had been living on the streets, my daughter asked if he could stay in my basement so that he would get sufficient rest and be able to have the children with him; she knows it’s important for the children to be with their dad. I agreed. This young man has been unemployed for at least two years. He has been going to AA, and although he has relapsed several times, he has not been violently drunk the way he was in the past. He seems to be working the program. I lent him $300 in July to pay part of an open court case he has. At that time, I wrote out that he had to have a job and pay me back the $300 by a certain date, or he would no longer be living at my house. He has interviewed for many jobs but is still unemployed. I don’t know if he self-sabotages or doesn’t follow through. What I do know is that housing him is expensive for me – feeding a 28-year-old male, and the added electricity and other utilities that, of course, he uses. The due date for the $300 is looming. Part of me thinks that his children need to be able to see him still, and maybe I should let him stay; the other part of me says that he needs to move out. He’s been given ample opportunity to make good on what he owes me and to be employed. What do you think? – Full House Dear House: The car may already be out of the driveway on this one, but it’s probably helpful to separate the loan from the housing agreement. He needs to pay you back either way. And he needs to move out. Right now, you’re overextended. You’re housing your daughter’s ex, you’re feeding him, and you’re loaning him money. It’s too much for you and it’s too much for the fraught relationship you have. I’m curious what he’s contributing to the house in return for a place to live. Even without a job, he’s capable of helping around the house, of cooking, of cleaning, of showing up for you. While it may be good for the children to have their father in their lives, you should ask whether living under your roof is the only way for him to accomplish that. Perhaps the best place for him right now is a recovery house, where he can continue to get support in working his program, as well as support and accountability in his job pursuits. Talk to him about housing first. It shouldn’t be a punishment for not repaying the loan. Instead, frame it as a conversation about the best path forward for everyone. Send questions to R.

    "text": "They were the four mismatched roommates who redefined retirement life in Miami, but in reality, the stars of The Golden Girls were making serious bank. During the 1985 debut season of the series, Betty White, Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty were reportedly paid $US30,000 ($A46,000) for each episode.

    "title": "All Set for Anambra Election as Soludo, 15 Candidates Battle for Governorship",
    "text": "All is set for the Anambra governorship election billed for Saturday, November 8, where 16 governorship candidates from various political parties including the incumbent governor of the state, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo would be doing battle. Among the political parties contesting the election are; Prof. Chukwuma Soludo of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu of All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Paul Chukwuma of Young Progressives Party (YPP), Mr John Nwosu of African Democratic Congress (ADC), and Dr George Moghalu of Labour Party (LP). Others are Oti Echezona of Allied People’s Movement (APM), Ms. Chioma Ifemeludike of AAC,  Jeff Nweke of Action Alliance (AA), Charles Onyeze of Accord, Geoff Onyejegbu of New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Jude Ezenwafor of People’s Democratic Party (PDP), and Chukwududem Nweke of Action Peoples Party  (APP). Some more include; Jerry Okeke of Boot Party, Ndidi Olieh of National Rescue Movement (NRM), Martin Ugwoji of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) and Vincent Chukwurah of Social Democratic Party (SDP). Out of the 16, only few are properly rooted in the state, with candidates who posses the capability to win the election. Six of the most popular among them include: Prof Chukwuma Soludo, Nicholas Ukachukwu, Dr George Moghalu, Mr John Nwosu, Sir Paul Chukwuma and Chief Jeff Nweke. Of the six however, the zoning arrangement in the state which has remained an unwritten pact, but very much effective seems to make it near impossible for two of the candidates earlier mentioned. They are; Paul Chukwuma  and Chief Jeff Nweke who hail from the Northern and Central senatorial zone respectively. There have been argument if others who are favoured by the zoning arrangement which favours candidates from Anambra South zone can truly unsit Soludo, who despite being from same favoured zone is also from a dominant political party (APGA) in the state, and yet holds the power of incumbency. Soludo is believed by many to have performed well in his first tenure, and is also very well liked among the people, while some other believe his administration has been trailed with poor performance and riddled with insecurity. Meanwhile, a total of 2,802,790 registered voters would participate in the election. Some members of the public who spoke to THISDAY insist that they are ready with their voters card to elect a candidate of their choice. Members of the media and other election observers have also been accredited for election coverage, with a strict instructions that only accredited observers would be allowed to move around, while the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies have expressed readiness for the exercise. Speaking during a stakeholders meeting held with political parties and their candidates on Wednesday, the INEC chairman, Prof Joash Amupitan said officials of the commission are ready to give Anambra the best. He revealed that some individuals were determined to cause confusion and undermine the credibility of the polls through vote buying, but assured stakeholders that despite such distractions, the commission remained fully committed to conducting a free, fair, and credible election in the state. “INEC is fully prepared for this election. We will not tolerate any acts capable of compromising the integrity of the electoral process,” he vowed. Also, the head of security during election duty, CP Abayomi Shogunle who has already resumed duties told journalists through a press release signed by the spokesperson for Anambra State Police Command, SP Tochukwu Ikenga he is set for the job. Ikenga said: “Upon assumption of duty, CP Shogunle activated the IGP’s Enforcement Protocol for anti-electoral offences to ensure zero tolerance for ballot snatching, vote-buying, political thuggery, and voter intimidation. The CP has also emplace a central command framework to ensure real-time intelligence sharing, coordination, and rapid response with a joint deployment of over 60,000 security personnel of agencies within the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) who will secure the 5,720 polling units with tactical reserves along inter-LGA and State boundaries, and also designated election collation centers.” Ikenga quoted Shogunle as reiterating a total ban on all vigilante groups and all other quasi-security groups in the state as only the federal government security agencies are authorized to provide election security duties as provided by the laws of the federation. He said VIP movements with armed escorts or security aides at polling or collation centres are strictly prohibited, as violators will face immediate apprehension, withdrawal of such escorts, and prosecution. “Only designated INEC officials, accredited observers, and journalists are allowed to move freely between designated areas,” Shogunle said. A public affairs analyst, Mr Ikechukwu Eze told THISDAY that Anambra would be expecting very free, fair and credible election from from INEC. He said: “I don’t see any impediment in the way of INEC from giving us the best election ever. The candidates have signed peace accord, and even the governor of the state affirmed that the candidates are ready to play by the rules and eschew violence. I do not see anything in their way from conducting an acceptable election now,” he said. The State government also announced a public holiday for all public and civil servants. An announcement  by the head of service, Bare Theodora Igwegbe stated that the public holiday is to allow workers move to places they are registered to vote as there would be no movement on election day.

    "text": "DALLAS — Boeing will not face a criminal conspiracy charge over two 737 Max jetliner crashes that killed 346 people, after a federal judge in Texas on Thursday granted the government’s request to dismiss the case. As part of a deal to drop the charge, the American aerospace company agreed to pay or invest an additional US$1.1 billion in fines, compensation for the crash victims’ families, and internal safety and quality measures. The agreement lets Boeing choose its own compliance consultant instead of getting an independent monitor. Prosecutors said Boeing deceived government regulators about a flight-control system that was later implicated in the fatal flights. The ruling comes after an emotional hearing in September in Fort Worth where relatives of some of the victims urged U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor to reject the deal and instead appoint a special prosecutor. O’Connor wrote Thursday that the deal “fails to secure the necessary accountability to ensure the safety of the flying public.” Still, he said, the court can’t block the dismissal simply because it disagrees with the government’s view that the deal serves the public interest. The Justice Department has said a jury trial risks sparing Boeing from further punishment. The judge also said the government hadn’t acted in bad faith, had explained their decision and had met their obligations under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act. All passengers and crew died when two 737 Max jetliners went down less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019 -- a Lion Air flight that plunged into the sea off the coast of Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed into a field after taking off from Addis Ababa. Some of the victims’ families plan to appeal O’Connor’s decision. “When a company’s failures cost so many lives, ending a criminal case behind closed doors erodes trust and weakens deterrence for every passenger who steps onto a plane,” Paul Njoroge, a Canadian man who lost his wife and three small children in the Ethiopia crash, said in a statement released by the families through their lawyers. The long-running case has taken many twists and turns since the Justice Department first charged Boeing in January 2021 with defrauding the government. A proposed deal that would have required Boeing to plead guilty collapsed after O’Connor did not approve it. In a statement after Thursday’s ruling, Boeing said it would honor the agreement and continue “the significant efforts we have made as a company to strengthen our safety, quality, and compliance programs.” The Justice Department said in a statement that they are “confident that this resolution is the most just outcome.” The department has said the families of 110 crash victims either support resolving the case before it reaches trial or did not oppose the deal. Meanwhile, nearly 100 families have opposed the agreement. More than a dozen relatives spoke at the Sept. 3 hearing in Texas, with some coming from Europe and Africa. “Do not allow Boeing to buy its freedom,” said Catherine Berthet, who traveled from France. Her daughter, Camille Geoffroy, died in the Ethiopia crash. The first civil trial over that crash opened Wednesday in federal court in Chicago. The jury must decide how much Boeing has to pay the family of one victim, Shikha Garg, a United Nations consultant who was among several passengers traveling to a UN environmental assembly in Kenya. The criminal case centered around a software system that Boeing developed for the 737 Max, which airlines began flying in 2017. The plane was Boeing’s answer to a new, more fuel-efficient model from European rival Airbus, and Boeing billed it as an updated 737 that wouldn’t require much additional pilot training. But the Max did include significant changes, some of which Boeing downplayed -- most notably, the addition of an automated flight-control system designed to help account for the plane’s larger engines. Boeing didn’t mention the system in airplane manuals, and most pilots didn’t know about it. In both of the deadly crashes, that software pitched the nose of the plane down repeatedly based on faulty readings from a single sensor, and pilots flying for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines were unable to regain control. After the Ethiopia crash, the planes were grounded worldwide for 20 months. Investigators found that Boeing did not inform key Federal Aviation Administration personnel about changes it had made to the software before regulators set pilot training requirements for the Max and certified the airliner for flight.

    "title": "iQIYI Concludes First Virtual Production Open Day, Showcasing How AI and Technology are Transforming Filmmaking",
    "text": "BEIJING, Nov. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- iQIYI, China's leading online entertainment platform, successfully hosted its inaugural Virtual Production Open Day on November 2 in Hengdian, Zhejiang Province, attracting nearly 200 seasoned film and television professionals.

    "title": "Prince Harry's visa row back in spotlight as Andrew asked to testify in US",
    "text": "Prince Harry’s visa row has been brought back into the spotlight as a result of the latest news that Andrew Mountbatten Windsor has been asked to appear before the US Congress for questioning over his links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

You can check out at any time. Read our Privacy Policy While he does not do so anymore, a previous history of drug-taking can be grounds for the US Government to reject a US visa application, with The Heritage Foundation wanting to know whether Harry told the truth on his visa and if he received special treatment as a result of his royal roots in the visa process. This is a matter that The Heritage Foundation have taken to court before, with the Trump administration unearthing new documents this year which show Harry has a so-called \"golden ticket\" visa in the form of a special A-1 'Head of State' document. This is a visa given to members of foreign royal families. Other details about his right to live in the US have not been made public, however it is believed Harry, 41, has not lied on any visa documents. Speaking on The Late Show Live about Andrew being asked testify before US Congress over his links to Epstein, The Heritage Foundation's Nile Gardiner has argued that Harry should also testify over his visa. As reported by GB News, Gardiner said: \"I do think actually, there's a far stronger case for Prince Harry to be called to testify before Congress about his illegal drug use. \"We are appealing to the Trump administration to release Prince Harry's immigration records because he admitted to extensive illegal drug use in his own book, Spare, and Prince Harry was granted entry to the United States. \"Normally, of course, if you've used illegal drugs, that's a criminal offence and it's very difficult to enter into the United States. Was he given preferential treatment or did he lie on his application form? That is a federal criminal offence that would result in deportation or five years in jail.\" Harry has not been formally called to testify over the matter. He has lived in America since quitting royal life in 2020 with his wife Meghan Markle and their two children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.

    "title": "Bears basking in glory of historic title run",
    "text": "A school parade on Thursday afternoon starting at Moscow High School and stretching a mile to the Bear Den parking lot was only the latest in a series of tributes that have poured in for the Moscow girls soccer team in the days after its first state title in program history. In the Class 5A Inland Empire League’s postseason honors released last week, Moscow’s Jessica Brown was named coach of the year, Bear co-goalkeeper Bailie Brown was tabbed as newcomer of the year and teammates Kolbi Kiblen, Addison Lassen, Mattea Nuhn and Hazel Stevens each made the all-league team. Meanwhile, co-goalie Kyanna Winther won the Tribune’s most recent P1FCU Prep Athlete of the Week award. “Super proud of my team, and that we were able to make history,” Winther said. “It’s exciting. We definitely knew it was going to happen; we just had to get our chance at State.” The journey to State Moscow assistant coach Seth Vieux described this year’s team as a “defensive monster.” The Bears delivered 12 shutouts in 20 matches, allowing their opponents a cumulative total of 12 goals. Winther and Brown shared goalkeeping duties more or less evenly throughout the season in what Vieux called an “interesting and extremely rare” arrangement. “Goalkeeping is usually, ‘You pick one and you stick with them the whole year,’” he said. “They both just performed so well, we stuck with it.” Moscow went 7-0-2 in league play to clinch a regular-season IEL title and enter the postseason with momentum, but encountered a painful setback when it dropped a tiebreaking shootout in an Oct. 15 district tournament final against perennial nemesis Sandpoint, which has now topped Moscow at Districts the last four consecutive years. The Bears would bounce back three days later with a 3-0 shutout of Wood River in a state play-in match. “I remember our captain Kolbi Kiblen saying (after the Sandpoint loss), ‘Remember this feeling,’” Moscow’s Winnie Colvin said. “’We don’t want to feel it again; we’ve got to win next the game.’ When we got that second chance and won it, we all had full faith that we could still win State, and kept going.” Making history In their Idaho Class 5A state tournament run at Middleton High School on Oct. 23-25, the lone goal the Bears conceded came in the semifinals against top-seeded Hillcrest of Ammon, a previously unbeaten team which had scored 88 goals in its own 19-match season prior to that encounter. As time expired with the foes locked in a 1-1 dead heat, that match provided Moscow with a chance for redemption in the penalty kick tiebreak scenario — one for which the Bears had made a point of preparing themselves. “We hadn’t really worked on (PKs) before (the district final), so definitely after we had lost that game, we trained for it in practice and found our shooters,” Winther said. “Everyone was much more confident after we practiced it once or twice.” A highlight save from Winther would knock that tiebreak off the proverbial knife’s edge, giving Moscow a decisive 4-3 advantage. “After saving that one, I definitely got super excited,” Winther said. “Didn’t even know we won at first, but I looked up and saw my whole team running to me and I knew we won. That was pretty exciting.” Having overcome Hillcrest, Moscow found itself in another marathon battle the next day in the title match against Vallivue of Caldwell, which went scoreless into double-overtime before Colvin found the first and only goal, averting another potential shootout. Vieux said it was “truly a team goal,” starting with a turnover forced by the defense and transitioning to what he called an “up-back-through” play, with Edie Sumner, Rebekah Abbott and Stevens representing the three respective components. Stevens would send the ball through to Colvin, who was surging toward the Vallivue box. Then, Colvin finished it off with the goal. “She played me a really nice, well-placed and well-timed ball that I was able to advance onto,” Colvin said. “I took another touch and put it in the top right corner. I just knew I had to get it just over the goalie. Then I got rushed by my teammates and celebrated.” Vieux also praised Colvin’s poise in the biggest moment of her career so far. “This is three years of player growth, to believe in herself to finish goals and not worry (or) pull the ball back to look for somebody else,” Vieux said. “She did what everybody believed she could do.” Dawn of an era? Will this state glory remain unique in Bear soccer history, or does it herald more to come? The Bears graduate a large class of seven seniors, including starters Kiblen, Lassen, Brooklyn Becker and Kaylee Wood, and will need to rebuild the defensive back row that has been key to their success. They are, however, set to enjoy a strong and experienced rising class with the likes of Colvin, Abbott, Winther and Sumner taking up the mantle of senior leadership. “With the roster we’re going to have next year, I think we’re able to do well again, and we’ll just have to fill those spots of our missing seniors,” Vieux said. Likewise, having run the state gauntlet, Vieux is optimistic that the Bears will be well positioned to finally turn the tables on Sandpoint at the district level. “Hopefully this state title helps a lot of our players get over that mental block,” he said. Regardless, the Bears are happy for now to reap the rewards of a run that felt like a fitting display of the effort, resilience, camaraderie and unity they prided themselves on all along. “It just kind of showed that’s what Moscow soccer is,” Colvin said. “We all worked as one, and we were confident and trusted each other, and that’s how we won it.”",

During the visit from November 7-8, PM Shehbaz will take part in the celebrations marking the fifth anniversary of the country’s Victory Day, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office. The premier, during the meeting, reiterated that the victory of Azerbaijan against Armenia is a beacon of hope for oppressed people striving for self-determination — including the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, and Palestine. The prime minister felicitated the government and people of Azerbaijan on the Victory Day, which is observed to commemorate the historic victory in the 44-day-long Karabakh Liberation War against Armenia. He also appreciated President Aliyev for signing the historic peace agreement with Armenia earlier this year. The two leaders reviewed the whole range of bilateral relationships and agreed to further strengthen their multi-layered cooperation in the fields of politics, trade and investment, energy, connectivity, and defence. PM Shehbaz extended an invitation to President Aliyev to visit Pakistan at his earliest convenience, which he graciously accepted. This marks PM Shehbaz’s third visit to Azerbaijan in 2025, following his official trip in February and his participation as head of Pakistan’s delegation at the 17th Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) Summit in Khankendi, which took place from July 3 to 4. PM Shehbaz had also met President Aliyev on the sidelines of the ECO Summit and reaffirmed that the interactions between the leadership of both countries had helped in making the relationship ever stronger.",

    "text": "Dear Eric: My younger brother, who is 70, has always been known to embellish stories and has a bigger-than-life heart. More recently his stories are pure fantasy tales. His house has become borderline hoarder for several years. His stories contradict what he tells me – “I’m clearing out clutter “ only to hear he’s going to hire some company to clean the clutter. He has a difficult time staying focused on the task at hand. He’s had a “business plan” for his “business” that, while feasible, hasn’t brought him any income for 10 years. As the older brother, any comments I’ve made are faced with extreme defensive statements, so I refrain and continue to listen to story after story with no focus – buying/not buying new car, seeking house/not selling house to move to West Coast, next vacation trip, how much he wants to visit us, et cetera, et cetera. When do I wave the white flag? – White Flag for White Lies Dear White Flag: Is your brother looking for advice or looking for an audience? As the older brother, you may have fallen into a pattern of giving his plans critique and approval. That may not be what he’s seeking right now, hence the defensiveness. And hence your fatigue. If you’ve spent decades telling him the right way to do things and he has spent decades doing things his own way, it’s no wonder you feel you’re at an impasse. One way to wave the white flag while still maintaining your relationship is by practicing distance from his stories. When he’s telling you something, try to remember that this is his journey and it doesn’t affect you. You might even want to visualize yourself letting it fall from your hands. And what do you say in response? “Oh, OK.” Simple, noncommittal. You also don’t have to subject yourself to every flight of fancy. You may not be the right audience for him and you’re not under an obligation to be. Letting go can also look like you saying, “I’m glad you’ve got a plan but I’m not in a place to chat about it right now. Can we talk about something else?” Send questions to R.

    "title": "Opinion: From service to civic engagement: Honoring Iowa veterans today and every day",
    "text": "This November, we proudly observe Military Family Appreciation Month and Veterans Day, two opportunities to honor the courage and sacrifice of Iowa’s brave military members and their families. Veterans Day recognizes the dedication and sacrifice of our nation’s brave men and women who put it all on the line to maintain our freedom and peace. What began as Armistice Day, more than a century ago, paying tribute to those who fought in World War I, has endured and evolved into a day that pays homage to current military members and veterans of all wars. The first Armistice Day was proclaimed on Nov. 11, 1919 by then-President Woodrow Wilson. “To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country’s service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the council of nations..”. It was recognized with parades, public recognitions, and suspension of business. I am honored to have descended from several brave individuals who gave their all to defend this nation. From fighting in the Ohio Infantry during the Civil War, serving in Cuba during the Spanish American War, and defending democracy and freedom in the Army during World War II, I could not be prouder to claim them as family. And many of my fellow Iowans have descended from the strong men and women who have stepped up to serve our great nation. Iowa has a history of stepping up. At least 41 veterans of the Revolution are buried in Iowa. More than 1,000 Iowans bore arms in the Mexican War, 76,000 in the Civil War, and 5,600 in the Spanish-American War. In World War I and World War II, over 375,000 served. We saw 85,000 serve in the Korean War, 115,000 in the Vietnam War, 3,000 in the Persian Gulf War. And more recently, more than 3,000 brave Iowa men and women served in Operation Desert Storm and around 20,000 Iowans bore arms in the War on Terrorism. Currently, Iowa has nearly 2,000 Iowa National Guard and 1,800 Iowa Reserves members deployed, actively serving our nation. Our thoughts are with these brave individuals and their families as they work to protect our freedom. As we pause on this day, contemplating the history of our nation and giving thanks to all the brave soldiers who have served our country, I encourage you to reach out to a veteran or military member in your life and thank them for their service. A simple gesture, a phone call, a message, or a heartfelt conversation can mean the world to someone who has sacrificed so much. I also invite you to visit the ‘Honor a Veteran’ page on sos.iowa.gov, where you can leave a tribute to a veteran who has made a difference in your life. Since its inception in 2012, this initiative has collected over 9,500 tributes. As part of this initiative, we encourage eligible Iowa voters to not only honor a veteran, but to honor them with your vote. Participating in our elections process and exercising your fundamental right to vote is a beautiful way to honor those who have fought for our nation and protected these fundamental rights. Thank you again to the brave men and women. We can never thank you enough for your sacrifice.",

    "title": "Disagreement Between Two Kidney Function Tests Predicts Serious Health Problems",
    "text": "NEW YORK and HOUSTON, Nov. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A mismatch between two common tests for kidney function may indicate a higher risk for kidney failure, heart disease, and death, a new study shows. Health care providers for decades have measured blood levels of the molecule creatinine to track the rate at which kidneys filter waste from muscle breakdown in the bloodstream. According to more recent guidelines, levels of cystatin C, a small protein made by all cells in the body, can also be used to measure kidney function. Since these two tests are influenced by different factors — including some related to disease or aging — using both markers together can provide a better measure of kidney function and risk of organ failure than either one alone. Health care providers for decades have measured blood levels of the molecule creatinine to track the rate at which kidneys filter waste from muscle breakdown in the bloodstream. According to more recent guidelines, levels of cystatin C, a small protein made by all cells in the body, can also be used to measure kidney function. Since these two tests are influenced by different factors — including some related to disease or aging — using both markers together can provide a better measure of kidney function and risk of organ failure than either one alone. Led by NYU Langone Health researchers, the new work reveals that many people, especially those who are sick, often have a large gap between the two readings, which may be a signal of future disease. Specifically, the global study shows that more than a third of hospitalized participants had a cystatin C-based readout of kidney function that was at least 30% lower than one based on their creatinine levels. \"Our findings highlight the importance of measuring both creatinine and cystatin C to gain a true understanding of how well the kidneys are working, particularly among older and sicker adults,\" said study co-corresponding author Morgan Grams, MD, PhD. \"Evaluating both biomarkers may identify far more people with poor kidney function, and earlier in the disease process, by covering the blind spots that go with either test.\"The study is publishing online Nov. 7 in the Journal of the American Medical Association and is simultaneously being presented at the American Society of Nephrology's annual Kidney Week conference.Beyond detecting signs of disease, assessing patients' kidney function is important for calculating the appropriate dosage for cancer medicines, antibiotics, and many other drugs, says Grams, the Susan and Morris Mark Professor of Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.During another investigation, the results of which were published the same day, the same research team found that a record number of people worldwide have chronic kidney disease, which is now the ninth leading cause of death globally. Having new ways to spot the condition early can help ensure that patients receive swift treatment and avoid more dramatic interventions such as dialysis and organ transplantation, says Grams, who is also a professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.For the recent investigation, the research team analyzed health care records, blood tests, and demographic data collected from 860,966 men and women of a half-dozen nationalities. All participants had their creatinine and cystatin C levels measured on the same day and received follow-ups 11 years later on average. The team considered factors unrelated to kidney function that influence the biomarkers' readings, such as smoking, obesity, and history of cancer.Performed as part of the international Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium, the study is the largest to date to explore differences between the two tests and whether they may signal potential health problems, the authors say. Established to better understand and treat the condition, the consortium provides evidence for global definitions of chronic kidney disease and related health risks.According to the new findings, those whose cystatin C-based measures of kidney filtration were at least 30% lower than their creatinine-based measures were at higher risk for death, heart disease, and heart failure than those who had a smaller difference between the two metrics. The former group was also more likely to be diagnosed with severe chronic kidney disease that required dialysis or an organ transplant. The same was found for 11% of outpatients and seemingly healthy volunteers.Grams notes that while cystatin C testing was first recommended in 2012 by the international organization Kidney Disease — Improving Global Outcomes, a 2019 survey revealed that less than 10% of clinical laboratories in the United States performed it in-house. The two largest laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp, now offer the test.\"These results underscore the need for physicians to take advantage of the fact that more hospitals and health care providers are starting to offer cystatin C testing,\" said study co-corresponding author Josef Coresh, MD, PhD, director of NYU Langone's Optimal Aging Institute. \"Physicians might otherwise miss out on valuable information about their patients' well-being and future medical concerns.\"Coresh, who is also the Terry and Mel Karmazin Professor of Population Health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, cautions that among the hospitalized Americans in the study, less than 1% were tested for cystatin C.Funding for the study was provided by National Institutes of Health grant R01DK100446 and by the National Kidney Foundation.Michelle Estrella, MD, MHS, at the University of California, San Francisco, is the study's first author.

During another investigation, the results of which were published the same day, the same research team found that a record number of people worldwide have chronic kidney disease, which is now the ninth leading cause of death globally. Having new ways to spot the condition early can help ensure that patients receive swift treatment and avoid more dramatic interventions such as dialysis and organ transplantation, says Grams, who is also a professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. For the recent investigation, the research team analyzed health care records, blood tests, and demographic data collected from 860,966 men and women of a half-dozen nationalities. All participants had their creatinine and cystatin C levels measured on the same day and received follow-ups 11 years later on average. The team considered factors unrelated to kidney function that influence the biomarkers' readings, such as smoking, obesity, and history of cancer. Performed as part of the international Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium, the study is the largest to date to explore differences between the two tests and whether they may signal potential health problems, the authors say. Established to better understand and treat the condition, the consortium provides evidence for global definitions of chronic kidney disease and related health risks. According to the new findings, those whose cystatin C-based measures of kidney filtration were at least 30% lower than their creatinine-based measures were at higher risk for death, heart disease, and heart failure than those who had a smaller difference between the two metrics. The former group was also more likely to be diagnosed with severe chronic kidney disease that required dialysis or an organ transplant. The same was found for 11% of outpatients and seemingly healthy volunteers. Grams notes that while cystatin C testing was first recommended in 2012 by the international organization Kidney Disease — Improving Global Outcomes, a 2019 survey revealed that less than 10% of clinical laboratories in the United States performed it in-house. The two largest laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp, now offer the test. \"These results underscore the need for physicians to take advantage of the fact that more hospitals and health care providers are starting to offer cystatin C testing,\" said study co-corresponding author Josef Coresh, MD, PhD, director of NYU Langone's Optimal Aging Institute. \"Physicians might otherwise miss out on valuable information about their patients' well-being and future medical concerns.\" Coresh, who is also the Terry and Mel Karmazin Professor of Population Health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, cautions that among the hospitalized Americans in the study, less than 1% were tested for cystatin C. Funding for the study was provided by National Institutes of Health grant R01DK100446 and by the National Kidney Foundation. Michelle Estrella, MD, MHS, at the University of California, San Francisco, is the study's first author. Kai-Uwe Eckardt, MD, at Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin in Germany, is the study last author.

    "title": "Mario Kart Hot Wheels Tracks Get Massive Early Black Friday Discounts",
    "text": "Save big on the Amazon-exclusive Mario Kart Circuit Track Set and the recently released Bowser's Castle Raceway. By \n    Steven Petite\n   on November 7, 2025 at 12:07PM PST Hot Wheels Mario Kart: Bowser's Castle Raceway $56 (was $86.39) Hot Wheels: Mario Kart Circuit Track Set $68 (was $98) | Amazon Exclusive The two coolest Hot Wheels Mario Kart tracks sold on Amazon are discounted to superb prices this weekend. The Amazon-exclusive Mario Kart Circuit Track Set is down to $68 (was $98). Over 10% of units are claimed at the time of writing, so snag the Circuit Track while you can. Mario Kart fans should also check out the recently released Bowser's Castle Raceway Track Set. Released in September for $86, Bowser's Castle Raceway is on sale for $56 at Amazon, Walmart, and Target. For Mario Kart Hot Wheels collectors, Bowser's Castle Raceway marks the first appearance of Kamek. You'll also have plenty of storage space for your collection, as the castle doubles as a 35-car garage. Notably, this is the first Mario Kart set to use Hot Wheels' new Speed Snap assembly system. Bowser's Castle Raceway looks significantly cooler than the \"Bowser's Castle\" track set that's exclusive to Target. That one simply has a Bowser figure who tries to stop racers from making the loop. But Bowser's Castle Raceway has a proper castle in the center of the track. Kamek or other Mario Kart racers you already own zip across the treacherous track via a slam launcher. Bowser's minions will try to stop you in a variety of ways, which is awkward since Kamek is Bowser's right-hand Koopa, but perhaps Bullet Bill, Dry Bones, Lakitu, and the castle itself are jealous of that. The track has one tall loop that sends your racer through the castle door. This 34-inch track is one of the larger Mario Kart Hot Wheel sets actively being produced today. As mentioned, Bowser's Castle Raceway implements the new Speed Snap connection system, which makes track pieces easier for kids to assemble. And as the name suggests, the system makes the assembly and teardown processes quicker in general. The Amazon-exclusive Mario Kart Circuit Track Set comes with two diecast racers with their standard karts: Mario and Yoshi. The Circuit Track has two lanes and motorized boosters. Powered by four D batteries, the Circuit Track is one of the coolest Mario Kart Hot Wheels courses. The boosters provide enough force for the karts to make continuous loops around the track. After placing the karts on the launchpad, pressing the Super Mushroom button sends them through the booster and around the track. You can derail the competition in the other lane by pressing the Green Shell button at the right time. The finish line flags move down as you complete laps. The first racer to cross the finish line six times wins. The Circuit Track Set measures 25 x 43 x 16 inches. Smaller Hot Wheels Mario Kart tracks can be added to the course to introduce new obstacles and pathways. The Circuit Track is compatible with the Thwomp Ruins Playset and Piranha Plant Slide Playset. The Piranha Plant Launcher includes Yoshi with his Mach 8 Kart and is on sale for only $14.69 (was $24) at Amazon. Thwomp Ruins is sold out at Amazon, but you can get it for $18.19 (was $26) at Target. It comes with a Luigi Standard Kart. Several other Hot Wheels Mario Kart Track Sets are on sale ahead of Black Friday 2025, including the smaller Bowser's Castle Track Set for $35 (was $50). Mario Kart Hot Wheels Diecast Cars Check out dozens of kart packs and solo racers. Since track sets only include one or two karts, you may want a few additional racers to go with this set. A fitting choice would be the Amazon-exclusive Mario Kart Diecast Car 4-Pack, as it features Bowser, Mario, Luigi, and Black Yoshi for $26. There are several other sets of four Mario Kart racers at Amazon for around the same price.

    "title": "Offshore oil workers must lose weight or face losing their jobs under new safety measures",
    "text": "North Sea oil workers have been told they must lose weight if they want to keep flying offshore, or face losing their jobs. Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) said that from November next year, the maximum weight for a clothed worker should be 124.7kg, so they can be winched by a rescue helicopter in an emergency. A coastguard helicopter can carry a maximum of 249kg, but also has to account for the weight of the average rescue worker (90.3kg), their kit (5kg) and a stretcher (29kg). The OEUK told The Independent that some 2,277 offshore workers weighed above the 124kg limit last year. The industry body said it had decided on the weight limit after an “extensive” review over the last two-and-a-half years, “thoroughly” considering alternatives to a weight limit. Graham Skinner, the health and safety manager at OEUK, said the organisation will be \"working really hard\" over the next 12 months to ensure affected workers can lose weight. Mr Skinner told the BBC that he could not rule out the possibility that the new safety policy would lead to job losses. \"That would be the absolute worst-case scenario,” he said, explaining that employers will now have a responsibility to try to support their workers to fall within the limit by next year. He said it was important that a clear message be conveyed, serving as an “impetus for everyone to get behind the policy and lose weight in time for November next year”. Those who do not meet the 124kg limit “will not get their medical and that will preclude them from getting on a helicopter”. The decision was made to announce the policy this year so that employers could prepare their staff, offer support and address concerns within the workforce. The policy itself was developed in response to concerns highlighted by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and will come into effect on November 1, 2026. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Skinner said there were a further 2,500 offshore workers who were \"below the weight limit but might need some additional support and weight management\", meaning \"5,000 is the total number of people who might be affected to some lesser or greater extent\" by the policy change. John Boland, the regional officer at the Unite union, told the BBC that “there can be support put in” to stop people from losing their jobs. \"The biggest concerns we have had are from individuals that are naturally larger built and in some cases are extremely fit but are above that actual weight limit.

    "title": "Latest hostage remains returned from Gaza identified as Israeli man",
    "text": "A Red Cross vehicle carrying the body of a person believed to be a deceased hostage (Abdel Kareem Hana/AP) Israel said on Saturday that the remains of a hostage returned from Gaza the previous night belong to an Israeli man who died while fighting Hamas in the militants’ October 7 2023 attack that started the war. The identification marked another step forward for the tenuous, US-brokered ceasefire. The body was identified as that of Lior Rudaeff, according to a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Mr Rudaeff was born in Argentina and moved to Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak, a farming community in southern Israel, as a child. He volunteered for more than 40 years as an ambulance driver and was a member of the community’s emergency response team. The forum said he was killed in the Hamas-led attack and that his body was taken to Gaza. Since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, Palestinian militants have released the remains of 23 hostages, including Mr Rudaeff’s body, with five still remaining in Gaza. As part of the deal, Israel has returned the remains of 15 Palestinians for each Israeli hostage. So far, Israel has handed over the bodies of 285 Palestinians, the Red Cross and Gaza’s Health Ministry say. Health officials in Gaza have struggled to identify the bodies without access to DNA kits and have identified 84 of the bodies. Under the terms of the ceasefire, Israel is supposed to allow substantially more aid into Gaza. However, relief efforts under the pact still fall well short of what is needed in Gaza, according to Farhan Haqq, deputy spokesperson for the United Nations. More than 200,000 metric tons in aid is positioned to move into Gaza, but only 37,000 tons, mostly food, have been admitted, he said. The 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage. Israel’s sweeping military offensive has killed more than 68,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

    "title": "Dear Abby: Snotty sister thinks she’s better than me, says I’m now ‘dead’ to her",
    "text": "DEAR ABBY: My older sister thinks she’s better than me. She makes little snide comments and thinks it’s OK. It has led to a couple of big arguments in the past seven years. The last argument was over some money I was missing. She’s been stealing from anybody and everybody -- from hospitals, doctors’ offices, family members and her boyfriend’s family. When I realized that she had stolen money from me as well, it was the last straw. I confronted her, and her response was I am now “dead to her.” We haven’t spoken in several months. Her boyfriend died last week, and she hasn’t told me. (I found out on social media.) Should I reach out to her about funeral arrangements or contact his family instead? His family never really talked to any of us. They didn’t like her because they thought she was only there for his money. -- OUT OF THE LOOP IN ARIZONA DEAR OUT: Unless you feel the need to attempt to make up with your troubled sister, do not reach out. However, if you want to do something for the boyfriend’s family, send them a nice condolence card expressing your sympathy. DEAR ABBY: My niece-in-law, “Justine,” is a few years younger than my husband and I. We have been best friends for the last 25 years. She’s 55 and divorced, with a grown daughter but no man in her life. She’s extremely lonely and has only us as emotional support. During the last year, she has had to move her 78-year-old mother (with whom she has a tumultuous relationship) in with her. Justine’s daughter has distanced herself from her mother because Justine has erratic moods. Recently, she sent me a four-page letter saying how angry she was with me and my family about things that never happened. She invented transgressions, insulted my grown children and targeted my daughter-in-law. My son is furious. My husband, who loves Justine and feels like an older brother, says he wants to repair our family. I love my husband, but my first allegiance is to my kids, and I’m surprised and hurt that he isn’t furious with her for attacking me with untruths. He says we have to find a way to get past this. (She didn’t include him in her letter.) I’m trying to be prepared for upcoming family gatherings. What can be done to repair this? -- LOOKING FOR A WAY IN THE SOUTH DEAR LOOKING: If Justine is inventing things that never happened in order to justify her anger, the chances are great that she is mentally ill. Until she is willing to recognize that she is driving away the people who care for her the most, things may get worse. Suggest to your husband that if he can convince Justine to get the help she needs, you are prepared to forgive her for the hurt she is causing. Then all of you should cross your fingers and hope that she sees the wisdom. Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

    "title": "Moyes emulates Wenger, Ferguson feat as Everton ease past Fulham",
    "text": "Everton head coach David Moyes joined Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson in an exclusive managerial club as he led the Toffees to a 2-0 Premier League win at home to Fulham. The statistics suggested that the fired-up hosts ought to have gone into half time in the ascendancy, but Marco Silva's men had seemingly done enough to keep their hosts at bay in the first 45 minutes. That was until the fourth minute of injury time, though, as veteran midfielder Idrissa Gueye bundled home a deserved opener for the hosts after a period of penalty-box pinball. Moyes's men also had two strikes disallowed in the first half before having another effort ruled out at the start of the second period, after which the Cottagers belatedly improved with and without the ball. However, the visitors' efforts were not helped by a cruel injury to striker Rodrigo Muniz - who came off just 17 minutes after being sent on as a substitute - and Everton killed the game off via a Michael Keane header in the closing stages. Moyes's triumph on Saturday was his 20th against Fulham in the Premier League, meaning that the Scotsman is just the third manager to win 20+ games against a single side in the competition after Wenger (four teams) and Ferguson (eight clubs). Back to winning ways at the Hill Dickinson Stadium, Everton have now risen to 11th in the Premier League table, four points and four places above Fulham in 15th. Everton are back to doing what they do best - winning football matches at home - while Fulham's abysmal away-day trend is showing no sign of ending anytime soon. Proving that their 3-0 beatdown at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur was an anomaly - at least for now - the Toffees were on it from the get-go and thoroughly deserved to draw first blood before the interval. Silva's men improved after the manager sent on the effervescent Joshua King, but Muniz's unfortunate injury left the visitors without an out-and-out number nine on the pitch, and it showed. Fulham have now suffered a worrying five consecutive defeats away from home - deficiencies that Silva must address if his side are to avoid being sucked into a relegation battle, as the dreaded drop zone is coming closer into view. 45 +4 min: Everton 1-0 Fulham (Idrissa Gueye) Not one of the more conventional goals you will ever see, but a potentially crucial one nonetheless! Vitaliy Mykolenko's cross causes carnage in the penalty box, as James Tarkowski's header crashes the bar, Tim Iroegbunam swipes at the follow-up, and eventually Gueye arrives to awkwardly toe-poke the ball home. 81st min: Everton 2-0 Fulham (Michael Keane) After copious amounts of Fulham pressure, the inevitable has occurred - Everton have doubled their lead and will surely now see this one out! The defensive players are proving their attacking worth for the hosts today, as Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's inswinging corner is on the money for Keane, who mistimes his header but nevertheless shoulders the ball into the roof of the net. Running the show in the first half and providing a sumptuous set-piece for Keane to head home in the second 45, Dewsbury-Hall is a man who is enjoying every minute of his football at present. The former Chelsea man also won a praiseworthy nine of his 13 ground duels, as well as drawing three fouls and registering an 87% pass accuracy during an all-round exemplary display. Possession: Everton 51%-49% Fulham Shots: Everton 14-8 Fulham Shots on target: Everton 5-4 Fulham Corners: Everton 7-3 Fulham Fouls: Everton 11-14 Fulham Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's first half by numbers vs. Fulham: 9/9 duels won 5 tackles 3 fouls won 3x possession won 1 chance created 0 fouls conceded #EVEFUL pic.twitter.com/7nXMrjuI5T Everton's first game back after the international break is a poignant one for Moyes, who returns to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on November 24. As for a struggling Fulham, the Cottagers face a challenging test of their own at home to high-flying Sunderland in two Saturdays' time.",

    "title": "Genesee drops barnburner to Wallace in 1A state quarterfinals",
    "text": "GENESEE — On a night dominated by both teams’ offenses, it was a defensive play that decided the Idaho Class 1A state playoff quarterfinals. And the player who made the play almost didn’t play past halftime. With a chance to win, Wallace junior linebacker Marley Pearce, who had exited the contest earlier in the game with an injury, made the season-extending tackle of Genesee Bulldogs quarterback Jackson Banks on the would-be game-tying 2-point attempt to secure the Miners’ 68-66 overtime win on Friday at Genesee High School. “He wanted to win, so we had to put him back in the second half, and he battled,” Wallace junior Henry Larson said of Pearce. “He’s the heart of the defense right there.” Thanks to a couple of recovered onside kickoff and a nearly unstoppable passing attack, Wallace rattled off 28 points in the fourth quarter, scored the critical 2-point conversion in overtime and stopped the Bulldogs on their 2-point attempt in an absolute classic of a football game. The overtime victory sent Wallace (9-2) to the semifinals of the Idaho 1A state playoffs, where the Miners will face Tri-Valley. For Genesee, its season ended at 8-2. “Hats off to Genesee,” Wallace coach Jared Young said. “Those kids played their butts off. They ran that option really well. Tonight, we’re fortunate to come out with this one. I mean, any playoff win is awesome, whether you win by two points or 60, or whatever — a win’s a win. We love it.” A thrilling finish Wallace led by 14 after the first quarter and by two at halftime. Genesee led by 14 early in the fourth, but the dual two-score deficits were merely fleeting moments in a back-and-forth contest that elapsed over three hours of real time, featured an extra period of football and had 18 total touchdowns and 134 combined points. “How can you not be on cloud nine after an overtime victory in the quarterfinals to go to the semis,” Young said. “I’m sure everybody in the stadium thought they had us in that fourth quarter, but our boys just rallied, came together, and we made some key plays at the end, and that was the difference.” The Miners “pulled a rabbit out of a hat,” as Young put it, to catch Genesee off guard on fourth down early in the fourth quarter. Wallace quarterback Cooper Miller lateraled the ball across the field to Lennox Radford, who sent the ball sailing back to Miller, who churned through the Genesee defense on his way to a 35-yard touchdown. That trick play reanimated the Miners with 8:19 to go. Including that touchdown, Wallace outscored Genesee 36-18 the rest of the way to claim the two-point overtime victory. The Miners recovered two kickoffs — one of which allowed Wallace to double up and erase the Bulldogs’ lead. With 1:47 left in regulation, Wallace tied the game at 52 apiece. The first half ended with three touchdowns in the final 1:13 and the second half ended at a similar breakneck pace, with Banks’ rushing TD giving Genesee the lead back with 31 seconds left, and Wallace’s Miller traversing half the field to find tight end Gus Scott for both the touchdown and the game-tying 2-point conversion to force overtime. Then, the teams traded touchdowns in overtime, but Genesee could not find the two points it needed to extend the game. “I feel bad for Genesee,” Young said. “They deserve this win just as much as we do. They outplayed us for most of the game and we were just fortunate to have a few plays go our way at the end.” Miller, Wallace’s QB, racked up nearly 350 yards passing, with Larson accounting for 183 yards receiving and Radford gaining over 100 yards through the air. A pair of standout juniors Genesee wide receiver Noah Bollman was responsible for more than 150 all-purpose yards and six touchdowns. He also made several standout defensive plays in coverage, batting down key Wallace passes. “He’s a heck of a player. He’s everywhere. He’s our go-to guy,” Genesee coach Jason Hanson said of Bollman. “They pretty much had to throw to the other side because he was shutting everything down on his side. His leadership and his grit also helped propel us forward.” Hanson said that Banks, his QB, showed incredible moxie and leadership to help Genesee get to this point on both the offensive and defensive end. The junior signal-caller threw for 170 yards and ran for more than 60 yards on the ground. He also batted away a 2-point conversion pass that would have won Wallace the game much sooner. “He’s an extra coach,” Hanson said. “We gave him a couple plays, and, you know, he can call his own stuff. It’s really just that whole concept of seeing it out there and living in the moment and he’s really lifting up his guys.” A strong campaign for Genesee It was a heartbreaking finish for Genesee, which last advanced this far into a postseason in 2021. The Bulldogs started the season 7-0 before losing the league title to Deary. The Bulldogs enjoyed a slew of solid contributors, including Cameron Holmes and Carsen Warner-Hall. “It always ends bittersweet even if you win at all; you’re still a bus full of tears just because it ended,” Hanson said. “They just really took everything that they could possibly do to get better every week, and not every team is going to do that. And so we really showed a lot of gumption, as far as all, from the youngest freshman to the seniors, to just improve. “It’s been a long time since Genesee has played this deep into November.” Wallace\t16  16   0   28   8—68 Genesee\t6   24   8   22   6—66 FIRST QUARTER Genesse— Cameron Holmes 3 run (run failed), 8:29 Wallace — Henry Larson 50 pass from Cooper Miller (Miller run), 7:45 Wallace — Lennox Radford 5 pass from Miller (Larson pass from Miller), :06.

    "title": "Parties must pledge in manifestos to eliminate discrimination: Debapriya",
    "text": "Democracy will not sustain if discrimination cannot be eliminated, said noted political and legal analysts and civil society leaders today. \"If we cannot eliminate discrimination, democracy will not be protected in the future because the institutions we create will not be difficult to overcome or break down,\" said SR Osmani, professor of Development Economics at the University of Ulster. Osmani's comment came at a discussion on anti-discriminatory law organised by Citizen's Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh organised the event in collaboration with the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST), Manusher Jonno Foundation, and Nagorik Uddyog (Citizen's Initiative), with support from Switzerland and UNDP, at the Bangladesh-China Conference Centre in the city today. Democracy can go astray due to the tyranny of the majority, but there are two main ways to prevent it: one is by creating institutional obstacles, but there is no guarantee that they will be permanent and effective. In the past, despite constitutional guarantees and recognition, institution after institution has been destroyed, first for party interests, and then for individual interests. \"The answer, therefore, is in the people, who must take responsibility for protecting their power.\" However, the vast majority of these people are victims of discrimination, which starts with socio-economic disparities and ultimately turns into a disparity in political power. When those who are oppressed are asked whether they want democracy or autocracy, they prefer democracy. However, due to discrimination, the attraction towards democracy often decreases over time and they get frustrated and that leads to apathy. \"This then takes them far away from that deliberative democracy or public reason. At that point, they lack the opportunity to enter the discussion forum, and the ruling party, individual or group takes advantage of this lack of opportunity and this apathy.\" The ruling group accumulates more power by exploiting the apathy and consequently accumulating more power. \"In this way, the decline of democracy gradually occurs. This eventually enables the rise of autocracy. Therefore, eradication of discrimination is a must alongside creating institutional obstacles to prevent the decay of democracy,\" Osmani added. The core spirit of the July uprising was anti-discrimination and what emerged out of it are the guarantee of justice, elections and reforms, said Debapriya Bhattacharya, convener of the Citizen's Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh. In order to get justice, citizens must be protected from discrimination. When citizens are empowered, they can express their opinions and actively take part in political and governance process. \"Effective reform is in no way possible without ensuring the rights of the citizens,\" said Bhattacharya, also a distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue. If discrimination continues and deepens, it will not only hinder justice or reform but will also eventually endanger democracy and development. Subsequently, he called on the interim government to issue an ordinance of the anti-discrimination law. The political parties should include in the manifesto that the law is passed in the next parliament, he added. The civil society groups for long have experienced that there were various forms of discrimination in the society in the names of caste, creed, ethnicity and gender and initiated drafting an anti-discrimination law in 2013, said Shaheen Anam, executive director of Manusher Jonno Foundation. Finally, the cabinet had approved a draft law that went to the standing committee in 2022. The draft was not passed for unknown reasons despite promises by the then law minister. The promise of the Liberation War and the July Uprising was to build a humane, non-discriminatory society free from inequality. \"But that has not been possible yet,\" she said. As per the constitution of Bangladesh, all citizens are equal, but the country repeatedly sows divisions based on religion, said Attorney General Md Asaduzzaman. In recent times, another division has entered the scene: political discrimination. \"The entire social system has been driven into such a vicious cycle of criminalisation of politics,\" he said, while calling for coming out of such social, religious and political divisions and discriminations. Asaduzzaman suggested that the civil society make necessary amendments to the draft anti-discrimination law and push the law ministry and law commission on this.",

    "title": "Five changes to income tax as UK households face 'maximum' £624 hit",
    "text": "All the changes Labour Party Chancellor Rachel Reeves could make to income tax in the Autumn Budget have been revealed. There are five ways Ms Reeves could go about shaking up income tax as the Labour Party Autumn Budget is delivered on November 26. Ms Reeves has said she has to “deal with the world as I find it, not the world as I might wish it to be”. And Ms Reeves has spoken of the government’s desire to get those with the “broadest shoulders” to pay more. \"We all need to do our bit,” Ms Reeves said - suggesting everybody could be in the firing line. And Ms Reeves said she would not duck the difficult choices ahead, even if they broke her pledge not to put up income tax, VAT or national insurance. READ MORE Drivers face new monitoring device in cars under UK pay-per-mile tax She said: “I could do what previous governments have done, which is to sweep those challenges under the carpet, to cut capital spending, to make the numbers up. “But then we’d be back here in a year, in five years’ time, with productivity still on its knees, growth underperforming, national debt continuing to rise. So I’m being honest with people.” Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says an income tax rise “would be incredibly difficult politically” and “hit taxpayers hard, adding hundreds of pounds to their tax bill every year”. “If government wanted to change income tax, the most straightforward option would be to add 1p to the basic rate of tax, increasing it from 20% to 21%,” says Laura Suter, the director of personal finance at AJ Bell. “That would cost taxpayers up to £377 a year in extra tax, with anyone earning £50,270 or more facing the maximum hit.” Adding 1p on higher-rate income tax would generate an extra £1.6bn in 2026/7 and a total of £5.8bn over the next three years, according to the same HMRC data. Putting 1p on the additional rate that kicks in at £125,140 raises even less – at £145m in 2026-27 and £640m over three years. “If you earned £35,000 a year, an extra 1p on higher-rate tax wouldn’t cost you anything,” says Coles. “The more you earn, the harder this hits, so if you earned £55,000, it would cost you an extra £47 a year and if you earned £75,000, it would cost you an extra £247.” If an extra 1p was added at every level, someone earning £35,000 a year would see the same change as just a basic rate rise – at £224. If they earned £55,000, it would cost them an extra £424 and if they earn £75,000, it adds up to £624 more. Increasing all rates of income tax by one percentage point would yield almost £11bn a year by 2029–30. A plan to increase income tax rates and lower national insurance rates by two percentage points has also been mooted. Tom Selby, the director of public policy at AJ Bell, says doing it this way means Reeves could still “claim to be protecting the pay packets of ‘working people’”. Tom says: “This would not be the case for retirees. Someone with a taxable retirement income of £35,000 would face a tax hike of almost £450, while a pensioner with an income of £65,000 would be stung with a tax increase of more than £1,000.” “While hitting pensioners in the pocket will clearly be unpopular – particularly in the wake of the winter fuel payment fiasco - it may be viewed as the least bad option.\" “It’s taxation by stealth: the rates stay the same, but a bigger slice of your pay disappears into the taxman’s coffers,” says Ade Babatunde, the senior financial planning director at the wealth manager Rathbones.",

    "title": "Facilitated Telemedicine Boosts Long-Term Recovery for Patients with HCV and OUD, with Andrew Talal, MD",
    "text": "Integrating facilitated telemedicine into opioid treatment programs led to SVR, improved patient satisfaction, and long-term health gains 5 years post-cure. New research reveals the benefits of facilitated medicine for patients impacted by hepatitis C virus (HCV) and in treatment for opioid use disorders (OUD), highlighting the long-term impact of sustained virological response (SVR) and sobriety.1 Andrew Talal, MD, a professor of medicine at the University at Buffalo, presented the findings at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) The Liver Meeting 2025. The data reports sustained improvements in patient health, recovery, and satisfaction 5 years after HCV cure when treated via facilitated telemedicine integrated into opioid treatment programs (OTPs). “Building trust between the patient and the facilitator case manager, it was that trust that then enabled them to start the hepatitis C treatment and to continue it when there was a problem,” said Talal. “They knew who to talk to in getting treated. If there were certain logistical barriers, the case managers helped patients to overcome those barriers.” The rising opioid epidemic runs parallel with the increasing rates of HCV infection, which affect a disproportionate number of people who inject drugs. Achieving SVR is a functional cure of HCV and eliminates transmission risk, thereby stopping further spread. Many barriers to care exist for those with OUD, including denial of access to HCV treatment due to stigma surrounding non-adherence and perceived risks of reinfection. In the study, OUD-specific barriers included competing healthcare priorities and insurance restrictions.2 Previous studies have explored the positive impacts of receiving HCV therapy in conjunction with OUD treatment. Addressing drug use-related harms, including overdose deaths, while administering HCV treatment can be a method to engage patients in OTPs in their overall health. Facilitated telemedicine for HCV offers patients treatment options available directly within OTPs, highlighting convenience and accessibility. “The facilitated telemedicine really integrates both a social component as well as a technical component,” said Talal. “Having a facilitator, a case manager, on site within the opioid treatment program really worked to build trust with patients. The technical component really comes from the ability to bring the hep C provider to that site, making it much more convenient for patients to engage in Hep C care at a place where they're already getting care treatment.” Investigators conducted 2 focus group discussions (FGD) with 9 participants who had previously taken part in a randomized controlled trial of facilitated telemedicine and were actively enrolled in OTPs 5 years post-achieving SVR. Participants had a mean age of 52.6 years (SD, 13.7), 66.6% were male, and 88.8% identified as White. Participants were engaged in the research process through a Patient Advisory Committee to provide individualized feedback on study conduct. The key endpoints were participant feedback to evaluate the long-term impact and sustainability to inform future policy development. The 3 FGD themes were as follows: attitudes towards HCV and barriers to treatment among people with OUD; embracing facilitated telemedicine for HCV care integrated into OTPs; and experiencing long-term benefits from facilitated telemedicine across all aspects of HCV care and overall well-being. Participants advocated for facilitated telemedicine’s convenience, empathetic clinicians, and “one-stop shop” approach. According to Talal, the future of HCV treatment in patient populations includes universal screening and the application of the facilitated telemedicine model to other settings, such as rural healthcare environments.

Los Blancos did secure another three-point haul in their most recent league outing, after making short work of Valencia to the tune of a 4-0 result last weekend. In midweek, however, Xabi Alonso’s troops were condemned to just a 2nd defeat of the season, at the hands of Liverpool in the Champions League.

    "text": "Ali Modu Sheriff, former governor of Borno state, has denied\nclaims that he accused Vice-President Kashim Shettima of creating Boko Haram,\ndescribing the report as “false, malicious, and dangerous”. A publication circulating online had quoted Sheriff as\nsaying, “It’s not me; it’s Shettima who created Boko Haram.” The report was first published\nin August 2016. But in a statement issued on Saturday, Sheriff dismissed the\nreport as a “complete fabrication” aimed at misleading the public and stirring\npolitical discord. “The said story is a complete fabrication, devoid of truth,\nand a deliberate attempt to mislead the public, malign the person of Senator\nSheriff, and sow discord within the nation’s political landscape,” the\nstatement reads. Sheriff said he never granted any interview or spoke to any\njournalist on the matter, adding that the falsehood was designed to undermine\nhis long-standing commitment to peace and national unity. “This false report is not only mischievous but also a\ndangerous piece of fake news aimed at undermining years of Senator Sheriff’s\ncontributions to peace, national unity, and development, both in Borno State\nand across Nigeria,” the statement added. The former governor urged members of the public and the\nmedia to disregard the publication, noting that he had directed his legal team\nto identify and pursue those behind the story. “Senator Sheriff has instructed his legal team to take\nimmediate steps to identify all individuals, bloggers, or media outlets\nresponsible for the dissemination of this defamatory material,” his media\noffice said. “Should the false publication not be retracted and taken\ndown forthwith, the Senator will not hesitate to seek full legal redress under\nthe law.” Sheriff reaffirmed his commitment to Nigeria’s security,\nstability, and democratic values and vowed to ensure that the spread of\nmisinformation does not go unpunished.",

    "title": "NFL Week 10 Preview: Heavyweight NFC clashes on tap",
    "text": "Week 10 in the NFL officially marks the beginning of the second half of the season, and it's also where we finally have a decent idea of who the true Super Bowl contenders are to watch in each conference. As luck would have it, the Week 10 slate gives us two matchups between NFC contenders in measuring stick games for all four clubs. Here's more on the two biggest matchups of the week, as well as some other key storylines to keep an eye on: Rams head to San Francisco with something to prove Take a look at the NFL Power Rankings this week, and in most of them, you'd find the Los Angeles Rams somewhere in the top three, if not the No. 1 spot. And with the way Matthew Stafford is playing right now, it's hard to argue against their spot at the top. In his 17th NFL season, Stafford leads the league with 21 passing touchdowns in eight games. In his past five games, the 37-year-old pivot has 1,408 yards, 16 TDs and zero interceptions, which has vaulted him right into the thick of the MVP conversation. But it's not just Stafford, as the Rams' defence has been doing its part, too. Over a three-game win streak, the Rams have allowed just 20 points total. Their last loss? A shocking overtime upset in Week 5 against their very opponent this weekend — the San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers have defied the odds all season. Devestated by injuries, head coach Kyle Shanahan has done a masterful job to keep his team not just afloat, but at 6-3, right in the race for a division title. Especially when you consider the 49ers are already 3-0 in NFC West division games, and have a chance to move to 4-0 on Sunday and take a real stranglehold on the in-division tiebreakers down the road. And just like they did when they stunned the Rams in Week 5, they'll once again lean on backup QB Mac Jones as Brock Purdy still appears a week away from returning to game action. But unlike in Week 5, this time San Francisco will be without the heart of its defence in linebacker Fred Warner, who is out for the season with an ankle injury. Conventional wisdom would say that this might be the week when the injuries finally catch up to the 49ers, especially with the roll the Rams are on right now. However, when these two teams play, nothing is a given. Per ESPN research, the 49ers' 26-23 OT win in Week 5 was the eighth game, including playoffs, between Shanahan and Rams head coach Sean McVay that has been decided by three points or less. That's the third most for any coaching matchup in NFL history. In other words, expect a tight one on Sunday. Packers looking to quiet the noise against Eagles It's not often you have a division leader this late in the season that could be described as \"desperate for a win.\" But for the Green Bay Packers, that's exactly the case. At 5-2-1, the Packers are atop the NFC North, but have all three teams in their division breathing down their neck. They are also coming off a disappointing loss to the Carolina Panthers last Sunday, in which they lost star TE Tucker Kraft for the season with an ACL injury. Kraft was the Packers' most important offensive player outside of QB Jordan Love this season, as he led the team in both receiving yards (489) and touchdowns (6). It's a huge void to fill, especially on Monday against the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles in a rematch of last season's wild-card round. And unlike the Packers, the Eagles are only getting more dangerous. Philadelphia made three trades ahead of Tuesday's trade deadline to bolster its defence, most notably bringing in edge rusher Jaelan Phillips from Miami. It's a tall task for the Packers, but if they truly want to be considered a Super Bowl contender this season, they have to show they're up for it. Otherwise, the panic level in Green Bay is going to reach new highs this season. Sauce's Colts debut goes international While it doesn't usually bring the excitement as the trade deadline in other leagues, there were some notable moves at the NFL's on Tuesday. None bigger than the Indianapolis Colts showing that they're all in this season by acquiring star cornerback Sauce Gardner from the New York Jets. It's a dramatic change in circumstances for Gardner, who goes from competing for the No. 1 pick in next year's draft to competing for the No. 1 seed in the AFC with the 7-2 Colts. And he gets to make his debut on the international stage, as the Colts kick Sunday's action off bright and early with a matchup against the Atlanta Falcons in Berlin. It's a perfect matchup to see how exactly the Colts plan to deploy Gardner moving forward, as Drake London is the clear top option for the Falcons' passing game. Will London have a Gardner shadow all game, or will the Colts use their new weapon in a different capacity? Either way, it's an exciting time to be a Colts fan. Game to watch: New England Patriots (7-2) @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-2) — Sunday, 1 p.m. ET The New England Patriots are absolutely one of the shocking stories of the first half of the season. Second-year QB Drake Maye is playing at an MVP level, and his team is in the AFC East driver's seat 10 weeks into the season. But without taking anything away from the Patriots, their schedule hasn't exactly been a gauntlet up to this point. After an impressive Week 5 win over the Buffalo Bills, the Patriots rattled off another four wins against the Saints, Titans, Browns and Falcons. That's four wins against teams with a combined record of 7-27. But Week 10 brings an intriguing test for these upstart Patriots, as they head on the road to take on Baker Mayfield and the 6-2 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. If the Patriots come out on top in this one, there should be zero questions left about whether they can really compete for a championship this season. Forrest's favourites (Season record: 14-10 — All odds courtesy of BetMGM): Cardinals @ Seahawks — Pick: Cardinals +7: The Cardinals look much better with Jacoby Brissett at quarterback. In a division game, take the points and ride with Brissett and the Cardinals. Ravens @ Vikings — Pick: Ravens -4: Don't look now, but the Ravens look primed for a second-half run with a healthy Lamar Jackson. Look for them to make a statement against the Vikings. Eagles @ Packers — Pick: Eagles +1: As mentioned earlier, there is a lot working against the Packers in this one. So take the defending Super Bowl champs to win on the road.

    "title": "Bustamante Hospital for Children receives major boost as critically ill patients are transferred from hurricane-hit hospitals in the west",
    "text": "KINGSTON, Jamaica — As hospitals in the north and west continue to reel from the effects of Hurricane Melissa, the Sandals Foundation has injected $6-million worth of equipment and resources to help the Bustamante Hospital for Children accept and care for the critically ill neonates, babies, and children who are being transferred to Kingston. A suite of machines and supplies, including a neonatal ventilator, infusion pump, blood gas analyser, catheter, blood pressure machine, humidifier, nebuliser/ suction machine, IV Pole, exam light and more, have been purchased by the philanthropic arm of Sandals Resorts International – building the capacity of the island’s only specialist paediatric hospital. “Four of our island’s major paediatric centres have been affected by the hurricane, so here at the Bustamante Hospital for Children, we have made a commitment that we will take the paediatric surgical patients, because we have the surgical specialists, the neonates, and any other sub-specialties such as cardiology, renal patients, and more,” said Chief Medical Officer at the Bustamante Hospital for Children Dr Michelle-Ann Dawson. “It’s going to be difficult for parents because some may have to be separated temporarily from their families, but we are also looking at how we can support the parents with care packages, with information, dialogue, and psychological support,” continued Dawson. Within days of the island being hit by the category 5 storm, members of the philanthropic organisation were in dialogue with the Ministry of Health and Wellness to determine critical resources needed to strengthen the services and capacity that were anticipated. Executive Director at the Sandals Foundation, Heidi Clake, said, “Our children and healthcare are two areas that resonate with us, especially in times of emergency. Being able to work alongside the Ministry of Health and our doctors and nurses that are working round the clock to serve those most affected – we are very pleased to be able to hand over this equipment that we hope will help in the weeks ahead until our other hospitals are able to recover.” Within hours of receiving the equipment from local suppliers, Jamaica Hospital Supplies and Medical Link, Head of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), Dr Carmen ‘Cindy’ Rhoden, reported success in caring for a patient that was transferred from the west. “We are happy that with your donations yesterday, we were able to give the best care to a preterm neonate 26 weeks gestation weighing only 830g that we accepted last night,” she said. The Bustamante Hospital for Children is the only specialist paediatric hospital in the English-speaking Caribbean and Jamaica’s major referral hospital. The institution, which serves patients 0-12 years old, provides a wide range of services including cardiology, neurology, asthma/respiratory, nephrology, neurosurgery, urology, ophthalmology, cardio-thoracic, and dental. For Dr Sharon McLean-Salmon, paediatric haematologist oncologist, the donated supplies will also enhance the care of patients with cancers and serious blood disorders. “We have received two equipment which are essential for our team in terms of managing patients who are affected with cancer and who need intense monitoring to ensure that they are stable and doing well while receiving lifesaving treatment.” According to the United Nations, around 1.5 million Jamaicans have been impacted by the Category 5 storm, with seven parishes being the most significantly affected. The Bustamante Hospital in Kingston will provide a place of refuge for patients from the paediatric centres at the Savanna-la-Mar Public General Hospital in Westmoreland, the Black River Hospital in St Elizabeth, Cornwall Regional Hospital in St James, and the Falmouth Hospital in Trelawny. Representatives from the Sandals Foundation, the Bustamante Hospital for Children, Medical Link delivery team share a moment with a portion of the suite of equipment donated by the Sandals Foundation to build the capacity of the hospital to accept and care for critically ill patients being transferred from western affected hospitals.

    "title": "Royal Family LIVE: Andrew faces major embarrassment this week as Parliament gets involved",
    "text": "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor is set to face major embarrassment this week as a ban gets lifted by Parliament. The 65-year-old was stripped of his royal titles, including his princely title, and will soon leave the 30-room Royal Lodge, which has been his home since 2003. When Parliament returns from a brief recess on Tuesday, Liberal Democrat MPs will press the Government on Andrew’s Royal Lodge arrangements. As reported by The Times, this will include any advice being provided by ministers on the size of his payout for vacating the property. By convention, MPs are not allowed to criticise royals in the Commons. However, with recent news of the stripping of his title, Andrew is now a commoner. According to parliamentary officials, he has now lost any immunity from receiving scrutiny. WELCOME TO OUR LIVE BLOG. PLEASE FIND THE LATEST ROYAL UPDATES BELOW. King Charles's \"hot equerry\", Lieutenant Colonel Jonny Thompson, has made a new appearance today, and royal fans took notice. Major Jonny Thompson, often dubbed \"Major Eye Candy\" by royal fans for his brooding good looks, was carrying the King’s wreath on Remembrance Sunday during the poignant ceremony at the Cenotaph in London. Fans were delighted to see the King’s aide once again and took to social media to express their jubilation. Andrew Mountbatten Windsor is allegedly “terrified” to face the US Congress after the latest wave of humiliation, a royal expert has claimed. The disgraced brother of King Charles, who saw all his titles and honours axed by the King, has now been asked to appear before the House Oversight Committee for a \"transcribed interview\" in connection with his \"long-standing friendship\" with the convicted paedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. In the letter, sent to the former prince on Thursday, the US politicians said their committee had identified \"financial records containing notations such as 'massage for Andrew' that raise serious questions\". The letter was co-signed by 16 Democratic committee members. It requested a response by November 20. Now, royal expert Phil Dampier said that the letter is yet another “embarrassment” for the Royal Family, who want to move on from Andrew’s scandal. The Prince and Princess of Wales have issued a powerful and moving message following their attendance today at the annual Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph. King Charles led the nation in honouring those who have died in conflict in a touching ceremony in London, attended by thousands of veterans and senior members of the Royal Family. Following the ceremony, William and Kate took to their official social media account to post a poignant video of today’s events and share the message: “Each year it is an honour to take part in Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph in London alongside other members of the Royal Family and in front of veterans and their families. Lest We Forget.” Sarah Ferguson has not been dealing well with the aftermath of the latest bombshells regarding her links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and believes she is “blameless” despite the furore, sources have claimed. The former Duchess of York, who lost her title and her home, after her ex-husband, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, with whom she still lives at Royal Lodge, faced yet another fall from grace, after new details emerged of his relationship with the disgraced US financier, which led to the King stripping him of his titles and honours. A source close to her said the whole scandal has taken its toll on her, but she remains defiant, insisting she’s blameless in it all. EXCLUSIVE: After watching King Charles lead the nation in a two-minute silence to honour those who have died in conflict during Sunday's emotional Remembrance Day service, the monarch's wife, Queen Camilla, and Princess Kate struggled to keep their true feelings hidden. The pair watched the proceedings together from the balcony of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, overlooking the Cenotaph. They observed wreaths being laid by the King, his eldest son, Prince William, and other members of the royal family, alongside senior politicians and high commissioners from the Commonwealth of Nations. Good afternoon, I'm Sophia Papamavroudi and I'll be bringing you all the latest royal updates into this evening. Feel free to get in touch with me as I work at sophia.papamavroudi@reachplc.com Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were seen arriving hand-in-hand to celebrate Kris Jenner's 70th birthday on Saturday evening. The couple were two of the 300 guests in attendance, as the event was taking place at Jeff Bezos’s Beverly Hills estate. King Charles made an emotional appearance at today's Remembrance Day service at the Cenotaph in London. The 76-year-old appeared moved as he took part in a two-minute silence to remember the sacrifices of the many servicemen and women who gave their lives in service to their country. Prince George surprised royal fans last night when he stepped out with senior royals to attend the Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall. The young prince, 12, accompanied his mum, Princess Kate, to the event, where they joined King Charles, Queen Camilla and other members of the family. Sarah Ferguson's true feelings about Andrew have been unveiled, with the 66-year-old said to feel that she is \"blameless\".

King Charles is set to \"switch off from his personal dramas\" as he commemorates Remembrance Sunday today, according to former Royal butler Grant Harrold who served the King at Highgrove House. Harrold revealed that the late Queen Elizabeth II enforced a \"three line whip\" for The Firm on Remembrance Sunday, with many royals having served in the Armed Forces and the Queen's own uncle Fergus Bowes-Lyon tragically killed in action during the Battle of Loos. Meghan Markle has officially made a return to her acting roots by announcing her role in a new movie, which is being filmed in Pasadena, California.

    "title": "US grounds MD-11 cargo planes after deadly crash",
    "text": "Share Options WASHINGTON: The US civil aviation regulator ordered Saturday that all MD-11 cargo planes remain grounded for inspections, after one of them was involved in a deadly crash in Kentucky this week. A McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft operated by UPS exploded into flames when it crashed shortly after departing Tuesday from the airport in Louisville, killing at least 14 people. A three-person crew was aboard. Freight carriers UPS and FedEx later grounded their MD-11 fleets, while Boeing, which owns McDonnell Douglas, said it had recommended that all operators suspend their use of the planes. On Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency directive that “prohibits further flight until the airplane is inspected and all applicable corrective actions are performed.” The directive applies to the MD-11 and MD-11F models and says it “was prompted by an accident where the left-hand engine and pylon detached from the airplane during takeoff.” “The agency has determined the unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design,” it said. On Friday, UPS said it had decided to “temporarily ground” its MD-11s “out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of safety.” It said the model accounts for around nine percent of its fleet. FedEx said Saturday it, too, had grounded its 28 MD-11s out of a total fleet of around 700 aircraft as it conducts a safety review. Both carriers said they were acting on a recommendation from the plane’s manufacturer. McDonnell Douglas originally made the MD-11 but was acquired by Boeing in 1997. Boeing said it had “recommended to the three operators of the MD-11 Freighter that they suspend flight operations while additional engineering analysis is performed.” The only other carrier using the MD-11 is Western Global Airlines. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said another crash victim had been located, bringing the total number to 14. “Please pray for these families, the Louisville community and everyone affected by this terrible event,” he said on X. Trail of debris The plane, filled with around 38,000 gallons (144,000 liters) of fuel for the long-haul flight to Hawaii, narrowly missed a major Ford vehicle assembly plant that employs about 3,000 people. Aerial footage of the crash site showed a long trail of debris as firefighters doused the flames, with smoke billowing from the area. Todd Inman, a member of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said this week that investigators had identified the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder—known as a plane’s black boxes—and would send them to Washington for analysis. The crash was reportedly the deadliest in UPS history. Its main hub, Worldport, is in Louisville, where it employs thousands of people. According to the NTSB, the plane was built in 1991 and was modified into a cargo aircraft. The crash comes amid the longest government shutdown in US history, with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warning this week of “mass chaos” in the skies due to a lack of air traffic control staff. Inman said the NTSB was not aware of any staff shortages at Louisville’s airport at the time of the crash. — AFP Share Options",

    "text": "The University of Idaho unveiled a statue of its mascot, Joe Vandal, in front of the P1FCU Kibbie Dome on Saturday prior to the team’s football game against UC Davis. The 9-foot-tall statue with a 5-foot-wide base and weighing approximately 2,000 pounds is a way that UI is recognizing its Associated Students of Idaho (ASUI). The group is known for its decades-long support for the Kibbie Dome and other campus resources and facilities. “As we celebrate our 50th year in the P1FCU Kibbie Dome, it’s fitting to add a tribute to the University of Idaho students and their contributions to this facility,” University of Idaho President C. Scott Green said. “The Dome has become a beloved gathering place for students, alumni and our entire community, that would not exist without the steadfast support of our students.” In 1974, the ASUI voted to allocate student fees to add a roof to the dome and make other improvements to what is now a nationally recognized landmark on the Moscow campus. Also honored at the event were ASUI President Seyi Arogundade and artist and sculptor Gareth Curtiss. Curtiss collaborated with Idaho students, alumni, employees and community members to create and refine the design of the statue. “While leaning into the future, Vandals honor decades of student support,” Green said on Monday in a news release. “We look forward to unveiling this symbol of the Vandal spirit as a timeless monument to the generous contributions of our Vandal student body, past and present.” Green said that the Kibbie Dome, which has been built with the help of student fees, is important to UI history and has helped host many events that the University puts on. “We appreciate the thousands of students who contributed student fees over the years to make the Dome a reality,” Green said. “We’re proud that this stadium is not just a football venue, it’s a world-class indoor track and field stadium, it hosts our Vandal soccer games, a variety of intramural sports, our commencement ceremonies and many other events throughout the year.” Junt can be reached at 208-848-2258, tjunt@lmtribune.com or on X (formerly Twitter) @TrevorJunt.",

    "title": "Asking Eric: Is it weird to announce our divorce, change in names in holiday cards?",
    "text": "Dear Eric: My dilemma is about Christmas cards. I am separated from my husband of 25 years, and while it’s mostly amicable, I feel disingenuous including him on the card this year. Our divorce will be final less than a month after Christmas. I am also going back to my maiden name so I thought it might be a good way to announce that as well. We share four children (and a cat) who I’d like to include. Any ideas on wording that is classy or funny to express this new family identity that doesn’t skew weird or inappropriate? – I’d Still Like to Wish You a Merry Christmas Dear Merry Christmas: Hmm, this was an interesting challenge. Perhaps something like “There’s a new name, and a new family arrangement, but the warm wishes are the same.” Or you could lean into a seasonal motif: “This holiday, we’re moving into a new season of life, so you’ll see a different name on the return address but know that my love for you lasts year-round.” Or funny: “Is it regifting when Santa brings you your maiden name for Christmas?” Perhaps follow that last one up with a sincere sentence or two to reassure folks that everyone is happy and healthy. There’s also a simple solution of taking a photo of yourself with your kids and cat, signing it with your maiden name, and letting people infer or speak to you directly if they want more information. There are some who advise against announcing divorces in holiday greetings because divorce can be sad. However, it’s your card and your life and you don’t have to hide it. Holiday cards and letters often encompass the full breadth of what goes on in a year – love, loss, and all the rest. So, if you want to share it, do. Readers, I invite you to improve upon my work. If you’ve written or received other holiday greetings from folks announcing a divorce, please send it in. I’ll publish some of them in a column next month so that you can put them to use in future years. Dear Eric: We have given Christmas gifts to eight of our son’s friends since middle school. I recently retired and do not make the kind of money I used to. I want to tactfully tell them that I love them all dearly but need to stop gifting. They do not gift us, nor do I ever see them open their gifts. So, I really don’t get the joy out of it anymore. Can you help? —Gift Giver Dear Giver: You’re basically already there with what you’ve written to me. A card or note that tells them you love them all dearly but that your circumstances are changing and so you need to end the tradition should suffice. You can even say less if you’d like and just send them a card that announces, “we’re switching to cards for Christmas. Still love you lots!” Send questions to R.

    "title": "Retired from the Navy, but still plenty busy",
    "text": "From jamming enemy radar in the Persian Gulf to running chili feeds at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post in Lewiston, Navy veteran Rockey A. Davis stays busier than a deckhand on swabbing duty. Much of his life’s work always kept him close to the ocean, even nowadays living near this nation’s farthest inland seaport. “When I was a service officer, the St. Maries veterans all said they moved there because they wanted to get away from the water,” says the 73-year-old Davis with a laugh. He doesn’t mind the ocean one way or the other, but he doesn’t miss it after being deployed five times on five different aircraft carriers: the USS Kitty Hawk, the USS Forrestal, the USS Nimitz, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the USS Abraham Lincoln. He retired in 1995 with the rank of aviation electrician’s mate senior chief, after seeing action during conflicts across the world. While most Americans watched the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis play out on the nightly news, Davis was a young sailor on the USS Kitty Hawk, which was sent to the North Arabian Sea to support air operations. The crisis began after Iranian students overran the U.S. embassy, taking 66 U.S. citizens hostage and holding 52 of them for 444 days. To Davis and his crewmates, the situation felt tense. “All of the sudden there were T-shirts saying, ‘Nuke ’em till they glow,’ ” Davis recalls. Davis had other deployments in that part of the world during times of conflict. He was also there to help enforce the no-fly zone in the Persian Gulf after Gulf War One. During that time, he worked with radar-jamming missions that ended up with the bombing of surface-to-air missile sites. He says he didn’t feel threatened despite the deadly warfare. “I felt safe,” Davis says. “We had fighters and aggressive aircraft, bombers.” Comfort with weapons has translated to his community service work. Davis volunteers at the Lewis-Clark Wildlife Club’s public shooting range east of Lapwai on Tom Beall Road. He works as a range officer there, helping take care of the facility. He also volunteers on his church’s security team, carrying a weapon and creating plans in case the church is attacked. “Everyone on our security team is armed,” he says. Davis and his wife have two kids, who also served in the military. He had a second career as a veterans service officer for the state of Idaho for 10 years. Today he is in his second year as commander of VFW Post 10043, which has 359 members, making it the state’s second-largest post behind Boise. Recently, he started partnering with Serengeti Care of Lewiston to help raise money for people who need home health services. The first fundraiser was a chili cookoff in October. The VFW will host a bakeoff this month. Ferguson can be reached at dferguson@lmtribune.com.",

    "text": "The UK's most luxurious hospital has opened its doors in London, boasting unlimited caviar and Andy Warhol artwork adorning the walls – with stays setting you back a cool £750 per night. Memorial Houston Medical (MhM) is pioneering a \"design-first approach\" to medical recovery - referencing studies which suggest that patients exposed to art experience improved recovery rates. The post-op facility, originally established in Texas, believes the scientific field of \"neuroaesthetics\", which explores how the brain reacts to beauty and art, is fundamental to its design. Read more: Police get special Birmingham city centre powers Patients recuperating from cancer treatment, cardiology procedures, hip replacements, and diabetic foot disease, among other conditions, can convalesce in one of the building's six patient suites or three outpatient rooms - featuring artwork such as a £50,000 Andy Warhol portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. According to the hospital chiefs, the facility, which opened earlier this year, provides \"five-star standards\" in a former jewellery shop, situated on Fulham Road, South Kensington. Art from Warhol, Sir Peter Blake, and José María García graces the walls throughout the building, while Lebanese haute couture designer Elie Saab has provided specially commissioned furniture. A 15-ft ceiling mural depicting the streets and waterways of London in gold leaf embellishes the top floor – while meals are served on bespoke crockery designed by Lebanese ceramicist Helen Zughaib. The building boasts materials such as calcutta marble, bronzed brass, and eucalyptus wood. The design features are said to \"create aesthetic balance\" for patients during their recovery. Those seeking treatment at the centre will be charged £750 per night, which includes a three-course dinner and afternoon tea, with a family member allowed to stay with the patient at no extra cost. A physiotherapist is also available on-site at a rate of £200 per hour, while minor procedures including a vitamin B12 injection (£80) and dermal fillers (starting from £250) are also on offer. Danny Shebaclo, vice president of business affairs at MhM, commented: \"The opening of our inpatient services marks an extraordinary milestone, not only for MhM but for the evolution of healthcare in the UK. \"Our vision is to offer a deeply considered, human-first approach to medicine, where design, dignity, and medical innovation come together. \"We are proud to offer the UK a facility where patients are cared for with world-class expertise, total discretion, and unparalleled comfort.\" Amy Forrest, senior architect at LSI Architects, who were involved in the building's transformation, stated: \"This was about more than aesthetics. \"It was about crafting spaces that actively participate in the patient's healing process. \"From the material palette to spatial volume and lighting, every detail has been guided by how it makes the patients feel.\"",

    "text": "MLB pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz charged with taking bribes to rig pitches for bettors NEW YORK (AP) — Two Major League Baseball pitchers have been indicted on charges they took bribes to give sports bettors advance notice of the types of pitches they’d throw and intentionally tossed balls instead of strikes to ensure successful bets. Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz both pitched for the Cleveland Guardians. They have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July while Major League Baseball investigated what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when they pitched. A lawyer for Ortiz declined to comment when contacted by The Associated Press and a lawyer for Clase did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Paul Tagliabue, NFL commissioner of 17 years who led an era of riches and expansion, dies at 84 NEW YORK (AP) — Paul Tagliabue, who helped bring labor peace and riches to the NFL during his 17 years as commissioner but was criticized for not taking stronger action on concussions, died Sunday from heart failure at 84 years old. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Tagliabue’s family informed the league of his death in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Tagliabue, who had developed Parkinson’s disease, was commissioner from 1989, when he succeeded Pete Rozelle, to 2006. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of a special centennial class in 2020. Current Commissioner Roger Goodell succeeded Tagliabue. Donald Trump plans to be the 1st sitting US president at a regular-season NFL game since 1978 LANDOVER, Md. (AP) — Extra security measures are in place before the Washington Commanders’ game against the Detroit Lions, where President Donald Trump planned to become the first sitting president in nearly a half-century to attend a regular-season NFL contest. Officers in black secret uniforms identifying them as members of the U.S. Secret Service joined military, police and other guards inside and outside Northwest Stadium on Sunday. There were more fences than usual blocking sidewalks and some pathways were restricted. Only two other times did a president go to an NFL game during the regular season while in office, according to the league: Richard Nixon in 1969 and Jimmy Carter in 1978. Texas returns to top 10, ACC has five teams ranked in the Top 25 and there is Group of Five intrigue Texas has returned to the top 10 in The Associated Press college football poll. The Longhorns, ranked No. 10, are set to visit No. 5 Georgia this week. They had dropped out of the top 25 after losing to Florida several weeks ago. Ohio State remains No. 1, followed by Indiana, Texas A&M, Alabama, and Georgia. The ACC has five teams ranked, including Georgia Tech and Miami. The Group of Five conferences are represented by James Madison and South Florida. Man City crushes Liverpool 3-0 in Pep Guardiola's 1,000th game MANCHESTER, England (AP) — In his 1000th game as a manager, Pep Guardiola celebrated victory as if it was his first. Manchester City’s 3-0 win against Liverpool was number 716 for Guardiola and likely one of his most satisfying of his trophy-laden career. Not only did City totally dominate the defending Premier League champion and one of Guardiola’s fiercest rivals in a career spanning Spain, Germany and England - but victory firmly established his team as the one most likely to run Arsenal closest for the title this season. City moved up to second in the standings - just four points behind the leader, with a well-established record when it comes to chasing down Arsenal. Taylor runs for 244 yards and 3 TDs for Colts in 31-25 OT win over Falcons in Berlin BERLIN (AP) — Jonathan Taylor completed a 244-yard rushing day with an 8-yard touchdown run in overtime to give the Indianapolis Colts a 31-25 victory over the Atlanta Falcons in the first regular-season NFL game in Berlin, Germany. It was Taylor’s third touchdown of the game and came after Colts kicker Michael Badgley tied the game with a 44-yard field goal with 25 seconds left. Tyler Allgeier’s second touchdown was a 1-yard plunge that give the Falcons a 25-22 lead with 1:44 left in regulation. McLaren driver Lando Norris wins Formula 1's Brazilian Grand Prix SAO PAULO (AP) — McLaren driver Lando Norris has significantly extended his lead in the F1 championship after winning the Brazilian Grand Prix. His main rival and teammate Oscar Piastri received a 10-second penalty and again failed to make the podium. Norris also won Saturday’s sprint race and started from pole position. He earned his first win at Interlagos with Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen second and third. Norris now has 390 points in the standings, with Piastri’s fifth place leaving him 24 points behind on 366 with three more races to go. Four-time world champion Verstappen has 341 points. Madrid stumbles again with 0-0 draw at Rayo Vallecano in Spanish league MADRID (AP) — Real Madrid has been held by Rayo Vallecano to a 0-0 draw in the Spanish league for its second consecutive setback following a Champions League loss at Liverpool. Madrid’s attack struggled and was scoreless again after having found the net in every match this season until the 1-0 loss at Liverpool on Tuesday. Madrid remains top of the Spanish league. It's five points ahead of second-placed Villarreal but Barcelona can move within three points of the leader by beating Celta Vigo later Sunday. Packers couldn't stop Eagles' tush push during offseason. Now they'll try to contain it on the field GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — The Green Bay Packers couldn’t thwart the tush push during the offseason. Now they must try to find a way to stop it in a game. Green Bay proposed a ban on the play during the offseason. The measure was approved by more than two-thirds of the teams but fell two votes short of passage. That has enabled the Philadelphia Eagles to continue using the short-yardage play in their Super Bowl title defense. The Eagles beat the Packers twice last season and face them again Monday night at Lambeau Field. Sauce Gardner laments misses in Colts debut, but loves 'electric' locker room after win BERLIN (AP) — Indianapolis Colts cornerback Sauce Gardner was thinking about a pick-6. It would have been quite a debut with his new team. He jumped a route but Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr.’s pass intended for Drake London went through Gardner’s hands, hit his midsection and bounced incomplete. He says “I was trying to score, so I was already looking at the end zone.” Still, the Colts left Berlin with a 31-25 overtime victory over Indianapolis that will soothe Gardner’s disappointment. It’s the type of play the Colts were hoping for when they traded two first-round draft picks and receiver Adonai Mitchell to the New York Jets on Tuesday to get one of the league’s premier cover cornerbacks.

    "text": "Topic:Stock Market The ASX is enjoying a solid start to the week, with shares closing up around 0.8 per cent higher thanks to demand for gold and lithium stocks. ANZ jumped more than 3 per cent despite posting a 10 per cent slide in profit, while RBA deputy governor Andrew Hauser's \"hawkish\" comments have strengthened the case against rate cuts in the short-term. Look back on how the session unfolded, plus financial news and insights from our specialist business reporters on our blog. Disclaimer: this blog is not intended as investment advice. By Stephen Letts Prices current around 4:15pm AEDT Live updates on the major ASX indices: By Stephen Letts That's it for another day on the blog, thanks for your company. The ASX 200 enjoyed its best day in three weeks, with perhaps the most surprising performance being ANZ's 3.2% jump on announcing 14% slide in cash profits, which was at best in-line with consensus forecasts and result some analysts described as \"messy\". It was not such a great day for former ANZ boss Shayne Elliott who forfeited $13.5 million in bonuses on the back of number of expensive regulatory \"issues\" the bank had with ASIC. Gold jumped back above $US4,000/ounce sparking a rally in local miners, while lithium, uranium and rare earth miners also jumped. Looking ahead, Wall Street looks likely to benefit from the news that the US senate had passed a bill to end the federal government shutdown. S&P 500 futures are up 0.7%, Nasdaq futures point to a 1.2% gain. However, there are still a few more hurdles, including White House approval, before furloughed workers can get back on the tools. We'll be back bright and early tomorrow morning with all the developments to set you up for another captivating day viewed through the eyes of the ABC business unit. Missing you already, until next time ... By Stephen Letts The ASX 200 enjoyed a strong day, gaining across the session to close 0.75% higher at 8,836 points. It was the index's best day in three weeks. The broad-based industrial sector was a standout, supported by solid rises in Monadelphous (+11.1%) and Austal (+5.2%), while speciality miners, the tech and financial sectors were also in demand. The supermarkets were largely out of favour, while property was dragged down by sector heavyweight Goodman Group slipping 1.3% and Centuria (-2.2%). The miners were a mixed bag, with the big iron ore producers underperforming (honourable mention to Rio Tinto, up 0.6%) after another drop in their spot prices out of China on Friday. Gold miners were uniformly back in town as their spot price jumped back above $US4,000/ounce. Lithium producers did even better with Liontown Resources up almost 13%. Uranium miners were also in the money, with the key players up between 6-to-10%. Banks and insurers were generally higher. ANZ (+3.2%) led the \"big four\" retail banks after posting full-year results this morning, while QBE insurance gained 1.3% on a broker upgrade. Macquarie Group (+0.6%) retraced some of its sharp 5% sell off on Friday. Tech stocks made late gains after a slow start. By sector, non-cyclical consumer stocks (aka the supermarkets) were the weakest. The top movers on the ASX 200 include Liontown Resources, mining services outfit Monadelphous on strong results and positive guidance, as well as a host of uranium miners. Dyno Nobel (+7.9%) also did well after a well-received full-year result. The ASX bottom movers include property settlements platform PEXA (-4.3%) and property group, Centuria Capital (-2.2%). By Stephen Letts Having a bit of DroneShield moment on the blog at the moment. Eagle-eyed reader Craig points out Nasdaq futures are up a stonking 1.2%, which is correct, not the 0.2% decline I tapped out. Thanks Craig. By Stephen Letts The big news in the US at the moment is that the Senate has advanced a bill aimed at ending the 40-day (so far) federal government shutdown. Reaction on Wall Street has been mixed, with S&P 500 and Dow futures pointing to solid gains tonight, while the Nasdaq looks like enduring another retreat. At 3:50pm (AEDT): By Stephen Letts What impact has the Suncorp Bank acquisition had on ANZ's results? - Andy Smith Hi Andy, Suncorp received a mention in the \"September Half 2025 Significant Items\" summary along with the likes of staff redundancies (after-tax charge of $414 million), the ASIC settlement (after-tax charge of $261 million) and the PT Panin impairment (after-tax charge of $285 million). ANZ had already flagged last month plans to complete the integration of Suncorp Bank by June 2027 to \"accelerate value creation for shareholders\". In its accounts, ANZ recognised an after-tax charge of $68 million in relation to the Suncorp migration ... to the bank, sort of like the change you or I would lose under the couch, and it hasn't cracked a mention in the analyst reports that have come across the blog's desk today. By Stephen Letts The Australian dollar is off on a bit of a frolic this afternoon, jollied along by hopes the US federal government shutdown may soon be over, as well as fairly \"hawkish\" comments from RBA deputy governor Andrew Hauser. The Aussie is currently up 0.4% to 65.16 US cents (at 3:20pm AEDT). This follows its 0.8% slide last week. \"It does look as though the Aussie is taking heart from the apparent end to the US political stalemate that is boosting US equity futures in anticipation of a rebound in the US economy,\" ITC senior analyst Sean Callow said. \"RBA's Hauser may have also helped the Aussie at the margin, with his comments reinforcing the hawkish lean of the November meeting.\" In a speech in Sydney, Hauser noted the starting point for Australia's economic recovery last year was the tightest in more than 40 years, suggesting little urgency to ease policy soon. He later said financial conditions are closer to neutral rates now. \"This was a further hawkish evolution of the RBA's characterisation at the November (Statement on Monetary Policy),\" NAB senior economist Taylor Nugent wrote in a note. \"NAB expects the RBA to be firmly on hold before a final cut in May 2026, but risks are skewed to a 3.6% terminal cash rate for the cycle.\" With Reuters By Stephanie Chalmers Reserve Bank deputy governor Andrew Hauser was in conversation with UBS chief economist George Tharenou at the investment bank's conference in Sydney today. Now Mr Tharenou and his economics team have released a note with their take on the chat. The headline? Hauser was on the hawkish side, UBS concludes. \"This was consistent with the UBS view that the RBA will hold the cash rate unchanged ahead, with a terminal rate of 3.6%,\" the note read. \"Looking forward, we think the RBA's assessment is increasingly that the outlook for inflation depends on the balance of supply and demand. In economic terms — the 'output gap', or 'spare capacity'… \"We discussed various scenarios, but Hauser cited 'credence' to the hawkish scenario, 'fearing that the economy may find itself boxed in by its own capacity constraints, like a racehorse trapped against the course fence, unable to surge forward. On that view, there may be little scope for demand growth to rise further without adding to inflationary pressures, and hence there may be little room for further policy easing.'\" By Stephen Letts It was shaping up as another heady day for ASX 200 newbie and investor sweetheart DroneShield, bouncing out of the blocks with shares up 9% on news of $7.6 million dollars' worth of new contracts with the US government. A couple of hours later, DroneShield sheepishly withdrew the statement, noting the same contracts had previously been announced in September. DroneShield duly plummeted back to earth and is now down 0.5% in the day. Clunk. In its follow-up statement to the ASX, DroneShield said the mistake was \"inadvertent\" and the company \"is taking steps to prevent this error occurring again\". By Stephen Letts Former ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott has paid a hefty price for the bank's run-in with ASIC over its mistreatment of customers and misconduct relating to trading in Australian government bonds. The ANZ's annual report released with its result this morning show Mr Elliott was \"not eligible\" for his long-term bonus payment of $13.49 million. Mr Elliot left the bank in May and was replaced by Nuno Matos. The ANZ board's chair of the people and culture committee, Holly Kramer, noted in the executive remuneration report that the bank was \"mindful\" of shareholder feedback in the strike it received against its 2024 remuneration report. Along with Mr Elliott, three former executives, including the former head of the Australian retail banking operations, Maile Carnegie, saw their share bonuses, which were due to vest later this year, forfeited. In Ms Carnegie's case, the cost was $4.4 million. \"The board determined that some or all equity due to vest in November/December 2025 would be forfeited to ensure overall consequences were appropriate and proportionate,\" Ms Kramer said. The total penalties ANZ racked up with ASIC over four different matters came in at $240 million — the highest in Australian corporate history — including the \"unconscionable conduct\" on a major commonwealth bond deal, and misconduct affecting about 65,000 customers. UBS bank analyst John Storey described the senior executives forfeiting parts of variable compensation as \"a positive on  cultural change\" at the bank. By Michael Janda Marc Sumerlin, a former George W Bush economic adviser who has been in the mix of candidates for US Federal Reserve chair, says the two biggest risks to the US economic outlook are a weakening jobs market and the risk of an AI bubble. \"I think the biggest risks are: the economy's just weaker than we think and we're behind the curve, and we can observe that the unemployment rate has been drifting up for two years,\" he told journalists at a media roundtable (it was actually a rectangular table) at the UBS investment conference this morning. \"So no-one knows what [the] neutral [interest rate] is but we know we've been above neutral just by that ... So that's the biggest risk. \"And then the second biggest risk is that, on the other side, we do not have a credit bubble yet, we have high valuations, but if we make monetary policy too easy, we could be inflating the bubble.\" Sumerlin said most AI investment so far has come from corporate cashflows, but it looks like the next wave of mega investments will require debt funding, raising broader financial sector risks. \"We don't have the debt acceleration yet, but it feels like we're at the start of it,\" he warned. Sumerlin also pointed to the wealth effect in the US keeping consumption high, but that could collapse if wealth suddenly started to evaporate. \"It's very difficult to have a recession in the US when the stock market is up, but if the stock market drops 20% we could be extremely vulnerable,\" he cautioned. Kirsten Aiken is speaking with Marc Sumerlin this afternoon in an interview that will air on The Business tonight. You can watch The Business at 8:44pm AEDT on ABC News Channel or any time after 7:30pm on ABC iView. By Michael Janda Marc Sumerlin, once an economic adviser to former US president George W Bush and currently the managing partner of consultancy Evenflow Macro, is out in Sydney as part of the UBS conference. Sumerlin confirmed several months ago that he is in the mix of candidates being considered to replace Jerome Powell as the next US Federal Reserve chair. This morning he held an on-the-record discussion with a small group of financial journalists, myself included. I asked him why Donald Trump's tariffs didn't appear to be having as much upwards effect on US inflation as many analysts feared and whether they would put more pressure on price levels next year. \"They're a tax. To the extent they're borne by the consumer, the consumer is going to have lower after-tax income. And so, a year out, inflation should be lower in my mind,\" he responded. Sumerlin says the tariffs currently in place are the equivalent of a 1% of GDP tax on Americans, worth about $US300 billion in additional revenue. From an inflationary perspective, he's more worried about the tax cuts legislated by the Trump administration, which are also equivalent to about 1% of US GDP and take effect next year. \"We have a tax cut coming next year. So the One Big Beautiful Bill didn't change taxes in 2025 but it does in 2026. So you would have to be thinking about ... how much of a fiscal push you have coming and whether that would provide the income to have more inflation.\" However, overall, Sumerlin believes a weakening US jobs market, a stagnant housing market (including rents), and stable to falling oil prices should keep inflation under control, even if the Fed cuts interest rates a little bit further.

By Yiying Li Prices current around 12:53pm AEDT Live updates on the major ASX indices: By Stephanie Chalmers The local share market is posting decent gains as we approach mid-session, with the ASX 200 up 0.6% at the moment, building on its early momentum. Mining and energy stocks remain among some of the best performers so far, while ANZ is outperforming its banking peers, with shares up 2.3% despite reporting a 10% profit drop. The best performing stock so far: And the worst performers: By Stephanie Chalmers In some breaking news out of Washington DC, the US Senate has moved towards a vote on a bill that would end the federal government shutdown, now in its 40th day — the longest in history. Senators were set to vote on Sunday night, local time, on advancing a bill passed by the House of Representatives that will be amended to combine the short-term funding measure, which would fund the government through to January 2026, with a package of three full-year appropriations bills, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said. The amended package would still have to be passed by the House of Representatives and sent to US President Donald Trump for his signature, a process that could take several days. It comes as unpaid federal workers have told ABC News of turning to food banks or draining their savings to get by, while thousands of flights have been delayed or cancelled. You can read more from Reuters on the developing story: By Stephanie Chalmers In good news for anyone forecasting another interest rate cut this cycle, which we should note includes some of the major bank economists, the RBA's deputy governor doesn't think you're completely off your rocker! \"There are still worlds you could imagine where rates are cut,\" Andrew Hauser said in Sydney, speaking at the UBS Australasia Conference. Mr Hauser spoke about whether Australia's economy was \"boxed in\" by capacity constraints or whether it could \"break free\" through higher productivity. On the topic of whether there are further interest rate cuts to come, Mr Hauser said for that to happen you'd have to think that there's more spare capacity than current data suggests, or be pessimistic about the outlook for demand growth, or think that capacity pressures only have a weak effect on inflation. \"The CPI number we've obviously seen come out is a challenge for that view,\" Mr Hauser said. \"You'd have to believe that most of it was a one-off, volatile … recovery that was shortly going to unwind. \"You'd probably take a view about the labour market, that it was weaker and looser than our central projection. \"GDP you could be pessimistic about, consumer confidence in Australia is pretty weak, and you could of course worry about the world … tariffs may still prove to have more of an effect.\" Mr Hauser noted that tariff effects that could still potentially play out could be China flooding the Australian market with cheap goods, putting downward pressure on inflation, or financial markets repricing downwards. \"I don't think you have to be mad, or sort of a fanatic, to think that future rate cuts could be coming. \"More plausibly, perhaps, at the moment, you might worry about how much remaining room there is.\" You can read more from Mr Hauser's prepared remarks (below) from David Taylor: By Stephen Letts The ASX 200 has opened 0.2% higher with buying evident across most sectors (at 11am AEDT). The broad-based industrial sector is the standout, supported by strong gains in DroneShield (+8.7%), Monadelphous (+8.2%) and Austal (+4.2%), while the mining and financial sectors are also in demand. The supermarkets, utilities and property trusts are out of favour this morning. The miners are a mixed bag, with the big iron ore producers underperforming after another drop in their spot prices out of China on Friday. Lithium producers are the big movers in the mining sector this morning, with Liontown Resources up almost 9%. Uranium miners are also doing well, which is supporting the energy sector. Banks and insurers are generally higher, with ANZ (+0.5%) leading the \"big four\" retail banks after posting full-year results this morning, while QBE insurance is up 1.8%. Macquarie Group (+1.6%) has retraced some of its sharp 5% sell off on Friday. In the consumer non-cyclical sector, most of the supermarkets are out of favour, with both Coles and Woolworths down around 1%. The top movers on the ASX 200 include Liontown Resources, mining services outfit Monadelphous on strong results and positive guidance, and DroneShield after announcing another defence contract in the US. Dyno Nobel is also doing well after a well-received full-year result. The ASX bottom movers include Seek (-2.4%) and fuel retailer and refiner Viva Energy (-1.5%). By Stephen Letts It may be baby steps, but it seems the US Senate may be heading towards breaking the deadlock that has shut down federal agencies for the past 40 days. Reuters is reporting that the Senate moved towards a vote on reopening the federal government. Here's what's just popped up on the wires: Senators plan to vote on advancing a House-passed stopgap funding bill as early as Sunday evening (Monday morning AEDT), with the understanding that it would be amended to combine a short-term funding measure with a package of three full-year appropriations bills, said Senate Majority Leader John Thune. The amended package would still have to be passed by the House of Representatives and sent to US President Donald Trump for his signature, a process that could take several days. Senate Democrats so far have resisted efforts to pass a funding measure, aiming to pressure Republicans to agree to healthcare fixes that would include extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Under the deal being discussed, the Senate would agree to hold a separate vote later on the subsidies. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, told reporters that he would vote against the funding measure but suggested there could be enough Democratic support to pass it. \"I am unwilling to accept a vague promise of a vote at some indeterminate time, on some undefined measure that extends the healthcare tax credits,\" Mr Blumenthal said. Sunday marked the 40th day of the shutdown, which has sidelined federal workers and affected food aid, parks and travel, while air-traffic control staffing shortages threaten to derail travel during the busy Thanksgiving holiday season later this month. Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, said the mounting effects of the shutdown have pushed the chamber towards an agreement. He said the final piece, a new resolution that would fund government operations into late January, would also reverse at least some of the Trump administration's mass layoffs of federal workers. \"Temperatures cool, the atmospheric pressure increases outside and all of a sudden it looks like things will come together,\" Mr Tillis told reporters. Should the government remain closed for much longer, economic growth could turn negative in the fourth quarter, especially if air travel does not return to normal levels by Thanksgiving, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett warned on the CBS's Face the Nation show. Thanksgiving falls on November 27 this year. Reuters By Stephen Letts The first takes on ANZ's full-year results are rolling in and it's fair to say they are not glowing. Brisbane-based broker Morgans described the result as \"messy\". J.P. Morgan's Andrew Triggs said the FY headline cash NPAT of $5.9 billion was 1% below his expectation and 4% down on the consensus figure reported by Bloomberg. He said the miss reflected higher costs. J.P. Morgan's key positives from the ANZ results: J.P. Morgan's key negatives from the ANZ results: By Stephen Letts Investors appear to have welcomed ANZ's 14% slide in cash profit, with the bank's share price opening 0.5% higher (10:20am AEDT), a result that is outperforming its big bank peers. In a mixed session so far, Westpac is marginally higher (+0.1%), NAB marginally lower (-0.1%) and CBA is down 0.4%.",

    "text": "Fans are convinced the Bayou Barbie just gave away her biggest off-court secret Angel Reese knows exactly how to keep fans guessing - and talking. Even though she's made it clear she wants to keep her love life private and far from the spotlight, the Chicago Sky star isn't exactly hiding her feelings either. From subtle hints to not-so-subtle Easter eggs, Reese has been dropping clues all over social media about who might have captured her heart. For months, rumors have swirled that Reese is dating an NBA player, and she's done little to shut them down. Between her podcast Unapologetically Angel, where she's hinted that she won't post her boyfriend online until she gets married, and her playful comments about her \"type\" being NBA players, fans have had plenty to analyze. Then came the TikTok that set the internet on fire. Reese casually mentioned that she calls Orlando home during the offseason instead of Chicago, where she plays during the WNBA season. Naturally, that sparked curiosity. In her latest TikTok, Reese appeared in the perfect game-day outfit for the Orlando Magic, and fans immediately began connecting the dots. The theory? Wendell Carter Jr. - and the evidence keeps stacking up. Back in July 2025, Carter was spotted wearing a shirt with Angel's face on it during the WNBA All-Star Game, and later joked that a 2-on-2 team featuring him and Reese could easily beat power couple Bam Adebayo and A'ja Wilson. Coincidence? The internet says no. Reese may be doing her best to keep her relationship under wraps, but the clues are adding up fast. From her Orlando home base to that Magic-themed TikTok, fans are convinced this love story is already written - and she's just letting us enjoy the slow reveal.",

    "title": "College football rankings REVEALED: Huge shake-up as Texas returns to top 10 and BYU tumbles",
    "text": "Texas returned to the top 10 of The Associated Press college football poll on Sunday, after a wild weekend saw 19 of the top 25 positions change hands. The Longhorns, the preseason No. 1 team, are ranked No. 10 in advance of its visit to No. 5 Georgia this week. They had been in the top 10 for the first six polls before their loss at Florida knocked them out of the Top 25 for a week. Four straight wins elevated them to No. 13 last week, and they jumped three spots ahead of BYU and Virginia and an idle Oklahoma, which they beat 23-6 on Oct. 11. Texas did not play over the weekend. The Atlantic Coast Conference, meanwhile, has five teams ranked for the first time this season, and two Group of Five conferences are now represented in the Top 25 a month before the playoff bracket is set. Ohio State was No. 1 for the 11th week in a row with 55 first-place votes. Indiana remained No. 2 after its narrow escape at Penn State, but the Hoosiers' six first-place votes were five fewer than last week. No. 3 Texas A&M got four first-place votes, three more than a week ago, and was 31 points behind Indiana. Alabama and Georgia rounded out the top five. Mississippi, Oregon, Texas Tech, Notre Dame and Texas rounded out the top 10. Indiana's Omar Cooper produced a miraculous catch to secure victory over Penn State Texas Tech (whose fans are pictured) beat BYU in a huge top-15 match-up in Lubbock In all, 19 spots in the Top 25 have new teams. The ACC has five teams with one loss in conference play and two others with two losses. That's reflected in the closely bunched group of ACC teams in the poll - No. 14 Georgia Tech, No. 16 Miami, No. 19 Louisville, No. 20 Virginia and No. 23 Pittsburgh. The last time the ACC had as many ranked teams was Nov. 3, 2024. The race for the Group of Five's automatic bid in the College Football Playoff got more interesting with Memphis' loss to Tulane on Friday. The CFP committee did not have a G5 team in its top 25 but said Memphis was first in line. That will almost certainly change when the committee's next rankings come out Tuesday. No. 24 James Madison of the Sun Belt Conference made its first AP poll appearance since 2023. The Dukes are 8-1, their only loss to Louisville, and are the highest-ranked G5 team. No. 25 South Florida of the American Conference is right behind, and Tulane of the American received the most votes among the unranked.",

    "title": "Man City show their potential by capping big week with signature win over Liverpool",
    "text": "Mark Ogden debates Man City's title credentials after closing the gap on Arsenal to four points. (1:03) MANCHESTER, England -- Manchester City laid down a marker in the Premier League title race with an impressive 3-0 win over reigning champions Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Erling Haaland saw an early penalty saved before giving City a deserved lead midway through the first half with a well-taken header. Virgil van Dijk thought he'd equalized only for his header to be ruled out because Andrew Robertson was deemed to be offside in front of Gianluigi Donnarumma. City made the most of their first-half dominance when Nico González got it to 2-0 just before halftime with a shot from outside the penalty area that deflected in off Van Dijk, and Jérémy Doku rounded off his man-of-the-match performance with a spectacular goal in the second half. The result moves City up to second in the table as they closed the gap on leaders Arsenal to four points after Mikel Arteta's side had to settle for a draw against Sunderland on Saturday. -- Rob Dawson It has been hard to tell where City are at after a mixed start to the season, but this week has revealed that they're actually pretty good. Pep Guardiola's team have seen off AFC Bournemouth, Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool in the space of seven days. More than that, all three performances were relatively convincing. The first half against Liverpool was maybe their best 45 minutes of the season. It might have been their best 45 minutes since the 2023-24 season. Guardiola has been careful to play down expectations after a miserable campaign in 2024-25, but they're keeping up with the UEFA Champions League pacesetters at the top of the league phase table; sit second in the Premier League, four points behind leaders Arsenal; and have an EFL Cup quarterfinal to come against Brentford next month. It's a case of so far, so good. There's a long way to go this season -- something Guardiola pointed out himself at his news conference Friday. All City can do is put themselves in a position to challenge for trophies in the new year, and they're well on their way to doing that. Liverpool might not be at the level that saw them crowned champions six months ago, but it was still a statement win. -- Dawson Perhaps the most fitting encapsulation of Liverpool's tumultuous season so far was provided in the second half at the Etihad, when the home supporters turned their backs on the action and did the iconic \"Poznan\" celebration. For Arne Slot's side, the sight of its longstanding rival basking in such an emphatic win represents a new nadir in a campaign that has lurched from the sublime to the ridiculous. After a promising week in which the Reds beat both Aston Villa and Real Madrid, Sunday's clash against a resurgent City simply proved a bridge too far. Ultimately, this was a game lost in the first half, with Liverpool unable to replicate the quality and intensity that helped them see off Madrid so impressively in midweek. Slot might well point to the fact that fortune did not favor his side; City's early penalty (which was well saved by Giorgi Mamardashvili) seemed like a harsh decision, while Van Dijk's controversial disallowed goal -- which would have made it 1-1 in the first half -- undoubtedly swung the momentum in City's favor. Still, the fact of the matter is that Liverpool have not been good enough this season. After 11 league games, they have already suffered five defeats -- more than they did in the entire last term -- and have now lost every game in which they have conceded the first goal. Defeat to City leaves Liverpool four points behind Guardiola's side and eight behind leaders Arsenal. If the Reds cannot find a way to recover the mentality that helped them romp to the title last season, they might quickly find that their two biggest rivals are completely out of sight. -- Beth Lindop What a performance from the Man City winger. He caused chaos down City's left all afternoon and capped off a wonderful display with a fantastic goal. Conor Bradley looked comfortable against Vinícius Júnior on Tuesday, but he couldn't handle Doku. The Belgium international won the early penalty that was missed by Haaland, and every time he got the ball, there was a feeling inside the stadium that something was about to happen. At one point in the first half, he was having so much success against Bradley that Slot ordered Ryan Gravenberch to double up. Nothing Liverpool tried seemed to work, and it was only when Doku was substituted at 73 minutes that the torment stopped. His goal, cutting in from the left and curling a right-footed shot into the far corner, was so good that when it was replayed on the big screens there were oohs and aahs from the City fans. Doku has shown flashes of his ability since arriving from Stade Rennais in 2023. This season, though, he's doing it consistently. His ability in one-on-one situations is so good that when he's playing like this, he's almost unstoppable. -- Dawson As Liverpool closed in on their mightily impressive victory over Real Madrid on Tuesday, Bradley's name boomed around the stadium. The home supporters inside Anfield were keen to serenade the right back after he had delivered arguably the most impressive display of his career, defending superbly to keep the tricky Vinícius at bay. Unfortunately for Liverpool, Bradley could not match that level of performance against City and was part of a defense that struggled to contain the outstanding Doku, particularly in the first half. Alongside him, Ibrahima Konaté also endured a tough afternoon and was outjumped by Haaland for the hosts' opener, while Robertson was replaced by Milos Kerkez early in the second half. After keeping back-to-back clean sheets against Villa and Madrid, this was a reminder that Liverpool still have work to do defensively if they hope to salvage anything from this season. The return of goalkeeper Alisson Becker after the international break should help breed confidence among the back line, but the Reds' leaky defense looks like it could very well be their undoing this term. -- Lindop Missing an early penalty in a big game might have had a negative impact on a lot of strikers. Not Haaland. He saw his ninth-minute spot kick saved by Mamardashvili, but it didn't stop the Norway international from making his mark. Matheus Nunes was clever in delaying his cross from the right just enough so that Robertson turned his back. The ball into the box was quality. After that, though, it was all about Haaland. He peeled off toward the back post and rose above Konaté to head the ball back across the goal and into the corner. In many ways, it was a typical Haaland goal. He wasn't the star against Liverpool, but he still got his 19th goal of the season and his 14th in 11 Premier League games. The 25-year-old has also moved to 99 Premier League goals in just 108 appearances. Those are scarcely believable numbers. Alan Shearer, the top goal scorer in Premier League history, needed 124 games to reach 100 goals. With Haaland in form like this, it's highly unlikely he'll need another 16 games to reach the 100 club. Another record is about to go. -- Dawson If it was against City at the Etihad last season that Mohamed Salah enjoyed one of his finest outings in a Liverpool shirt, then it was on the same turf this term that the forward's recent decline was laid bare. In February, the Egypt international scored Liverpool's opener and assisted Dominik Szoboszlai for their second en route to a victory that saw them make a giant stride toward the title. On Sunday, however, Salah toiled up against the prodigious Nico O'Reilly as Liverpool slumped to yet another miserable defeat. To the 33-year-old's credit, he battled until the end, even after spurning a great opportunity late in the second half. But, despite having scored in both of Liverpool's past two league games (against Brentford and Aston Villa), he looked like a shadow of his former self against City, failing to hit the target with any of his three shots. Salah has shown enough in recent outings to suggest Father Time has not caught up with him just yet, but his latest showing proves his days as Liverpool's main man might just be behind him. -- Lindop",
