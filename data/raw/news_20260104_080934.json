    "description": "Q: My husband and I have a great life in many ways. We are successful, have small children, and are doing well in life. My issue is that our sex life has really dwindled into an occasional treat, and I really miss it. It could be once a month now, although earlier this year it was a good three or four months where nothing happened. He says there’s no issue, and that we have just been busy. I will admit we are very busy, and often there’s no energy left to do anything other than veg on the couch before going to bed. I don’t have any worries that he will cheat or anything like that as everything else is so good between us. I just want us to go back to having the good times that we used to have. Intimacy is very important to me, and if I’m being really honest, I do feel really hurt that it has dropped off. It’s never been this long before in our relationship, and we haven’t been arguing or distant otherwise. How do I get things back on track between us?",
