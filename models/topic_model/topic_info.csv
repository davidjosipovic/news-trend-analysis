The ministers said the visit constituted a breach of established principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, reaffirming their unwavering support for the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia.

Al Muraikhi reiterated the State of Qatar\'s vehement condemnation of Israel\'s recognition of the ""Somaliland"" region of the Federal Republic of Somalia as an independent state.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format.

On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming.

Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz both pitched for the Cleveland Guardians. They have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July while Major League Baseball investigated what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when they pitched.

When we did see glimpses of the color, it was tweaked in new ways. Only Murders in the Building star Selena Gomez stepped onto the red carpet wearing a deep matte burgundy lip, courtesy of makeup artist Hung Vanngo, who intentionally stayed away from brighter red hues. “We wanted to lean into classic Old Hollywood and translate the film noir aesthetic onto the red carpet—the deep, dark tones you see in those old Hollywood movies—almost black in tone,” he tells Bazaar. “Since you see so much bright red on the carpet, this approach felt richer and more evocative of that classic cinematic mood.” Vanngo says he used the Creamy Matte Lipstick in New York Red from his eponymous line—a deep red lipstick with blue undertones.
