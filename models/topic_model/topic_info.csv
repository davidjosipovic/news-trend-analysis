However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format. Pricing and availability are unknown for now; the full description provided by Samsung and CES is as follows: The Samsung OLED (S95H) is the world\'s most advanced 48"" OLED TV for high-end gaming.

Osaka raised eyebrows when she entered the court for her first-round match against Antonia Ruzic sporting a unique pre-match look. She wore an ocean blue tie-dye tracksuit jacket and white wide-leg bottoms for the coin toss, along with a white umbrella. The jellyfish-inspired look was curated by fashion designer Robert Wun, who has previously worked on pieces worn by the likes of Beyonce, Cardi B and Ariana Grande. It came from a vision Osaka had while she was reading to her two-year-old daughter, Shai. Not everybody loved the outfit, though, with Jamie Murray and Eliza Wastcoat among those who weren\'t impressed. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Murray said: ""I felt there was an element of disrespect to the sport of tennis,"" while Wastcoat added: ""It looked a bit cheap, a little bit tacky.""

Sabalenka served four aces in the final game of the first set alone and overall put 82.7% of her first serves in play. The match, which was Sabalenka’s 500th at the WTA level, lasted 70 minutes. “I was focused, I was calm and it felt like everything was in control,” Sabalenka said. On Saturday, Sabalenka was presented with a trophy for finishing the year at No. 1. “I’m super happy and super proud of the work that has been done and that things are working and I’m getting better and better every day,” she said. “And I just hope that we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and hopefully we can stay there.” The season-ending tournament for the year’s top eight players starts with two four-woman groups of round-robin play. The top two finishers in each group advance to the semifinals. “I take this tournament as a regular tournament that I have to win five matches if I want to win the title,” Sabalenka said. “So I’m just trying to bring my best tennis and fight for every point.”', 'Retiring Wawrinka winds back the clock with gutsy win Stan Wawrinka\'s farewell tour has started with a gutsy win, the three-time grand slam champion beating world No.29 Arthur Rinderknech in a three-set thriller at the United Cup.

One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice.

Christian Williams, of Golygfa Mynydd, Mynydd Isa, appeared before Judge Simon Mills for sentencing at Mold Crown Court on Thursday (December 10) after admitting one count of theft and three counts of fraud by false representation. Williams, 53, had initially entered a not-guilty plea in December 2024 before changing his plea in July. Prosecutor Lee Reynolds said Williams, who ran a construction business, took large deposits from four sets of customers despite being in no financial position to carry out the work. The court heard that Mr John Hoyle agreed a £65,000 extension in March 2021 and paid a £13,000 deposit. Work was repeatedly delayed, and by March 2022 the project was still far from complete. Williams falsely told Mr Hoyle that bifold doors would arrive within four weeks and requested further payment, but the funds were never used to buy them. In texts to Mr Hoyle, Williams said he was “a mess”, had “lost money on the job”, and admitted he had not paid plasterers or plumbers.
