We all live in a 55+ community and have moved here from different areas of the country. We are a group of women who get together on a regular basis for outings. Over the past couple of months, I feel somewhat left out because of a couple of events I wasn’t included in. But what I’m trying to understand is why does she not “like” or comment on any of my Facebook posts when she’s all over everyone else’s with supportive and loving comments? Again, this is so silly, but I can’t help wondering why. When I look back at my posts, I noticed she has never acknowledged any of them, even for my birthday. We are still friends, we work with the same fundraising group, have dinner at each other’s house and get invited to the same events. This Facebook thing has got me confused and I don’t know what kind of friend she is so I’m getting uncomfortable around her. So now, what am I doing? Ignoring her posts, which makes me feel so stupid and juvenile. If I wasn’t part of this group, which I really like, I wouldn’t bother with her. Can you shed any light on her mindset?

We did a special trip for his older brother when he turned 40 and would like to do something special for this son’s 40th as well. Our daughter-in-law has made special plans for him and we are not included. I understand that, but I need some ideas as to how to celebrate this extra special year without rocking the boat. I love my son with all my heart, as I do all my children, and want his 40th birthday to be memorable in a positive way. Any suggestions? – Mom Who Wants to Celebrate Dear Mom: The issues your son and your husband are having may be an obstacle, but they aren’t insurmountable. And the thing that can get them on the path to resolution is the same thing that can get you answers about how to celebrate your son: open communication. It’s not within your purview to try to fix things between them, but you have your own relationship with your son and so I’d encourage you to reach out and tell him what you told me: you want to celebrate him, you know things are difficult, and you’re lookin', 'Asking Eric: After 6 years sober, man is frustrated by his family’s hold on their hurt and distrust Dear Eric: I’ve just turned 40 this past year.

Understandable. I’ve cleaned up and got my act together six years ago. At first, I tried to force my way back into their lives, which all refuted. I lashed out, said horrible things and stopped trying to be in their lives. My mom will stop by on my birthday for 10 minutes or so and drop a card off at Christmas.

Their “lovely” garden in Grantham featured on the show as Alan and his co-stars Katie Rushworth, David Domoney and Frances Tophill tried to transform it into something inspired by The Secret Garden. Initially, the space featured a large lawn area with a shed and concrete paving stones, surrounded by lush trees and greenery. Afterwards, it was transformed into a floral haven complete with a faux-ruined stone wall, stone paving stones leading in paths around the flowers, and wooden trellises around the side of the house.

During Saturday (November 22) night\'s show, the remaining contestants took to the dance floor at the iconic Blackpool Tower Ballroom. Before things kicked off for Blackpool Week, presenter Tess Daly informed viewers that the drag queen – real name Chris Dennis – would not be returning to the competition after sustaining a foot injury. She said: ""We can confirm she has very sadly had to withdraw from the competition,"" before revealing there would be no elimination this weekend. But this has left fans wondering why Sunday night\'s show is still airing now that there is no dance-off. Taking to social media with their queries, one wrote: ""So what’s the point of Sunday’s show when everything can be done tonight #Strictly?""

This year's CES is indisputably the Micro RGB show. Virtually every major TV manufacturer is incorporating the tri-colored pixel technology, as if the transparent TVs from last year are no longer cutting-edge. TCL has other plans. Also: CES 2026 news: Live updates on TVs, smart glasses, robots, and more we've seen so far The brand's new crown jewel TV of 2026 is the X11L, which features TCL's Super Quantum Dot (SQD) Mini LED panel, for which the company claims achieves 100 percent of the BT2020 color gamut. This is accomplished by pairing the SQD layer with a CSOT UltraColor Filter, as well as an Advanced Color Purity Algorithm. If that assembly of tech jargon doesn't tell you it's CES (or that TCL means business), then I don't know what will. Effectively, the X11L solves a major pain point with conventional Micro RGB TVs: color blooming, or color crosstalk. With Micro RGB TVs often emitting very bright light, certain colors can bleed into surrounding dark areas, reducing color accuracy. With the CSOT UltraColor Filter, TCL has significantly reduced these artifacts, rendering images that, to my fresh-off-a-plane eyes, appeared c"", 'Samsung OLED 48S95H: New 48-inch and 165 Hz OLED TV revealed ahead of schedule with HDR10 Plus Advanced support Samsung has already teased plenty of devices on the eve of CES 2026. However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format. Pricing and availability are unknown for now; the full description provided by Samsung and CES is as follows: The Samsung OLED (S95H) is the world\'s most advanced 48"" OLED TV for high-end gaming.

According to a Videocardz report, the OLED TV in question is the LG G6 Evo AI, a new RGB Tandem WOLED. The G6 will feature a new “Hyper Radiant OLED” panel with “Brightness Booster Ultra,” which provides up to 3.9x the brightness of a regular OLED TV. Now, the report also mentions “B6” as a reference point. Given that LG’s B-series OLED TVs (non-MLA, non-Evo) typically have a peak brightness of around 800 to 850 nits, a 3.9x increase over that would put the peak brightness of the upcoming LG G6 Evo AI between 3,120 and 3,315 nits. In addition to the increase in peak brightness, the G6 will also feature an improved anti-reflection layer, which could enhance viewing angles and reduce glare from bright ceiling lights, for an uninterrupted viewing experience. The same report claims that LG’s G6 OLED TV will be available across a variety of screen sizes, including 48, 55, 65, 77, 83, and 97 inches.
