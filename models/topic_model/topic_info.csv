They always had a place of honor on our family Christmas table. When she was no longer able, she gave me the cookie cutter, and my daughters and I took over the family tradition. It takes the three of us several days to make, bake, decorate, package and mail cookies to family members around the country. We enjoy doing it and feel like we’re continuing the fun and festive tradition. However, in recent years, not all of the recipients acknowledge receipt. At some point in their lives, they have all helped Grandma decorate, so they know the time involved. Because of past delivery issues, I track the boxes and inquire if I haven’t heard from them in a couple of days. Last year, one response was “yes we got them.” This feels unappreciative! In the past most would text a picture of their children with the cookies, which we really enjoyed. We rarely see any of them anymore, as they are busy raising their families and don’t live nearby.

We did a special trip for his older brother when he turned 40 and would like to do something special for this son’s 40th as well. Our daughter-in-law has made special plans for him and we are not included. I understand that, but I need some ideas as to how to celebrate this extra special year without rocking the boat.

And the thing that can get them on the path to resolution is the same thing that can get you answers about how to celebrate your son: open communication. It’s not within your purview to try to fix things between them, but you have your own relationship with your son and so I’d encourage you to reach out and tell him what you told me: you want to celebrate him, you know things are difficult, and you’re lookin', 'Asking Eric: After 6 years sober, man is frustrated by his family’s hold on their hurt and distrust Dear Eric: I’ve just turned 40 this past year. The last 15 years I was in a horrible drug addiction. I lied and hurt and did terrible things to a lot of people, especially my family. About eight years ago they officially disowned me. Understandable. I’ve cleaned up and got my act together six years ago. At first, I tried to force my way back into their lives, which all refuted. I lashed out, said horrible things and stopped trying to be in their lives. My mom will stop by on my birthday for 10 minutes or so and drop a card off at Christmas.

Time is running out, and I couldn’t imagine living my life without some kind of acceptance from my father. Or knowing he did or does love me.

To find a better way to reproduce this cool color, a team at Cornell University looked to nature. Specifically, a bird called the magnificent riflebird.

Their “lovely” garden in Grantham featured on the show as Alan and his co-stars Katie Rushworth, David Domoney and Frances Tophill tried to transform it into something inspired by The Secret Garden. Initially, the space featured a large lawn area with a shed and concrete paving stones, surrounded by lush trees and greenery. Afterwards, it was transformed into a floral haven complete with a faux-ruined stone wall, stone paving stones leading in paths around the flowers, and wooden trellises around the side of the house.

During Saturday (November 22) night\'s show, the remaining contestants took to the dance floor at the iconic Blackpool Tower Ballroom. Before things kicked off for Blackpool Week, presenter Tess Daly informed viewers that the drag queen – real name Chris Dennis – would not be returning to the competition after sustaining a foot injury. She said: ""We can confirm she has very sadly had to withdraw from the competition,"" before revealing there would be no elimination this weekend. But this has left fans wondering why Sunday night\'s show is still airing now that there is no dance-off. Taking to social media with their queries, one wrote: ""So what’s the point of Sunday’s show when everything can be done tonight #Strictly?""

The 62-year-old actress had triggered concerns about a potential exit after her daughter disclosed a rib injury on social media, stating that her mother had endured the discomfort to participate in Saturday\'s programme. The Doctor Who legend, who has been dazzling audiences on the dance floor alongside partner Johannes Radebe, was swift to comfort her supporters that injuries were simply ""part and parcel"" of the Strictly experience, and she had absolutely no plans to retire her dancing shoes. Fleur East, host of Strictly spin-off It Takes Two, has now verified that Alex will return to the competition following last week\'s Blackpool special. Discussing their forthcoming performance, Fleur disclosed: ""Alex and Johannes will be dancing a cha-cha-cha to Ring My Bell by Anita Ward.""
