This uniquely dark color is not easy to produce and may appear less black when it is viewed at an angle.

Vladimir Putin plunged millions of Ukrainians into cold and darkness amid Russian fury over a US and British operation to seize the Marinera oil tanker in the North Atlantic. Attacks on power plants left the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions almost completely without electricity, cutting heating supplies in the punishing cold winter. This came after Russia\'s humiliation from the American seizure of a shadow fleet ship despite Putin\'s warnings to the US to leave it alone. As the Kremlin dictator retreated out of sight, his frothing war fanatics demanded retaliation - including a nuclear response - which could put the globe on a trajectory to World War Three. Russian lawmaker Alexei Zhuravlev told Putin to ""attack with torpedoes"" after the US-British operation and ""sink a couple of American Coast Guard boats"". He raged that ""this is nothing less than outright piracy – the seizure of a civilian vessel by the armed forces of the American navy.

Never before had Ukraine faced such a large number of ballistic missiles in a single attack. The Russians targeted state-owned and private power plants, high-voltage substations belonging to Ukrenergo, Ukraine\'s state-owned electricity transmission operator, and oil and gas industry facilities. The most devastating losses were suffered by Centrenergo, a major state-owned energy company, which lost all its generating capacity. Both of its thermal power plants – Trypillia in Kyiv Oblast and Zmiivska in Kharkiv Oblast – have been completely shut down. ""It\'s been less than a month since the previous strike, and last night the enemy hit all our generating capacity. The plants are on fire. We have stopped. Energy generation is now at zero,"" Centrenergo said. Strikes on substations near nuclear power plants are particularly alarming. The latest attack damaged facilities near the Khmelnytskyi and Rivne nuclear power plants. The following morning, the consequences of the large-scale attack were being felt across the country: electricity shortages, emergency power cuts and', ""Bulgaria names manager to take over Russia's Lukoil refinery after US sanctions A parliamentary vote authorised the government to seize Lukoil's assets in the country Bulgaria on Friday nominated a senior government official to take control of a major Lukoil refinery in the east of the country following US sanctions against the Russian oil giant.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format. Pricing and availability are unknown for now; the full description provided by Samsung and CES is as follows: The Samsung OLED (S95H) is the world\'s most advanced 48"" OLED TV for high-end gaming.

The comments at the press conference confirmed once again that the ECB has no intention to leave its ‘good place’ any time soon. We had feared a rather uneventful press conference. What should we say? We hate to be right… Anyhow, here are a few interesting remarks made by Lagarde: On the ECB’s risk assessment, the introductory statement had the most remarkable change compared with September. Last month, the ECB had still talked about risks to the growth outlook that had become “more balanced”; today, it refrained from qualifying any balance of risk. Instead, the central bank had a somewhat more extensive list of upside and downside risks to the growth outlook. Lagarde even said that some of the downside risks had abated.

Belarus-born Tatiana Woollaston, 38, will be one of the officials on duty at the first Triple Crown event of the season, which begins on Saturday. Another Woollaston will also be involved at the York Barbican, her husband Ben, who booked his place in the 32-player showpiece by coming through qualifying earlier this week. He is now looking forward to a first-round clash with three-time UK champion John Higgins on Saturday night. However, there is no chance of Tatiana taking charge of the match. She told the Mirror ahead of last year's UK Championship that they try to keep their respective snooker careers as separate as possible.

During Saturday (November 22) night\'s show, the remaining contestants took to the dance floor at the iconic Blackpool Tower Ballroom. Before things kicked off for Blackpool Week, presenter Tess Daly informed viewers that the drag queen – real name Chris Dennis – would not be returning to the competition after sustaining a foot injury. She said: ""We can confirm she has very sadly had to withdraw from the competition,"" before revealing there would be no elimination this weekend. But this has left fans wondering why Sunday night\'s show is still airing now that there is no dance-off. Taking to social media with their queries, one wrote: ""So what’s the point of Sunday’s show when everything can be done tonight #Strictly?""

That indicates the CAA Sports client and the club have agreed to a minor league deal. Schunk, 28, changes organizations for the first time in his career. He was drafted by the Rockies in 2019, selected in the second round, and has been with that club a few weeks ago. With Colorado, he got into 55 big league games over the past two seasons. He stepped to the plate 131 times but struck out in 31.3% of those plate appearances and only drew a walk 3.1% of the time as he put up a tepid .222/.246/.302 line. His minor league offense has been better but not outstanding. In 1,170 Triple-A plate appearances, he has a .291/.348/.468 line. That looks good at first blush all those trips to the plate took place in the hitter-friendly Pacific Coast League, where that kind of production translates to an 89 wRC+. That indicates he was actually 11% worse than league average. The Rockies outrighted him off the roster in October and he elected free agency. Defensively, his reputation is pretty strong.

Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz both pitched for the Cleveland Guardians.

Thursday night’s crowning of Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees as this year’s National League and American League most valuable players offered a reminder of its rarity. One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice. He was a unanimous choice by Baseball Writers’ Association of America voters. Ohtani’s achievements remain impossible to overstate.']"

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming. While the King’s actions have been praised, some believe the monarch, 76, took too long to take action, especially over evicting the former prince from his Crown Estate mansion, however Queen Elizabeth's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson has now explained why.
