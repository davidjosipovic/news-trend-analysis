Their “lovely” garden in Grantham featured on the show as Alan and his co-stars Katie Rushworth, David Domoney and Frances Tophill tried to transform it into something inspired by The Secret Garden. Initially, the space featured a large lawn area with a shed and concrete paving stones, surrounded by lush trees and greenery. Afterwards, it was transformed into a floral haven complete with a faux-ruined stone wall, stone paving stones leading in paths around the flowers, and wooden trellises around the side of the house.

Australia head coach Andrew McDonald said in mid-January Hazlewood was on track to be fit for the squad’s World Cup opener against Ireland on February 11, but Cummins’s update was less optimistic. “I caught up with Joshy a few days ago, and he’s working so hard.

In a statement on Saturday, Tinubu said Nigeria remains a democracy anchored on constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion and belief. “Nigeria stands firmly as a democracy governed by constitutional guarantees of religious liberty,” the president said. “The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.” Trump had on Friday announced via his Truth Social platform that Nigeria had been redesignated on the US religious freedom watchlist as a “country of particular concern”.

Okai, a chieftain of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), stated this following a closed-door strategic meeting with Atiku, where discussions centred on the urgent need to build a united and formidable opposition capable of challenging the ruling party. The youth leader described the move to form a broad opposition coalition under the ADC platform as timely, especially in view of the prolonged leadership and structural crises rocking the PDP. According to him, Atiku’s intervention has prevented many political actors from becoming politically stranded as a result of the turmoil within their former party.

Addressing MPs, Ms Reeves said: ""The broken welfare system that we inherited wrote off millions of people as too sick to work and we will reform that system so that it is a system that does not count the cost of failure, but one that protects people who cannot work and empowers those who can. ""We have brought back face-to-face assessments for disability benefits. Those are the face-to-face assessments that the shadow chancellor (Sir Mel Stride) got rid of when he was work and pensions secretary and our changes we have made to Universal Credit will get 15,000 people back into work, a figure con']"

Speaking in an interview with the media, Madam Yang outlined how Zonda Tec Ghana has evolved into a major force in the country’s heavy-duty automobile and equipment industry. Under her leadership, the company she said has expanded its footprint across Ghana and the West African sub-region, supplying heavy-duty trucks, construction equipment, and comprehensive technical support services. But beyond market expansion, Madam Yang stressed that Zonda Tec’s mission is rooted in human development. “Our greatest achievement is not measured in the number of trucks we sell, but in the number of Ghanaian youths we empower to build and maintain those trucks,” she said. Over the years, the company has invested heavily in training academies and technical programmes, creating opportunities for artisans, technicians, and engineers to gain industry-relevant skills. Many of these trainees have secured employment in the competitive automobile and machinery sector, a development Madam Yan', 'Vocational education key to unlocking Nigeria’s demographic dividends Nigeria is one of the youngest countries in the world, with over 70 percent of its population under the age of 25. This presents a powerful demographic dividend that could drive innovation, productivity, and economic growth for decades. Yet without urgent and meaningful reforms in the education sector, this opportunity risks becoming a missed advantage. Fixing Nigeria’s education system is not just a policy priority; it is the foundation for unlocking the potential of an entire generation. Experts maintain that beyond the federal government’s policy rhetoric, there are urgent need to amplify vocational and technical education in the country. The pivotal roles of vocational and technical education in tackling unemployment, they say, cannot be overemphasised. Vocational education has been an integral part of development strategies in many developed countries because of its impact on productivity and economic growth. Christopher Itua, head of industrial services and development at the Institute for Industrial Technology (IIT), said vocational skills will not only transform Nigeria’s economy but will also elevate families from poverty.

The West Sacramento Department of Parks and Recreation is showcasing art by local Black artists in its Gallery 1075 space through February. “Throughout the rest of the month people can come in anytime the community center is open … to just enjoy the pieces themselves,” gallery curator Evan Harté said. “The art reception [on Feb. 12] though is going to be extra special because we’re going to have the artists actually come out and talk with the community, get to know them and talk about their processes.” One of the artists featured is Sacramento-based Danitta Nelson, who works on her art in-between taking care of her children and working as a program manager at a mental health care facility. Nelson said she loves to do 3D art where she can attach things to her illustrations, especially hair. “My biological father was an artist and my sister was an artist, but they don’t do art anymore,” Nelson said.

The Chiefs climbed up to second with victory over Leicester but the hosts’ inability to find that valuable fourth try, and its accompanying bonus point, cost them ending the calendar year at the summit of the Prem table. It was not until Stephen Varney’s score in the 72nd minute that the Tigers – who now end the year outside the top four – were put to bed. The visitors to a sold-out Sandy Park attacked in a shaky, sketchy manner, but they managed to cling on until Varney’s score, having played 20 minutes of the second half with 14 players following consecutive yellow cards, and kept out Exeter time and again. The hosts had four try-scoring opportunities ruined – two of which actually got over the line – in the first half, and both Campbell Ridl and Will Goodrick-Clarke failed to ground the ball at the death for the bonus-point score. But the Chiefs were worthy if somewhat sloppy victors against a side which offered little cut and thrust. Greg Fisilau, on the other hand, offered plenty, and it was the No 8’s burst through the heart of the Leicester defence which set up Varney’s score.', 'One of the most exciting cross-code talents is ready to shine in green and gold One of the region\'s best dual-code prospects has received his biggest call-up yet.

The Coore Arms, a village pub in Scruton, North Yorkshire, closed last Friday. Its owners accused Labour of creating an “environment where survival is no longer possible”. During the pandemic, the pub served as a lifeline for vulnerable villagers by providing grocery deliveries to those forced to shield or self-isolate. It was recognised by the local district council and given a special award by the Campaign for Real Ale for its not-for-profit grocery collection service.

Regulators cited concentrations of iodine and selenium above the levels they expect in products intended for infants, prompting the public-health action. The recall is part of a larger pressure on Nestlé’s infant-formula business that has already been under scrutiny. When a regulatory agency identifies mineral concentrations outside its safety thresholds for baby foods, the immediate priority is removing affected lots from store shelves and advising caregivers not to use those products until their pediatrician or local health authority provides guidance. What this means for parents and caregivers: Why it matters Infant formulas are regulated tightly because infants have limited ability to process excess minerals and because composition can directly affect growth and development. A recall over iodine and selenium levels can reduce the available pool of specialized formulas while regulators and the company investigate the cause and scope. Until more information is released about specific batches and the root cause, caregivers', 'Abbott Laboratories announces $21 billion deal to buy Cologuard-maker Exact Sciences Abbott Laboratories in Abbott Park on June 25, 2018.
