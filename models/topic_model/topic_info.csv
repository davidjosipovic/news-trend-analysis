They always had a place of honor on our family Christmas table. When she was no longer able, she gave me the cookie cutter, and my daughters and I took over the family tradition. It takes the three of us several days to make, bake, decorate, package and mail cookies to family members around the country. We enjoy doing it and feel like we’re continuing the fun and festive tradition. However, in recent years, not all of the recipients acknowledge receipt. At some point in their lives, they have all helped Grandma decorate, so they know the time involved. Because of past delivery issues, I track the boxes and inquire if I haven’t heard from them in a couple of days. Last year, one response was “yes we got them.” This feels unappreciative! In the past most would text a picture of their children with the cookies, which we really enjoyed. We rarely see any of them anymore, as they are busy raising their families and don’t live nearby.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format.
