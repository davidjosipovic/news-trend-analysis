Hazlewood, arguably the squad’s most important bowler, has struggled with hamstring and Achilles injuries and missed the entire five-Test Ashes series against England. Australia head coach Andrew McDonald said in mid-January Hazlewood was on track to be fit for the squad’s World Cup opener against Ireland on February 11, but Cummins’s update was less optimistic. “I caught up with Joshy a few days ago, and he’s working so hard. I really feel for Joshy. He’s had a few setbacks. [He’s] one of the hardest trainers,” Cummins told Australian broadcaster Nine Network. “He’s doing everything he can. I don’t think he will be there for the start of the tournament, but he’s trying his best to be there about halfway through.” With Mitchell Starc having retired from the format and Cummins sidelined with back problems, Australia head into the February 7 to March 8 World Cup undermanned and in poor form after a 111-run humiliation by Pakistan, which completed a 3-0 series whitewash.

Odigie-Oyegun made the remarks on Monday in Benin City, Edo State, during a formal reception for members of the Obidient Movement who recently defected en masse to the ADC. The defection follows the recent alignment of former Labour Party presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi, with the ADC. Addressing the gathering, Odigie-Oyegun said the decision by the Obidient Movement to join the ADC reflects a growing commitment among Nigerians, especially young people, to pursue political change and national renewal. “The calibre and dedication of new members joining our party strengthens my belief that a new Nigeria is within reach,” he said. Recalling recent developments, he added: “A few days ago, I witnessed the entry of Dele Momodu, a prominent figure, into the party. Today, I see a large group of youths who are genuinely committed to nation-building.

In a statement on Saturday, Tinubu said Nigeria remains a democracy anchored on constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion and belief. “Nigeria stands firmly as a democracy governed by constitutional guarantees of religious liberty,” the president said. “The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.” Trump had on Friday announced via his Truth Social platform that Nigeria had been redesignated on the US religious freedom watchlist as a “country of particular concern”. The move follows growing criticism by some US lawmakers, American evangelical groups and lobbyists who allege persecution of Christians in parts of Nigeria. However, Tinubu described those claims as inaccurate and unhelpful, adding that his administration has maintained open and active engagement with leaders of both major religions sin', 'ADC Coalition: Atiku Saved Many Political Actors From Becoming Politically Stranded – Okai Prominent youth advocate and political figure, Comrade Usman Okai Austin, has identified former Vice President and 2023 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, as a major driving force behind efforts to restore Nigeria’s democratic direction ahead of the 2027 general elections. Okai, a chieftain of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), stated this following a closed-door strategic meeting with Atiku, where discussions centred on the urgent need to build a united and formidable opposition capable of challenging the ruling party. The youth leader described the move to form a broad opposition coalition under the ADC platform as timely, especially in view of the prolonged leadership and structural crises rocking the PDP. According to him, Atiku’s intervention has prevented many political actors from becoming politically stranded as a result of the turmoil within their former party. He said, “Today, we are no longer at the mercy of those bent on destroying the PDP from within, because a stronger coalition has emerged due to Atiku’s foresight.” Okai argued that without the ADC-driven alliance, opposition voices would have been largely silenced in Ni']"

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format. Pricing and availability are unknown for now; the full description provided by Samsung and CES is as follows: The Samsung OLED (S95H) is the world\'s most advanced 48"" OLED TV for high-end gaming.

These screens can be useful for productivity on business trips or while traveling. But portable monitors that combine a high resolution with a fast refresh rate remain uncommon in the mid-range segment. Luckfox wants to address this gap with its new 16"" 4K Touch Monitor. The 16-inch display features a 3840 × 2400 (WQUXGA) IPS panel with 350 nits brightness and a 1200:1 contrast ratio. It uses optical bonding technology with 6H-hardness toughened glass and a matte finish to minimize ambient reflections. The 16:10 aspect ratio provides more vertical workspace than the standard 16:9 format. It also supports a 120Hz refresh rate, which is an upgrade over the common 60Hz panels found in many portable monitors, such as the Auzai ME16Z01 or the Arzopa A1M; response times aren\'t disclosed, though.

On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming. While the King’s actions have been praised, some believe the monarch, 76, took too long to take action, especially over evicting the former prince from his Crown Estate mansion, however Queen Elizabeth's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson has now explained why.

He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history.

Regulators cited concentrations of iodine and selenium above the levels they expect in products intended for infants, prompting the public-health action. The recall is part of a larger pressure on Nestlé’s infant-formula business that has already been under scrutiny. When a regulatory agency identifies mineral concentrations outside its safety thresholds for baby foods, the immediate priority is removing affected lots from store shelves and advising caregivers not to use those products until their pediatrician or local health authority provides guidance. What this means for parents and caregivers: Why it matters Infant formulas are regulated tightly because infants have limited ability to process excess minerals and because composition can directly affect growth and development. A recall over iodine and selenium levels can reduce the available pool of specialized formulas while regulators and the company investigate the cause and scope. Until more information is released about specific batches and the root cause, caregivers', 'Abbott Laboratories announces $21 billion deal to buy Cologuard-maker Exact Sciences Abbott Laboratories in Abbott Park on June 25, 2018.
