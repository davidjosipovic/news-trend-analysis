Gilbert Arenas has been one of the strongest believers in the Los Angeles Lakers\' potential. Even when the team has appeared lackluster and repeatedly fallen short of expectations, Gil finds optimism in the little things. However, with the team emerging as the lone top-six seed in either conference to register a negative points differential, the extent of their defensive woes has been such that even Gil was forced to admit the Lakers need a trade to get better. Ultimately, that reality forced ""Agent Zero"" to admit and explain how the Lakers might need to trade their most up-and-coming, valuable asset, Austin Reaves, to jump into legitimate title contention.

Sabalenka served four aces in the final game of the first set alone and overall put 82.7% of her first serves in play.

On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming.

Gov. Eleni Kounalakis spoke out against federal efforts to expand offshore oil drilling, state lawmakers told The Center Square that increased drilling is deeply unpopular among coastal residents. Opponents warn against the environmental costs. But supporters say technology has made drilling safer. They also note offshore drilling could boost America's energy independence and lower gas prices in California, which typically has the highest in the U.S. Legislators’ comments opposing the drilling come after the announcement in November 2025 that the U.S. Department of the Interior would expand oil and gas drilling leases not just off the Pacific Coast in areas such as Santa Barbara, but other sites on the nation’s outer continental shelf. “We have a deep, visceral experience that is seared into the community’s consciousness about the risks of offshore oil development,” Assemblymember Gregg Hart, D-Santa Barbara, told The Center Square. “We are adamantly opposed to the leasing.

Yet the competition doesn't always go according to plan, with the BBC ballroom series having witnessed numerous surprising outcomes throughout its history. The 2009 series delivered one of the programme's most unexpected moments when Chris Hollins defied the odds to triumph over favourite Ricky Whittle. The victory surprised many, with the presenter later admitting he felt somewhat guilty about his win too. Hollyoaks actor Ricky, partnered with professional dancer Natalie Lowe, had regularly out-danced Chris, who performed alongside Ola Jordan. Nevertheless, Chris garnered substantial support from the viewing public and whilst he wasn't receiving the highest judges' scores, he consistently progressed through public votes, never facing elimination in the dance-off. Ultimately, he claimed victory, reports Wales Online. Prior to the finale, Chris acknowledged feeling a little guilty about reaching the last stage instead of Ali Bastian and Brian Fortuna, who had achieved better scor"", 'Strictly Come Dancing fans have same complaint as La Voix withdraws from show \'Pointless!\' Strictly Come Dancing fans have been left with the same question after it was announced La Voix has withdrawn from the competition. During Saturday (November 22) night\'s show, the remaining contestants took to the dance floor at the iconic Blackpool Tower Ballroom. Before things kicked off for Blackpool Week, presenter Tess Daly informed viewers that the drag queen – real name Chris Dennis – would not be returning to the competition after sustaining a foot injury. She said: ""We can confirm she has very sadly had to withdraw from the competition,"" before revealing there would be no elimination this weekend. But this has left fans wondering why Sunday night\'s show is still airing now that there is no dance-off. Taking to social media with their queries, one wrote: ""So what’s the point of Sunday’s show when everything can be done tonight #Strictly?""

Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz both pitched for the Cleveland Guardians. They have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July while Major League Baseball investigated what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when they pitched.

It’s very early into the offseason, but we do know the Yankees have roster holes to fill with nine free agents counting Cody Bellinger, who has already opted out of his deal. The Bombers need a center fielder with Trent Grisham and Bellinger on the market. Will they make sure one of them returns? Will they lose both, choose not to spend aggressively and raise the curtain on prospect Spencer Jones after a 35-homer, 25-steal season in the minors? The Yankees also need relievers.

Thursday night’s crowning of Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees as this year’s National League and American League most valuable players offered a reminder of its rarity. One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice. He was a unanimous choice by Baseball Writers’ Association of America voters. Ohtani’s achievements remain impossible to overstate.']"
