Earlier this week, I sold my entire stake in FTSE 250 retailer WH Smith (LSE:SMWH). The stock jumped 11% on Monday (19 January) but I took that as my cue to head for the exit. A new leader might be about to set the company on a more promising path. But my investment thesis has fundamentally changed and I now think there are better opportunities elsewhere at the moment. I bought WH Smith shares because I thought they were cheaper than they looked. Specifically, I had the view that the stock market was underestimating the value of its travel business. With £189m in annual trading profits and sales growing at 10%, I thought a market value of £1.4bn was a bargain. But not everything was quite what it seemed. Unfortunately, the company wasn’t as profitable as it looked.

They always had a place of honor on our family Christmas table. When she was no longer able, she gave me the cookie cutter, and my daughters and I took over the family tradition. It takes the three of us several days to make, bake, decorate, package and mail cookies to family members around the country. We enjoy doing it and feel like we’re continuing the fun and festive tradition. However, in recent years, not all of the recipients acknowledge receipt. At some point in their lives, they have all helped Grandma decorate, so they know the time involved. Because of past delivery issues, I track the boxes and inquire if I haven’t heard from them in a couple of days. Last year, one response was “yes we got them.” This feels unappreciative!

Okai, a chieftain of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), stated this following a closed-door strategic meeting with Atiku, where discussions centred on the urgent need to build a united and formidable opposition capable of challenging the ruling party.

According to him, Atiku’s intervention has prevented many political actors from becoming politically stranded as a result of the turmoil within their former party.

The escape room begins with a familiar challenge: how to avoid getting a phone call from the lab about a rejected sample. From there, nurses progress through a series of puzzles based on real‐world scenarios, selecting properly filled blood culture bottles; answering type & screen questions; identifying best practices to prevent clotted or hemolyzed samples; ordering laboratory tubes correctly, and collecting laboratory tubes in the correct order of draw. Each correct answer provides a key or code to unlock the next stage, ultimately leading to a prize.

Sabalenka served four aces in the final game of the first set alone and overall put 82.7% of her first serves in play. The match, which was Sabalenka’s 500th at the WTA level, lasted 70 minutes. “I was focused, I was calm and it felt like everything was in control,” Sabalenka said. On Saturday, Sabalenka was presented with a trophy for finishing the year at No. 1. “I’m super happy and super proud of the work that has been done and that things are working and I’m getting better and better every day,” she said. “And I just hope that we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and hopefully we can stay there.” The season-ending tournament for the year’s top eight players starts with two four-woman groups of round-robin play.

She wore an ocean blue tie-dye tracksuit jacket and white wide-leg bottoms for the coin toss, along with a white umbrella.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format.

He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history.
