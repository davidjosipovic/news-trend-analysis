Earlier this week, I sold my entire stake in FTSE 250 retailer WH Smith (LSE:SMWH). The stock jumped 11% on Monday (19 January) but I took that as my cue to head for the exit. A new leader might be about to set the company on a more promising path. But my investment thesis has fundamentally changed and I now think there are better opportunities elsewhere at the moment. I bought WH Smith shares because I thought they were cheaper than they looked. Specifically, I had the view that the stock market was underestimating the value of its travel business. With £189m in annual trading profits and sales growing at 10%, I thought a market value of £1.4bn was a bargain. But not everything was quite what it seemed. Unfortunately, the company wasn’t as profitable as it looked. An accounting irregularity meant it had significantly overstated the profits in its North American business at £54m, rather than £34', 'Will the Nvidia share price crash in 2026?

Despite a very solid 2025, the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) share price has just come off its highs. And some investors are worrying that a full-blown crash might be on the cards for 2026? I think a number of the risks might be less significant than some investors seem to believe. But there are definitely some threats and challenges it’s getting very hard to ignore. One big question with Nvidia is how long can it maintain its extraordinarily impressive revenue growth? After all, sales have more than doubled in 2025 after increasing 125% in 2024. With the stock trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 23, there’s clearly future growth priced in. But another 100% increase would require $130bn in additional revenues. That’s a lot, but it’s important to keep this in context. Even if Nvidia does double its sales again in 2026, its revenues will still be below what Microsoft managed in 2025.

Understandable. I’ve cleaned up and got my act together six years ago. At first, I tried to force my way back into their lives, which all refuted. I lashed out, said horrible things and stopped trying to be in their lives. My mom will stop by on my birthday for 10 minutes or so and drop a card off at Christmas.

Growth is fueled by urban migration, rising demand for quick-shopping experiences, and the integration of digital ordering, loyalty programs, and payment systems. Retailers are expanding prepared-food offerings, adding EV charging stations, and using real-time analytics to speed up restocking, boosting basket value even as fuel sales fluctuate. Active private-equity deals and M&A continue due to steady cash flows and consistent customer traffic, while regulatory incentives for alternative-energy solutions offer new revenue opportunities.

England last won the tournament in 2020, and their most recent Grand Slam was in 2016, both under Eddie Jones, but they go into their opening match at home to Wales on February 7 with more confidence that they can top the standings than for many years. After narrowly losing their championship opener to Ireland in Dublin almost a year ago, England have chalked up 11 successive wins, including a rare one against New Zealand, and coach Steve Borthwick has built considerable depth in his squad. “We welcome the expectation because it’s a compliment for what we’ve done and what we’ve achieved over a short period of time, but it also keeps us on our toes because we know we can’t be complacent and can’t rely on previous performances,” George said at the Six Nations launch in Edinburgh on Monday.

On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming. While the King’s actions have been praised, some believe the monarch, 76, took too long to take action, especially over evicting the former prince from his Crown Estate mansion, however Queen Elizabeth's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson has now explained why.

Sabalenka served four aces in the final game of the first set alone and overall put 82.7% of her first serves in play. The match, which was Sabalenka’s 500th at the WTA level, lasted 70 minutes. “I was focused, I was calm and it felt like everything was in control,” Sabalenka said. On Saturday, Sabalenka was presented with a trophy for finishing the year at No. 1. “I’m super happy and super proud of the work that has been done and that things are working and I’m getting better and better every day,” she said. “And I just hope that we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and hopefully we can stay there.” The season-ending tournament for the year’s top eight players starts with two four-woman groups of round-robin play. The top two finishers in each group advance to the semifinals. “I take this tournament as a regular tournament that I have to win five matches if I want to win the title,” Sabalenka said. “So I’m just trying to bring my best tennis and fight for every point.”', 'Retiring Wawrinka winds back the clock with gutsy win Stan Wawrinka\'s farewell tour has started with a gutsy win, the three-time grand slam champion beating world No.29 Arthur Rinderknech in a three-set thriller at the United Cup.

Thursday night’s crowning of Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees as this year’s National League and American League most valuable players offered a reminder of its rarity. One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format.
