He contends that critical delays in the Feed Ghana program are depriving farmers and the national economy of promised benefits. Ahiagbah argued the initiative, designed to enhance food security and provide farmer support, has failed to show meaningful progress. He expressed particular concern over the absence of promised buffer stock systems and market access for local producers. These shortcomings especially impact local rice farmers grappling with post harvest losses, he noted. The situation reportedly undermines confidence in the administration’s flagship strategy and hinders the sector’s potential for job creation and expanded production. Ahiagbah challenged the government to reaffirm its commitment to import substitution. He specifically urged authorities to bolster domestic capacity for rice production. “It would be a feather in the president’s cap to promote our local capacity,” Ahiagbah stated, advocating for political will to support Ghanaian growers over import cartels. He further emphasized that locally produced rice offers superior nutritional value', 'ADC-Obidient alliance can end APC dominance in 2027 – Odigie-Oyegun Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and a prominent leader of the African Democratic Congress, ADC, has expressed confidence that the growing collaboration between the ADC and the Obidient Movement could dislodge the APC from power in the 2027 general elections. Odigie-Oyegun made the remarks on Monday in Benin City, Edo State, during a formal reception for members of the Obidient Movement who recently defected en masse to the ADC. The defection follows the recent alignment of former Labour Party presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi, with the ADC. Addressing the gathering, Odigie-Oyegun said the decision by the Obidient Movement to join the ADC reflects a growing commitment among Nigerians, especially young people, to pursue political change and national renewal. “The calibre and dedication of new members joining our party strengthens my belief that a new Nigeria is within reach,” he said.

Okai, a chieftain of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), stated this following a closed-door strategic meeting with Atiku, where discussions centred on the urgent need to build a united and formidable opposition capable of challenging the ruling party. The youth leader described the move to form a broad opposition coalition under the ADC platform as timely, especially in view of the prolonged leadership and structural crises rocking the PDP. According to him, Atiku’s intervention has prevented many political actors from becoming politically stranded as a result of the turmoil within their former party.

Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz both pitched for the Cleveland Guardians.

One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice. He was a unanimous choice by Baseball Writers’ Association of America voters. Ohtani’s achievements remain impossible to overstate.']"

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format.

Trump says controlling the mineral-rich Danish territory is crucial for US national security given increased Russian and Chinese military activity in the Arctic. ""If we don\'t take Greenland, Russia or China will, and I\'m not letting that happen,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, despite neither country laying claim to the vast island.

In a Truth Social post, Trump criticized Denmark for its inability to address security concerns surrounding Greenland despite repeated NATO warnings. ""NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that \'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.\' Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it,"" he wrote. ""Now it is time, and it will be done!!!"" President Trump added. Set The Express as a \'Preferred Source\' to get quicker access to the news you value.
