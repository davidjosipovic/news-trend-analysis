The rules are pretty simple: Visit one or more of the county’s 6,000-plus small retail businesses, take a selfie at the store and submit the entry to the county. A random drawing of selfies submitted online, in person or by mail determines the winner of the three prizes: $1,000, $500, or $250. Every entry must include a photo of the person inside or outside a local small business. The contest gets underway on Saturday, Nov. 1 and continues through Nov. 30. This year’s contest was launched in downtown Pontiac at Designed Mindfully, an interior-design company. Designed Mindfully was among the 2024’s top vote getters, with HobbyTown and AM2PM Barbershop in Southfield; It’s the Little Things in Ortonville; and Vibrant Vizionz in Oak Park. Designed Mindfully owner Deya Marchand said her shop is more than a small store. “We are a space where community, creativity, and intentional living come together,” she said, adding that Local Gems aligns beautifully with her store’s mission “to live and shop with purpose, supporting other small businesses and local artists.” The n', 'Residents mull new fire district in canyon LENORE — Volunteer firefighters are kicking around the idea of starting a new rural fire district to cover an area north of the Clearwater River from east of Arrow Junction to just west of Lenore.

At some point in their lives, they have all helped Grandma decorate, so they know the time involved.

Odigie-Oyegun made the remarks on Monday in Benin City, Edo State, during a formal reception for members of the Obidient Movement who recently defected en masse to the ADC. The defection follows the recent alignment of former Labour Party presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi, with the ADC. Addressing the gathering, Odigie-Oyegun said the decision by the Obidient Movement to join the ADC reflects a growing commitment among Nigerians, especially young people, to pursue political change and national renewal. “The calibre and dedication of new members joining our party strengthens my belief that a new Nigeria is within reach,” he said. Recalling recent developments, he added: “A few days ago, I witnessed the entry of Dele Momodu, a prominent figure, into the party.

The youth leader described the move to form a broad opposition coalition under the ADC platform as timely, especially in view of the prolonged leadership and structural crises rocking the PDP. According to him, Atiku’s intervention has prevented many political actors from becoming politically stranded as a result of the turmoil within their former party. He said, “Today, we are no longer at the mercy of those bent on destroying the PDP from within, because a stronger coalition has emerged due to Atiku’s foresight.” Okai argued that without the ADC-driven alliance, opposition voices would have been largely silenced in Ni']"

Sen. Ben Adams, R-Nampa, presented his proposal Wednesday following a public outreach campaign to gauge Idahoans’ concerns on the issue of public lands and receive feedback on the language within his amendment. With adjustments now implemented, Adams said the original intent remains: ensuring public lands continue to belong to Idahoans. “I wanted feedback,” Adams said. “I wanted a lot of feedback because it dealt with, and deals with, a very personal matter for every Idahoan, and that is our public land here in Idaho.” In order to have an amendment added to the Idaho State Constitution, it would require an affirmative vote from two-thirds of both the Idaho House of Representatives and the Idaho Senate.

Under her leadership, the company she said has expanded its footprint across Ghana and the West African sub-region, supplying heavy-duty trucks, construction equipment, and comprehensive technical support services. But beyond market expansion, Madam Yang stressed that Zonda Tec’s mission is rooted in human development. “Our greatest achievement is not measured in the number of trucks we sell, but in the number of Ghanaian youths we empower to build and maintain those trucks,” she said. Over the years, the company has invested heavily in training academies and technical programmes, creating opportunities for artisans, technicians, and engineers to gain industry-relevant skills.

He expressed particular concern over the absence of promised buffer stock systems and market access for local producers. These shortcomings especially impact local rice farmers grappling with post harvest losses, he noted. The situation reportedly undermines confidence in the administration’s flagship strategy and hinders the sector’s potential for job creation and expanded production. Ahiagbah challenged the government to reaffirm its commitment to import substitution. He specifically urged authorities to bolster domestic capacity for rice production. “It would be a feather in the president’s cap to promote our local capacity,” Ahiagbah stated, advocating for political will to support Ghanaian growers over import cartels.

Osaka raised eyebrows when she entered the court for her first-round match against Antonia Ruzic sporting a unique pre-match look. She wore an ocean blue tie-dye tracksuit jacket and white wide-leg bottoms for the coin toss, along with a white umbrella. The jellyfish-inspired look was curated by fashion designer Robert Wun, who has previously worked on pieces worn by the likes of Beyonce, Cardi B and Ariana Grande. It came from a vision Osaka had while she was reading to her two-year-old daughter, Shai. Not everybody loved the outfit, though, with Jamie Murray and Eliza Wastcoat among those who weren\'t impressed. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Murray said: ""I felt there was an element of disrespect to the sport of tennis,"" while Wastcoat added: ""It looked a bit cheap, a little bit tacky."" It came after Wastcoat lasted Osaka\'s attire in a video on her Instagram account, saying: ""You are simply lying to yourself if you say you like Naomi Osaka\'s walk on outfit. ""You know what?

Sabalenka served four aces in the final game of the first set alone and overall put 82.7% of her first serves in play. The match, which was Sabalenka’s 500th at the WTA level, lasted 70 minutes. “I was focused, I was calm and it felt like everything was in control,” Sabalenka said. On Saturday, Sabalenka was presented with a trophy for finishing the year at No. 1. “I’m super happy and super proud of the work that has been done and that things are working and I’m getting better and better every day,” she said. “And I just hope that we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and hopefully we can stay there.” The season-ending tournament for the year’s top eight players starts with two four-woman groups of round-robin play. The top two finishers in each group advance to the semifinals. “I take this tournament as a regular tournament that I have to win five matches if I want to win the title,” Sabalenka said. “So I’m just trying to bring my best tennis and fight for every point.”']"

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format. Pricing and availability are unknown for now; the full description provided by Samsung and CES is as follows: The Samsung OLED (S95H) is the world\'s most advanced 48"" OLED TV for high-end gaming.

Also: CES 2026 news: Live updates on TVs, smart glasses, robots, and more we've seen so far The brand's new crown jewel TV of 2026 is the X11L, which features TCL's Super Quantum Dot (SQD) Mini LED panel, for which the company claims achieves 100 percent of the BT2020 color gamut. This is accomplished by pairing the SQD layer with a CSOT UltraColor Filter, as well as an Advanced Color Purity Algorithm. If that assembly of tech jargon doesn't tell you it's CES (or that TCL means business), then I don't know what will. Effectively, the X11L solves a major pain point with conventional Micro RGB TVs: color blooming, or color crosstalk.
