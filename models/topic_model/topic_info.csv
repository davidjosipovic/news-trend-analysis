I don’t think he will be there for the start of the tournament, but he’s trying his best to be there about halfway through.” With Mitchell Starc having retired from the format and Cummins sidelined with back problems, Australia head into the February 7 to March 8 World Cup undermanned and in poor form after a 111-run humiliation by Pakistan, which completed a 3-0 series whitewash.

This uniquely dark color is not easy to produce and may appear less black when it is viewed at an angle.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format.

On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming.

Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz both pitched for the Cleveland Guardians. They have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July while Major League Baseball investigated what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when they pitched.

First up are the GM meetings, which will be held in Las Vegas next week. It’s very early into the offseason, but we do know the Yankees have roster holes to fill with nine free agents counting Cody Bellinger, who has already opted out of his deal. The Bombers need a center fielder with Trent Grisham and Bellinger on the market. Will they make sure one of them returns? Will they lose both, choose not to spend aggressively and raise the curtain on prospect Spencer Jones after a 35-homer, 25-steal season in the minors? The Yankees also need relievers. Devin Williams and Luke Weaver, both free agents, have one foot out the door. Bench players are on the shopping list, too. What should the Yankees do? This is the subject of the latest Yankees roundtable with beat writer Randy Miller and baseball columnist Bob Klapisch: Klapisch: This is the time of the year that I’m convinced fans love most.

Thursday night’s crowning of Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees as this year’s National League and American League most valuable players offered a reminder of its rarity. One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice. He was a unanimous choice by Baseball Writers’ Association of America voters. Ohtani’s achievements remain impossible to overstate.']"
