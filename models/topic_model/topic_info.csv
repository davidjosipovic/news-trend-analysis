They always had a place of honor on our family Christmas table. When she was no longer able, she gave me the cookie cutter, and my daughters and I took over the family tradition. It takes the three of us several days to make, bake, decorate, package and mail cookies to family members around the country. We enjoy doing it and feel like we’re continuing the fun and festive tradition. However, in recent years, not all of the recipients acknowledge receipt. At some point in their lives, they have all helped Grandma decorate, so they know the time involved. Because of past delivery issues, I track the boxes and inquire if I haven’t heard from them in a couple of days. Last year, one response was “yes we got them.” This feels unappreciative! In the past most would text a picture of their children with the cookies, which we really enjoyed. We rarely see any of them anymore, as they are busy raising their families and don’t live nearby. This seems like a way for us to continue somewhat of a co', 'Asking Eric: Can mom work through tension in son’s relationship with dad so they can celebrate special birthday? Dear Eric: My son is turning 40 on December 22. My husband and I are at a quandary as to how to celebrate him. There have been issues between my husband and him over things from his childhood. We did a special trip for his older brother when he turned 40 and would like to do something special for this son’s 40th as well. Our daughter-in-law has made special plans for him and we are not included. I understand that, but I need some ideas as to how to celebrate this extra special year without rocking the boat. I love my son with all my heart, as I do all my children, and want his 40th birthday to be memorable in a positive way. Any suggestions? – Mom Who Wants to Celebrate Dear Mom: The issues your son and your husband are having may be an obstacle, but they aren’t insurmountable. And the thing that can get them on the path to resolution is the same thing that can get you answers about how to celebrate your son: open communication. It’s not within your purview to try to fix things between them, but you have your own relationship with your son and so I’d encourage you to reach out and tell him what you told me: you want to celebrate him, you know things are difficult, and you’re lookin', 'Asking Eric: After 6 years sober, man is frustrated by his family’s hold on their hurt and distrust Dear Eric: I’ve just turned 40 this past year. The last 15 years I was in a horrible drug addiction. I lied and hurt and did terrible things to a lot of people, especially my family. About eight years ago they officially disowned me. Understandable. I’ve cleaned up and got my act together six years ago. At first, I tried to force my way back into their lives, which all refuted. I lashed out, said horrible things and stopped trying to be in their lives. My mom will stop by on my birthday for 10 minutes or so and drop a card off at Christmas. As for my two older brothers and my father, it’s radio silence. I guess what I’m asking is, what do I do to fix this and fast, as I said I’ve turned 40 this year, my parents are both 70. Time is running out, and I couldn’t imagine living my life without some kind of acceptance from my father. Or knowing he did or does love me. My heart breaks at the thought, but this is a real pickle. How can I fix a problem when the ones I need to fix it with won’t talk to me?

The 62-year-old actress had triggered concerns about a potential exit after her daughter disclosed a rib injury on social media, stating that her mother had endured the discomfort to participate in Saturday\'s programme. The Doctor Who legend, who has been dazzling audiences on the dance floor alongside partner Johannes Radebe, was swift to comfort her supporters that injuries were simply ""part and parcel"" of the Strictly experience, and she had absolutely no plans to retire her dancing shoes. Fleur East, host of Strictly spin-off It Takes Two, has now verified that Alex will return to the competition following last week\'s Blackpool special. Discussing their forthcoming performance, Fleur disclosed: ""Alex and Johannes will be dancing a cha-cha-cha to Ring My Bell by Anita Ward.""
