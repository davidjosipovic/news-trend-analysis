We all live in a 55+ community and have moved here from different areas of the country. We are a group of women who get together on a regular basis for outings. Over the past couple of months, I feel somewhat left out because of a couple of events I wasn’t included in. But what I’m trying to understand is why does she not “like” or comment on any of my Facebook posts when she’s all over everyone else’s with supportive and loving comments? Again, this is so silly, but I can’t help wondering why. When I look back at my posts, I noticed she has never acknowledged any of them, even for my birthday. We are still friends, we work with the same fundraising group, have dinner at each other’s house and get invited to the same events. This Facebook thing has got me confused and I don’t know what kind of friend she is so I’m getting uncomfortable around her. So now, what am I doing? Ignoring her posts, which makes me feel so stupid and juvenile. If I wasn’t part of this group, which I really like, I wouldn’t bother with her. Can you shed any light on her mindset?

Dear Eric: My son is turning 40 on December 22. My husband and I are at a quandary as to how to celebrate him. There have been issues between my husband and him over things from his childhood. We did a special trip for his older brother when he turned 40 and would like to do something special for this son’s 40th as well. Our daughter-in-law has made special plans for him and we are not included. I understand that, but I need some ideas as to how to celebrate this extra special year without rocking the boat. I love my son with all my heart, as I do all my children, and want his 40th birthday to be memorable in a positive way. Any suggestions? – Mom Who Wants to Celebrate Dear Mom: The issues your son and your husband are having may be an obstacle, but they aren’t insurmountable. And the thing that can get them on the path to resolution is the same thing that can get you answers about how to celebrate your son: open communication. It’s not within your purview to try to fix things between them, but you have your own relationship with your son and so I’d encourage you to reach out and tell him what you told me: you want to celebrate him, you know things are difficult, and you’re lookin', 'Asking Eric: After 6 years sober, man is frustrated by his family’s hold on their hurt and distrust Dear Eric: I’ve just turned 40 this past year. The last 15 years I was in a horrible drug addiction. I lied and hurt and did terrible things to a lot of people, especially my family. About eight years ago they officially disowned me. Understandable. I’ve cleaned up and got my act together six years ago. At first, I tried to force my way back into their lives, which all refuted. I lashed out, said horrible things and stopped trying to be in their lives. My mom will stop by on my birthday for 10 minutes or so and drop a card off at Christmas.

Yet the competition doesn't always go according to plan, with the BBC ballroom series having witnessed numerous surprising outcomes throughout its history. The 2009 series delivered one of the programme's most unexpected moments when Chris Hollins defied the odds to triumph over favourite Ricky Whittle. The victory surprised many, with the presenter later admitting he felt somewhat guilty about his win too. Hollyoaks actor Ricky, partnered with professional dancer Natalie Lowe, had regularly out-danced Chris, who performed alongside Ola Jordan. Nevertheless, Chris garnered substantial support from the viewing public and whilst he wasn't receiving the highest judges' scores, he consistently progressed through public votes, never facing elimination in the dance-off. Ultimately, he claimed victory, reports Wales Online. Prior to the finale, Chris acknowledged feeling a little guilty about reaching the last stage instead of Ali Bastian and Brian Fortuna, who had achieved better scor"", 'Strictly Come Dancing fans have same complaint as La Voix withdraws from show \'Pointless!\' Strictly Come Dancing fans have been left with the same question after it was announced La Voix has withdrawn from the competition.

In the aftermath of both Tate and Paul losing their respective boxing matches this weekend, fans have called for the pair to face off against each other in the ring for their next bout. Paul's fight with Anthony Joshua was overshadowed by a woman pushing away a man in the crowd following a lewd act. Tate, a controversial influencer, took to social media after losing to Chase DeMoor by decision on Saturday’s Misfits Boxing event in Dubai. “I’m not ready for Jake,” Tate posted on X. “Time is the fire in which we all burn. Fighting is for young men.” Tate, 39, seemingly wants no part of the 28-year-old YouTuber-turned-boxer, or any boxer for that matter, after he was roughed up by DeMoor in his Misfits debut on Saturday. A longtime professional kickboxer, Tate finally tried his luck in the boxing ring after months of anticipation since the bout was originally announced in October.

Sabalenka served four aces in the final game of the first set alone and overall put 82.7% of her first serves in play. The match, which was Sabalenka’s 500th at the WTA level, lasted 70 minutes. “I was focused, I was calm and it felt like everything was in control,” Sabalenka said. On Saturday, Sabalenka was presented with a trophy for finishing the year at No. 1. “I’m super happy and super proud of the work that has been done and that things are working and I’m getting better and better every day,” she said. “And I just hope that we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and hopefully we can stay there.” The season-ending tournament for the year’s top eight players starts with two four-woman groups of round-robin play.

Vladimir Putin plunged millions of Ukrainians into cold and darkness amid Russian fury over a US and British operation to seize the Marinera oil tanker in the North Atlantic. Attacks on power plants left the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions almost completely without electricity, cutting heating supplies in the punishing cold winter. This came after Russia\'s humiliation from the American seizure of a shadow fleet ship despite Putin\'s warnings to the US to leave it alone. As the Kremlin dictator retreated out of sight, his frothing war fanatics demanded retaliation - including a nuclear response - which could put the globe on a trajectory to World War Three. Russian lawmaker Alexei Zhuravlev told Putin to ""attack with torpedoes"" after the US-British operation and ""sink a couple of American Coast Guard boats"". He raged that ""this is nothing less than outright piracy – the seizure of a civilian vessel by the armed forces of the American navy.

Never before had Ukraine faced such a large number of ballistic missiles in a single attack. The Russians targeted state-owned and private power plants, high-voltage substations belonging to Ukrenergo, Ukraine\'s state-owned electricity transmission operator, and oil and gas industry facilities. The most devastating losses were suffered by Centrenergo, a major state-owned energy company, which lost all its generating capacity. Both of its thermal power plants – Trypillia in Kyiv Oblast and Zmiivska in Kharkiv Oblast – have been completely shut down. ""It\'s been less than a month since the previous strike, and last night the enemy hit all our generating capacity. The plants are on fire. We have stopped. Energy generation is now at zero,"" Centrenergo said. Strikes on substations near nuclear power plants are particularly alarming. The latest attack damaged facilities near the Khmelnytskyi and Rivne nuclear power plants. The following morning, the consequences of the large-scale attack were being felt across the country: electricity shortages, emergency power cuts and', ""Bulgaria names manager to take over Russia's Lukoil refinery after US sanctions A parliamentary vote authorised the government to seize Lukoil's assets in the country Bulgaria on Friday nominated a senior government official to take control of a major Lukoil refinery in the east of the country following US sanctions against the Russian oil giant.

On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming. While the King’s actions have been praised, some believe the monarch, 76, took too long to take action, especially over evicting the former prince from his Crown Estate mansion, however Queen Elizabeth's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson has now explained why.

Thursday night’s crowning of Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees as this year’s National League and American League most valuable players offered a reminder of its rarity. One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice.

(Ezra Shaw/Getty Images/TNS) President Donald Trump told the New York Post that music artist Bad Bunny was a “terrible choice” to headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show and that the NFL’s selection of the Puerto Rican singer and rapper sows “hatred.” Department of Homeland Security adviser Corey Lewandowski suggested that Bad Bunny loathes the U.S. “It’s so shameful that they’ve decided to pick somebody who just seems to hate America so much to represent them at the halftime game,” he told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said on Monday that Bad Bunny disseminates “anti-American propaganda.” The upshot: Bad Bunny (aka Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) is an enemy of the state. An outsider who doesn’t possess American values. A Super Bowl wrecker. Heated debate around who is worthy to perform the halftime show is an American tradition (Prince, yes. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, no).
