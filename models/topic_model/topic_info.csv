They always had a place of honor on our family Christmas table. When she was no longer able, she gave me the cookie cutter, and my daughters and I took over the family tradition. It takes the three of us several days to make, bake, decorate, package and mail cookies to family members around the country. We enjoy doing it and feel like we’re continuing the fun and festive tradition. However, in recent years, not all of the recipients acknowledge receipt. At some point in their lives, they have all helped Grandma decorate, so they know the time involved. Because of past delivery issues, I track the boxes and inquire if I haven’t heard from them in a couple of days. Last year, one response was “yes we got them.” This feels unappreciative!

The film, directed by Daniel Etim-Effiong, recently became available on Netflix. Its plot follows a couple whose wedding day in south-west Nigeria turns into a nightmare when their celebratory convoy is ambushed by gunmen disguised as cattle herders. The story quickly shifts from a joyous celebration to a brutal fight for survival. However, the movie’s central conflict has drawn significant criticism on the social media platform X. Prominent voices, including former presidential aide Bashir Ahmad, have condemned the film for what they call “a dangerous profiling of an ethnic group”. In a lengthy post, Ahmad argued that the scene depicting the attack “paints a picture that is dangerously inaccurate”. He expressed concern that the stereotyping fuels suspicion and violence against innocent Fulani people and could create an international stigma against the entire community. Ahmad concluded by calling on the Nigerian Film Corporation, led by Ali Nuhu, to investigate the film.

Odigie-Oyegun made the remarks on Monday in Benin City, Edo State, during a formal reception for members of the Obidient Movement who recently defected en masse to the ADC. The defection follows the recent alignment of former Labour Party presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi, with the ADC. Addressing the gathering, Odigie-Oyegun said the decision by the Obidient Movement to join the ADC reflects a growing commitment among Nigerians, especially young people, to pursue political change and national renewal. “The calibre and dedication of new members joining our party strengthens my belief that a new Nigeria is within reach,” he said.

Okai, a chieftain of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), stated this following a closed-door strategic meeting with Atiku, where discussions centred on the urgent need to build a united and formidable opposition capable of challenging the ruling party. The youth leader described the move to form a broad opposition coalition under the ADC platform as timely, especially in view of the prolonged leadership and structural crises rocking the PDP. According to him, Atiku’s intervention has prevented many political actors from becoming politically stranded as a result of the turmoil within their former party. He said, “Today, we are no longer at the mercy of those bent on destroying the PDP from within, because a stronger coalition has emerged due to Atiku’s foresight.” Okai argued that without the ADC-driven alliance, opposition voices would have been largely silenced in Ni']"

This uniquely dark color is not easy to produce and may appear less black when it is viewed at an angle. To find a better way to reproduce this cool color, a team at Cornell University looked to nature. Specifically, a bird called the magnificent riflebird. The result is the darkest known fabric ever created and it is detailed in a study recently published in the journal Nature Communications. The magnificent riflebird is a large songbird and member of the bird-of-paradise family found in New Guinea and Australia.

Also: CES 2026 news: Live updates on TVs, smart glasses, robots, and more we've seen so far The brand's new crown jewel TV of 2026 is the X11L, which features TCL's Super Quantum Dot (SQD) Mini LED panel, for which the company claims achieves 100 percent of the BT2020 color gamut. This is accomplished by pairing the SQD layer with a CSOT UltraColor Filter, as well as an Advanced Color Purity Algorithm. If that assembly of tech jargon doesn't tell you it's CES (or that TCL means business), then I don't know what will. Effectively, the X11L solves a major pain point with conventional Micro RGB TVs: color blooming, or color crosstalk. With Micro RGB TVs often emitting very bright light, certain colors can bleed into surrounding dark areas, reducing color accuracy. With the CSOT UltraColor Filter, TCL has significantly reduced these artifacts, rendering images that, to my fresh-off-a-plane eyes, appeared c"", 'Samsung OLED 48S95H: New 48-inch and 165 Hz OLED TV revealed ahead of schedule with HDR10 Plus Advanced support Samsung has already teased plenty of devices on the eve of CES 2026. However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format.

TPV Technology Group, the company behind GP TV, claims the screen targets premium users who value high-end visual fidelity, as well as the public sector and government institutions.

Thursday night’s crowning of Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees as this year’s National League and American League most valuable players offered a reminder of its rarity. One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice.

The Chiefs climbed up to second with victory over Leicester but the hosts’ inability to find that valuable fourth try, and its accompanying bonus point, cost them ending the calendar year at the summit of the Prem table. It was not until Stephen Varney’s score in the 72nd minute that the Tigers – who now end the year outside the top four – were put to bed. The visitors to a sold-out Sandy Park attacked in a shaky, sketchy manner, but they managed to cling on until Varney’s score, having played 20 minutes of the second half with 14 players following consecutive yellow cards, and kept out Exeter time and again. The hosts had four try-scoring opportunities ruined – two of which actually got over the line – in the first half, and both Campbell Ridl and Will Goodrick-Clarke failed to ground the ball at the death for the bonus-point score. But the Chiefs were worthy if somewhat sloppy victors against a side which offered little cut and thrust. Greg Fisilau, on the other hand, offered plenty, and it was the No 8’s burst through the heart of the Leicester defence which set up Varney’s score.', 'One of the most exciting cross-code talents is ready to shine in green and gold One of the region\'s best dual-code prospects has received his biggest call-up yet.
