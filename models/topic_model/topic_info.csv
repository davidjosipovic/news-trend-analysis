The Doctor Who legend, who has been dazzling audiences on the dance floor alongside partner Johannes Radebe, was swift to comfort her supporters that injuries were simply ""part and parcel"" of the Strictly experience, and she had absolutely no plans to retire her dancing shoes. Fleur East, host of Strictly spin-off It Takes Two, has now verified that Alex will return to the competition following last week\'s Blackpool special.

Australia head coach Andrew McDonald said in mid-January Hazlewood was on track to be fit for the squad’s World Cup opener against Ireland on February 11, but Cummins’s update was less optimistic. “I caught up with Joshy a few days ago, and he’s working so hard.

I don’t think he will be there for the start of the tournament, but he’s trying his best to be there about halfway through.” With Mitchell Starc having retired from the format and Cummins sidelined with back problems, Australia head into the February 7 to March 8 World Cup undermanned and in poor form after a 111-run humiliation by Pakistan, which completed a 3-0 series whitewash.

This uniquely dark color is not easy to produce and may appear less black when it is viewed at an angle. To find a better way to reproduce this cool color, a team at Cornell University looked to nature. Specifically, a bird called the magnificent riflebird. The result is the darkest known fabric ever created and it is detailed in a study recently published in the journal Nature Communications. The magnificent riflebird is a large songbird and member of the bird-of-paradise family found in New Guinea and Australia.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming. While the King’s actions have been praised, some believe the monarch, 76, took too long to take action, especially over evicting the former prince from his Crown Estate mansion, however Queen Elizabeth's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson has now explained why.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format.
