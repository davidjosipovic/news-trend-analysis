This is accomplished by pairing the SQD layer with a CSOT UltraColor Filter, as well as an Advanced Color Purity Algorithm. If that assembly of tech jargon doesn't tell you it's CES (or that TCL means business), then I don't know what will. Effectively, the X11L solves a major pain point with conventional Micro RGB TVs: color blooming, or color crosstalk.

Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz both pitched for the Cleveland Guardians.

The Bombers need a center fielder with Trent Grisham and Bellinger on the market. Will they make sure one of them returns? Will they lose both, choose not to spend aggressively and raise the curtain on prospect Spencer Jones after a 35-homer, 25-steal season in the minors? The Yankees also need relievers. Devin Williams and Luke Weaver, both free agents, have one foot out the door. Bench players are on the shopping list, too. What should the Yankees do?

Thursday night’s crowning of Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees as this year’s National League and American League most valuable players offered a reminder of its rarity. One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice. He was a unanimous choice by Baseball Writers’ Association of America voters. Ohtani’s achievements remain impossible to overstate.']"

The Prince, 41, reportedly was taking part in the polo tournament to stand in for a friend who couldn’t make it. He is believed to have been on the Aspen Valley team.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming. While the King’s actions have been praised, some believe the monarch, 76, took too long to take action, especially over evicting the former prince from his Crown Estate mansion, however Queen Elizabeth's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson has now explained why.
