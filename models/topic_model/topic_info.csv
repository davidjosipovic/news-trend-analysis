Dear Eric: My son is turning 40 on December 22. My husband and I are at a quandary as to how to celebrate him. There have been issues between my husband and him over things from his childhood. We did a special trip for his older brother when he turned 40 and would like to do something special for this son’s 40th as well. Our daughter-in-law has made special plans for him and we are not included. I understand that, but I need some ideas as to how to celebrate this extra special year without rocking the boat. I love my son with all my heart, as I do all my children, and want his 40th birthday to be memorable in a positive way. Any suggestions? – Mom Who Wants to Celebrate Dear Mom: The issues your son and your husband are having may be an obstacle, but they aren’t insurmountable. And the thing that can get them on the path to resolution is the same thing that can get you answers about how to celebrate your son: open communication. It’s not within your purview to try to fix things between them, but you have your own relationship with your son and so I’d encourage you to reach out and tell him what you told me: you want to celebrate him, you know things are difficult, and you’re lookin', 'Asking Eric: After 6 years sober, man is frustrated by his family’s hold on their hurt and distrust Dear Eric: I’ve just turned 40 this past year. The last 15 years I was in a horrible drug addiction. I lied and hurt and did terrible things to a lot of people, especially my family. About eight years ago they officially disowned me. Understandable. I’ve cleaned up and got my act together six years ago. At first, I tried to force my way back into their lives, which all refuted. I lashed out, said horrible things and stopped trying to be in their lives. My mom will stop by on my birthday for 10 minutes or so and drop a card off at Christmas. As for my two older brothers and my father, it’s radio silence. I guess what I’m asking is, what do I do to fix this and fast, as I said I’ve turned 40 this year, my parents are both 70. Time is running out, and I couldn’t imagine living my life without some kind of acceptance from my father. Or knowing he did or does love me. My heart breaks at the thought, but this is a real pickle. How can I fix a problem when the ones I need to fix it with won’t talk to me? Do I just keep ignoring their existence and put on this façade that I don’t care to my wife and 4-year-old son? What picture am I painting to my son, as he’s been guilty by association yo']"

England last won the tournament in 2020, and their most recent Grand Slam was in 2016, both under Eddie Jones, but they go into their opening match at home to Wales on February 7 with more confidence that they can top the standings than for many years. After narrowly losing their championship opener to Ireland in Dublin almost a year ago, England have chalked up 11 successive wins, including a rare one against New Zealand, and coach Steve Borthwick has built considerable depth in his squad. “We welcome the expectation because it’s a compliment for what we’ve done and what we’ve achieved over a short period of time, but it also keeps us on our toes because we know we can’t be complacent and can’t rely on previous performances,” George said at the Six Nations launch in Edinburgh on Monday.

After battling a persistent groin injury in recent weeks, the 18-year-old built on Sunday’s La Liga outing – when he netted his first league goal since August – with another vibrant performance in Belgium, helping Barça claw back three times to secure a point. Nicolo Tresoldi and Ferran Torres exchanged early goals before Carlos Forbs put Brugge back ahead just before halftime. Yamal struck back a minute past the hour mark, slotting home coolly after slicing through the defense with a brilliant solo run. “I’m happy that Lamine is back at this level, but we don’t know what will happen tomorrow or next Sunday,” the German coach said. “The important thing is that he manages his situation because it’s not easy. He has to be really focused on how he trains and also on the treatments. Hopefully the pain goes away.” Receiving a pass outside the penalty area, Yamal surged through two defenders, laid the ball off to Fermín López, and continued his run, collec', 'How to watch the live broadcast of the Saudi Arabia vs Jordan match?

The outlet mentions that the club is determined to avoid repeating situations like the one involving Kylian Mbappe earlier in the campaign, with all focus now shifting towards a single, overriding objective, which is the Champions League. The turning point came back in mid-December, when Real Madrid faced Talavera. Despite internal concerns surrounding Mbappe’s physical condition, the French forward not only featured in the match but also completed the full 90 minutes in a hard-fought 3–2 victory. At the time, the decision was seen as a calculated risk, but the consequences soon became clear. In the aftermath of that game, Mbappe was forced to miss two key fixtures. He was unavailable for a crucial La Liga clash against Real Betis, and also sat out the Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Atletico Madrid. Mbappe played against Talavera despite physical issues.

While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming.
