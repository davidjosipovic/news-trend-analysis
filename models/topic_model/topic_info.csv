They always had a place of honor on our family Christmas table. When she was no longer able, she gave me the cookie cutter, and my daughters and I took over the family tradition. It takes the three of us several days to make, bake, decorate, package and mail cookies to family members around the country. We enjoy doing it and feel like we’re continuing the fun and festive tradition. However, in recent years, not all of the recipients acknowledge receipt. At some point in their lives, they have all helped Grandma decorate, so they know the time involved. Because of past delivery issues, I track the boxes and inquire if I haven’t heard from them in a couple of days. Last year, one response was “yes we got them.” This feels unappreciative!

Buying food doesn\'t have to be expensive. In fact, there are plenty of online grocery stores now that offer affordable, healthy items that can be much cheaper than retail. One of these grocers is Martie, a discount retailer that sells overstock, surplus, and near-best-by goods.

On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming.

This year's CES is indisputably the Micro RGB show. Virtually every major TV manufacturer is incorporating the tri-colored pixel technology, as if the transparent TVs from last year are no longer cutting-edge. TCL has other plans. Also: CES 2026 news: Live updates on TVs, smart glasses, robots, and more we've seen so far The brand's new crown jewel TV of 2026 is the X11L, which features TCL's Super Quantum Dot (SQD) Mini LED panel, for which the company claims achieves 100 percent of the BT2020 color gamut. This is accomplished by pairing the SQD layer with a CSOT UltraColor Filter, as well as an Advanced Color Purity Algorithm. If that assembly of tech jargon doesn't tell you it's CES (or that TCL means business), then I don't know what will. Effectively, the X11L solves a major pain point with conventional Micro RGB TVs: color blooming, or color crosstalk. With Micro RGB TVs often emitting very bright light, certain colors can bleed into surrounding dark areas, reducing color accuracy. With the CSOT UltraColor Filter, TCL has significantly reduced these artifacts, rendering images that, to my fresh-off-a-plane eyes, appeared c"", 'Samsung OLED 48S95H: New 48-inch and 165 Hz OLED TV revealed ahead of schedule with HDR10 Plus Advanced support Samsung has already teased plenty of devices on the eve of CES 2026. However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format.

TPV Technology Group, the company behind GP TV, claims the screen targets premium users who value high-end visual fidelity, as well as the public sector and government institutions.

The stats come from the Communication Risk Information Centre (COMRiC), which represents local cell phone networks. Telecoms crime touches everything from banking and energy to personal security and national infrastructure, COMRiC says. Threats include SIM swap fraud, subscription and identity fraud, ransomware attacks, and infrastructure sabotage. COMRiC CEO Thokozani Mvelase says the various network operators have to spend a huge amount of money on security to prevent any ""catastrophic effect"" of cyber attacks. ""We had to put not only resources and investment into making sure there\'s a secured network, but remember that revenue and service disruptions can affect the customer as well because mobile devices themselves can be used to commit various types of fraud.""

The discovery, made by cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler, revealed approximately 96 GB of raw credential data that was entirely unprotected, allowing anyone with a standard web browser to access, search, and download the information. The sheer scale of the exposure touches almost every major corner of the digital economy. The database contained logins for 48 million Gmail accounts, 17 million Facebook accounts, 6.5 million Instagram credentials, and 3.4 million Netflix profiles. Crucially for the financial sector, the leak included over 420,000 logins for Binance, alongside countless other banking details, crypto wallets, and credit card credentials. Beyond consumer platforms, the cache even contained sensitive logins for .gov domains from multiple countries, posing a significant risk for national security and targeted spear-phishing campaigns. Security analysts believe the database was likely compiled using “infostealer"" malware. This type of malicious software silently infects devices via phi', ""T-Mobile adds harsh rule to flexible payment option for customers As a subscriber, you can share up to 3 articles each month with friends for free.
