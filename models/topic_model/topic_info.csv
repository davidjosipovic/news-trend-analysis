On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming. While the King’s actions have been praised, some believe the monarch, 76, took too long to take action, especially over evicting the former prince from his Crown Estate mansion, however Queen Elizabeth's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson has now explained why.

He was drafted by the Rockies in 2019, selected in the second round, and has been with that club a few weeks ago. With Colorado, he got into 55 big league games over the past two seasons. He stepped to the plate 131 times but struck out in 31.3% of those plate appearances and only drew a walk 3.1% of the time as he put up a tepid .222/.246/.302 line.

One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice.

""Ou', 'HNL Lab Medicine Brings Escape Room Fun to Hospital Education ALLENTOWN, Pa., Nov. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- HNL Lab Medicine is transforming hospital training by turning mandatory education into an adventure. To strengthen the collaboration between laboratory and nursing teams, HNL Lab Medicine\'s Clinical Hospital Advisors have introduced an innovative ""escape room""–style educational game that turns essential lab‐related lessons into an interactive experience. The escape room begins with a familiar challenge: how to avoid getting a phone call from the lab about a rejected sample. From there, nurses progress through a series of puzzles based on real‐world scenarios, selecting properly filled blood culture bottles; answering type & screen questions; identifying best practices to prevent clotted or hemolyzed samples; ordering laboratory tubes correctly, and collecting laboratory tubes in the correct order of draw. Each correct answer provides a key or code to unlock the next stage, ultimately leading to a prize. The activity takes less than ten minutes per nurse, no longer than a standard training session, but delivers far more excitement and engagement. The format encourages problem‐solving, sparks conversation, and helps key lessons stick. ""Ou']"

Tracy Fisher, president of the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association, says drugs for animals — from cats and dogs to sheep and cattle — are becoming increasingly unavailable. She says Canadian regulations discourage drug manufacturers from going through the process to get their medications approved for distribution, even though the medicines are available in other countries. Animal welfare issues arise when veterinarians have fewer drugs at their disposal, she adds. “If you have an animal suffering from a disease and you can’t treat it, but your colleagues across the border or everywhere else can, that’s incredibly frustrating,” Fisher said in a recent interview. A lack of medications can also affect the food system, she said. For example, a new drug to treat dairy cows may not be available in Canada, resulting in veterinarians using an older, less effective medication. “(The cow) may not be able to be part of the milk supply system during that time,” Fisher said. “Worst-case scenario, the farmer loses t', ""Expert reveals the five dog breeds to avoid - 1 is top family favourite Choosing the right dog breed can be both thrilling and overwhelming. With hundreds of options, each with its own temperament, activity level, grooming needs, and potential health issues, finding the perfect fit requires careful consideration. While some dogs thrive in homes with children or adapt easily to a calm lifestyle, others require constant exercise, mental stimulation, or may have costly medical concerns. The reality of dog ownership is often more complex than the adorable posts we see online. That's why consulting experienced professionals and doing thorough research is essential.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format. Pricing and availability are unknown for now; the full description provided by Samsung and CES is as follows: The Samsung OLED (S95H) is the world\'s most advanced 48"" OLED TV for high-end gaming.

This year's CES is indisputably the Micro RGB show. Virtually every major TV manufacturer is incorporating the tri-colored pixel technology, as if the transparent TVs from last year are no longer cutting-edge. TCL has other plans. Also: CES 2026 news: Live updates on TVs, smart glasses, robots, and more we've seen so far The brand's new crown jewel TV of 2026 is the X11L, which features TCL's Super Quantum Dot (SQD) Mini LED panel, for which the company claims achieves 100 percent of the BT2020 color gamut. This is accomplished by pairing the SQD layer with a CSOT UltraColor Filter, as well as an Advanced Color Purity Algorithm. If that assembly of tech jargon doesn't tell you it's CES (or that TCL means business), then I don't know what will. Effectively, the X11L solves a major pain point with conventional Micro RGB TVs: color blooming, or color crosstalk. With Micro RGB TVs often emitting very bright light, certain colors can bleed into surrounding dark areas, reducing color accuracy. With the CSOT UltraColor Filter, TCL has significantly reduced these artifacts, rendering images that, to my fresh-off-a-plane eyes, appeared c"", ""Our pick for the best budget TV just dropped to its lowest-ever price on Amazon The best TVs come in all shapes and sizes, and as a result, it can be difficult to know what to buy.
