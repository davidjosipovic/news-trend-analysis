Earlier this week, I sold my entire stake in FTSE 250 retailer WH Smith (LSE:SMWH). The stock jumped 11% on Monday (19 January) but I took that as my cue to head for the exit. A new leader might be about to set the company on a more promising path. But my investment thesis has fundamentally changed and I now think there are better opportunities elsewhere at the moment. I bought WH Smith shares because I thought they were cheaper than they looked. Specifically, I had the view that the stock market was underestimating the value of its travel business. With £189m in annual trading profits and sales growing at 10%, I thought a market value of £1.4bn was a bargain. But not everything was quite what it seemed. Unfortunately, the company wasn’t as profitable as it looked. An accounting irregularity meant it had significantly overstated the profits in its North American business at £54m, rather than £34', 'Why Greggs shares crashed 40% in 2025 Image source: Getty Images You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

The last year was one to forget for Greggs‘ (LSE:GRG) shareholders. But there are two big questions investors need to ask. One is whether the underlying business is 40% worse than it was a year ago. The other is whether the stock’s worth considering right now. At first sight, 2025 didn’t look like a bad year for Greggs the business. The firm had more stores and revenues climbed around 6.7% during the first nine months of the year. Under the surface though, there are two issues. The first is the majority of the sales growth had been driven by new store openings – without this, sales growth had been more like 2.2%. That’s below inflation. And this raises concerns about how long the company’s going to be able to keep generating sales growth by opening new stores. The second issue is that the firm’s operating income had actually fallen during this time as a result of higher costs weighing on margins', ""Where to invest $10,000 in ASX 200 shares this month Image source: Getty Images You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

AccuWeather's Geoff Cornish explains why. For big parts of the United States, the past few days have brought lots of snow and lots of cold. Where there's snow and cold, there are slips, falls and ice-related injuries. Ice forms along the shore of Lake Michigan on Jan. 23 in Chicago. A man digs out his car on Beacon Hill following a winter storm that dumped more than a foot of snow across the region Monday in Boston. A woman walks across the campus of the University of Mississippi Monday in Oxford, Miss., following a weekend ice storm. Freezing rain and sleet are responsible for some of the most dangerous driving conditions during the winter. AccuWeather's Anna Azallion offers the best safety tips if driving on ice is unavoidable.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format. Pricing and availability are unknown for now; the full description provided by Samsung and CES is as follows: The Samsung OLED (S95H) is the world\'s most advanced 48"" OLED TV for high-end gaming.

Also: CES 2026 news: Live updates on TVs, smart glasses, robots, and more we've seen so far The brand's new crown jewel TV of 2026 is the X11L, which features TCL's Super Quantum Dot (SQD) Mini LED panel, for which the company claims achieves 100 percent of the BT2020 color gamut. This is accomplished by pairing the SQD layer with a CSOT UltraColor Filter, as well as an Advanced Color Purity Algorithm. If that assembly of tech jargon doesn't tell you it's CES (or that TCL means business), then I don't know what will. Effectively, the X11L solves a major pain point with conventional Micro RGB TVs: color blooming, or color crosstalk. With Micro RGB TVs often emitting very bright light, certain colors can bleed into surrounding dark areas, reducing color accuracy.

While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles.

If you’re unfamiliar with the sport of curling, it’s fairly straightforward: two teams slide granite rocks from one end of a sheet of ice to the other, trying to get as many of their rocks closest to the centre of the rings on each end as possible. And true to its name, the rocks are rotated so they “curl” across the sheet and around other rocks. Curling is also one of Canada’s biggest sports. Canada is the world leader in curling gold medals and overall medals in the Olympics, and the vast majority of the world’s curlers are from Canada. Though curling might look like a simple game, there is a slew of science and engineering that goes into understanding how the sport works. Dr. Sean Maw (PhD), an associate professor with the University of Saskatchewan (USask) College of Engineering in the Ron and Jane Graham School of Professional Development and the Jerry G.

Avista said crews restored power to approximately 86% of its customers following Wednesday’s powerful windstorm. On the Palouse, there were just over 2,000 customers still affected by the outages, according to Avista’s outage map. In Nez Perce and Asotin counties, there were just over 500 customers affected. Avista says all available employees are working on restoring the power. Most outages are concentrated in northern Idaho, where some residents may experience outages until Sunday. Historically strong winds and moisture on the ground Wednesday caused trees and branches to fall, which damaged power lines across the Inland Northwest. One damaged power pole can take up to eight hours to replace, Avista says. In total, some 80,000 of Avista’s customers across the Inland Northwest were affected by the windstorm. “Once critical customers and transmission lines are restored, crews work to repair distribution feeder lines that serve larger groups of customers,” Avista said in a news release. “This will leave some customers … without power while', 'Power outages linger locally Thousands remain without power in the region following more wind and precipitation Thursday night.
