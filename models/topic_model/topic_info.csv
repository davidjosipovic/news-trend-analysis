The film, directed by Daniel Etim-Effiong, recently became available on Netflix. Its plot follows a couple whose wedding day in south-west Nigeria turns into a nightmare when their celebratory convoy is ambushed by gunmen disguised as cattle herders. The story quickly shifts from a joyous celebration to a brutal fight for survival. However, the movie’s central conflict has drawn significant criticism on the social media platform X. Prominent voices, including former presidential aide Bashir Ahmad, have condemned the film for what they call “a dangerous profiling of an ethnic group”. In a lengthy post, Ahmad argued that the scene depicting the attack “paints a picture that is dangerously inaccurate”. He expressed concern that the stereotyping fuels suspicion and violence against innocent Fulani people and could create an international stigma against the entire community. Ahmad concluded by calling on the Nigerian Film Corporation, led by Ali Nuhu, to investigate the film.

This uniquely dark color is not easy to produce and may appear less black when it is viewed at an angle. To find a better way to reproduce this cool color, a team at Cornell University looked to nature. Specifically, a bird called the magnificent riflebird. The result is the darkest known fabric ever created and it is detailed in a study recently published in the journal Nature Communications. The magnificent riflebird is a large songbird and member of the bird-of-paradise family found in New Guinea and Australia.

The blackout, which began late Thursday, affects major sports coverage, including college football games on Saturday and upcoming NBA, NFL, and NHL contests. YouTube TV, the largest U.S. internet TV provider with more than 9 million subscribers, warned viewers of the dispute for weeks through on-screen messages. YouTube TV’s parent company, Google, said Disney demanded higher fees that would drive up prices for subscribers. In a blog post updated just before midnight, YouTube accused Disney of yanking its channels to steer viewers toward its own streaming services, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo. “We know this is a frustrating and disappointing outcome for our subscribers and we continue to urge Disney to work with us constructively to reach a fair agreement that restores their networks to YouTube TV,” the company said, the Associated Press reported.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format.

This year's CES is indisputably the Micro RGB show.

Also: CES 2026 news: Live updates on TVs, smart glasses, robots, and more we've seen so far The brand's new crown jewel TV of 2026 is the X11L, which features TCL's Super Quantum Dot (SQD) Mini LED panel, for which the company claims achieves 100 percent of the BT2020 color gamut. This is accomplished by pairing the SQD layer with a CSOT UltraColor Filter, as well as an Advanced Color Purity Algorithm. If that assembly of tech jargon doesn't tell you it's CES (or that TCL means business), then I don't know what will. Effectively, the X11L solves a major pain point with conventional Micro RGB TVs: color blooming, or color crosstalk. With Micro RGB TVs often emitting very bright light, certain colors can bleed into surrounding dark areas, reducing color accuracy.

Osaka raised eyebrows when she entered the court for her first-round match against Antonia Ruzic sporting a unique pre-match look. She wore an ocean blue tie-dye tracksuit jacket and white wide-leg bottoms for the coin toss, along with a white umbrella. The jellyfish-inspired look was curated by fashion designer Robert Wun, who has previously worked on pieces worn by the likes of Beyonce, Cardi B and Ariana Grande. It came from a vision Osaka had while she was reading to her two-year-old daughter, Shai. Not everybody loved the outfit, though, with Jamie Murray and Eliza Wastcoat among those who weren\'t impressed.

One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history.
