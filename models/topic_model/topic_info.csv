The shade defined as a black that reflects less than 0.5 percent of the light that hits it, is used on everything from telescopes to cameras. This uniquely dark color is not easy to produce and may appear less black when it is viewed at an angle. To find a better way to reproduce this cool color, a team at Cornell University looked to nature. Specifically, a bird called the magnificent riflebird. The result is the darkest known fabric ever created and it is detailed in a study recently published in the journal Nature Communications. The magnificent riflebird is a large songbird and member of the bird-of-paradise family found in New Guinea and Australia. Male riflebirds are almost completely black, with a green and blue metallic sheen on their belly, throat, and crown feathers. With the help of Mary M.

Sabalenka served four aces in the final game of the first set alone and overall put 82.7% of her first serves in play.

On Saturday, Sabalenka was presented with a trophy for finishing the year at No. 1. “I’m super happy and super proud of the work that has been done and that things are working and I’m getting better and better every day,” she said. “And I just hope that we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and hopefully we can stay there.” The season-ending tournament for the year’s top eight players starts with two four-woman groups of round-robin play.

Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format. Pricing and availability are unknown for now; the full description provided by Samsung and CES is as follows: The Samsung OLED (S95H) is the world\'s most advanced 48"" OLED TV for high-end gaming.

This year's CES is indisputably the Micro RGB show. Virtually every major TV manufacturer is incorporating the tri-colored pixel technology, as if the transparent TVs from last year are no longer cutting-edge. TCL has other plans. Also: CES 2026 news: Live updates on TVs, smart glasses, robots, and more we've seen so far The brand's new crown jewel TV of 2026 is the X11L, which features TCL's Super Quantum Dot (SQD) Mini LED panel, for which the company claims achieves 100 percent of the BT2020 color gamut. This is accomplished by pairing the SQD layer with a CSOT UltraColor Filter, as well as an Advanced Color Purity Algorithm. If that assembly of tech jargon doesn't tell you it's CES (or that TCL means business), then I don't know what will. Effectively, the X11L solves a major pain point with conventional Micro RGB TVs: color blooming, or color crosstalk. With Micro RGB TVs often emitting very bright light, certain colors can bleed into surrounding dark areas, reducing color accuracy. With the CSOT UltraColor Filter, TCL has significantly reduced these artifacts, rendering images that, to my fresh-off-a-plane eyes, appeared c""]"

On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

On Wednesday, the Duke of Sussex was spotted taking part in the St. Regis World Snow Polo Championship in Aspen, Colorado, just hours after he was spotted skiing with close friend Nacho Figueras. The Prince, 41, reportedly was taking part in the polo tournament to stand in for a friend who couldn’t make it. He is believed to have been on the Aspen Valley team. Harry would have most likely been delighted to take part in the event, having played polo for a number of years.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming. While the King’s actions have been praised, some believe the monarch, 76, took too long to take action, especially over evicting the former prince from his Crown Estate mansion, however Queen Elizabeth's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson has now explained why.
