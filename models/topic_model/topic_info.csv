Jared Polis delivered his last State of the State to a joint session of the Colorado General Assembly on Thursday. In his speech, the Democratic governor called out Republicans, reflected on his past seven years in office, and looked to policy priorities for his last 10 months in office. Since the Trump administration took office one year ago, the Democrat-led Colorado state government has often faced off against the federal government over policies and funding cuts.

These screens can be useful for productivity on business trips or while traveling. But portable monitors that combine a high resolution with a fast refresh rate remain uncommon in the mid-range segment. Luckfox wants to address this gap with its new 16"" 4K Touch Monitor. The 16-inch display features a 3840 × 2400 (WQUXGA) IPS panel with 350 nits brightness and a 1200:1 contrast ratio. It uses optical bonding technology with 6H-hardness toughened glass and a matte finish to minimize ambient reflections. The 16:10 aspect ratio provides more vertical workspace than the standard 16:9 format. It also supports a 120Hz refresh rate, which is an upgrade over the common 60Hz panels found in many portable monitors, such as the Auzai ME16Z01 or the Arzopa A1M; response times aren\'t disclosed, though.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously.

A major part of the reforms is the restructuring of the national curriculum for basic, senior secondary and technical education, which commenced this academic year. The ministry had also added new vocational and trade subjects to the curriculum, including digital literacy, solar installation, agricultural entrepreneurship, and garment making. This is intended to entrench practical skills from an early age and prepare students for the demands of the modern job market. According to the minister, the total number of subjects a student would offer would be streamlined across different grade levels to reduce “content overload” and enable deeper learning.

On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

It turns out computer screens have the same effect at quieting the boredom for prisoners in the Nez Perce County Jail. “It has become a very good babysitter,” said NPC Deputy Kael Brink, 38, who was apologetic about the metaphor. “There is a change in inmate behavior.” One of Brink’s jobs is to monitor the use of tablets that are issued to inmates at the 165-capacity Nez Perce County Jail. On Oct. 1, the jail started issuing computer tablets for free to each inmate. These devices not only provide entertainment or educational viewing and listening — they have become how lawyers, loved ones and visitors communicate with inmates, officials say. While the technology is new to Nez Perce County, the Canyon County Jail in Caldwell introduced the tablets two years ago. Immediately, the tablets made the prison population more peaceful. “We saw a decline of 40% for disturbances and fights,” said Canyon County Sheriff’s Deputy Lt. Travis Engle. The rates for fights and disturbances have remained at the new lower level, and may have decreased more, Engle said.

Regulators cited concentrations of iodine and selenium above the levels they expect in products intended for infants, prompting the public-health action. The recall is part of a larger pressure on Nestlé’s infant-formula business that has already been under scrutiny. When a regulatory agency identifies mineral concentrations outside its safety thresholds for baby foods, the immediate priority is removing affected lots from store shelves and advising caregivers not to use those products until their pediatrician or local health authority provides guidance. What this means for parents and caregivers: Why it matters Infant formulas are regulated tightly because infants have limited ability to process excess minerals and because composition can directly affect growth and development. A recall over iodine and selenium levels can reduce the available pool of specialized formulas while regulators and the company investigate the cause and scope. Until more information is released about specific batches and the root cause, caregivers', 'Abbott Laboratories announces $21 billion deal to buy Cologuard-maker Exact Sciences Abbott Laboratories in Abbott Park on June 25, 2018.
