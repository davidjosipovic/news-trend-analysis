Fleur East, host of Strictly spin-off It Takes Two, has now verified that Alex will return to the competition following last week\'s Blackpool special.

On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming. While the King’s actions have been praised, some believe the monarch, 76, took too long to take action, especially over evicting the former prince from his Crown Estate mansion, however Queen Elizabeth's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson has now explained why.

The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice.
