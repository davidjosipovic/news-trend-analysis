Located just outside Cairo on the Giza Plateau which also includes the three pyramids and the Sphinx, the museum will be the world’s largest dedicated to a single civilization. It will display over 50,000 artifacts detailing life in ancient Egypt. World leaders, including monarchs, heads of states and governments, are set to attend the grand opening ceremony, according to the Egyptian presidency which touted the museum as “an exceptional event in the history of human culture and civilization.” The museum is one of the megaprojects championed by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi since he took office in 2014. He has embarked on massive investments in infrastructure with the aim of reviving an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered by the unrest that followed the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. Preparations for the grand reveal have been shrouded in secrecy. The museum, which was opened for limited visits in recent years, has been closed for the past two weeks.

This year's CES is indisputably the Micro RGB show. Virtually every major TV manufacturer is incorporating the tri-colored pixel technology, as if the transparent TVs from last year are no longer cutting-edge. TCL has other plans. Also: CES 2026 news: Live updates on TVs, smart glasses, robots, and more we've seen so far The brand's new crown jewel TV of 2026 is the X11L, which features TCL's Super Quantum Dot (SQD) Mini LED panel, for which the company claims achieves 100 percent of the BT2020 color gamut. This is accomplished by pairing the SQD layer with a CSOT UltraColor Filter, as well as an Advanced Color Purity Algorithm. If that assembly of tech jargon doesn't tell you it's CES (or that TCL means business), then I don't know what will. Effectively, the X11L solves a major pain point with conventional Micro RGB TVs: color blooming, or color crosstalk. With Micro RGB TVs often emitting very bright light, certain colors can bleed into surrounding dark areas, reducing color accuracy. With the CSOT UltraColor Filter, TCL has significantly reduced these artifacts, rendering images that, to my fresh-off-a-plane eyes, appeared c"", 'Samsung OLED 48S95H: New 48-inch and 165 Hz OLED TV revealed ahead of schedule with HDR10 Plus Advanced support Samsung has already teased plenty of devices on the eve of CES 2026. However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format. Pricing and availability are unknown for now; the full description provided by Samsung and CES is as follows: The Samsung OLED (S95H) is the world\'s most advanced 48"" OLED TV for high-end gaming.

The display is intended to deliver immersive experiences on both sides simultaneously, with built-in audio and dynamic lighting effects. TPV Technology Group, the company behind GP TV, claims the screen targets premium users who value high-end visual fidelity, as well as the public sector and government institutions. This design feels unusual because most monitors or televisions sit against a wall or on a desk, making a rear-facing display largely unnecessary. Its relevance only emerges if the screen stands in the center of a room, similar to display setups commonly seen in shopping malls - and even then, deploying such a device in public spaces would increase the risk of physical damage, leaving the practical use case for this product uncertain.
