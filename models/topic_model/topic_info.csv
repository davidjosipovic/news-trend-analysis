Different people are pointing at various things as the cause or causes of the Golden State Warriors\' struggles this season. Some say it\'s because they don\'t have a consistent second option behind Steph Curry. Others say it\'s because their young guys have not progressed as expected. While some believe it\'s Steve Kerr\'s coaching. Former Miami Heat captain Udonis Haslem thinks that the Dubs\' issues are rooted in the fact that they did not get what they were supposed to receive last offseason.

We all live in a 55+ community and have moved here from different areas of the country. We are a group of women who get together on a regular basis for outings. Over the past couple of months, I feel somewhat left out because of a couple of events I wasn’t included in. But what I’m trying to understand is why does she not “like” or comment on any of my Facebook posts when she’s all over everyone else’s with supportive and loving comments? Again, this is so silly, but I can’t help wondering why. When I look back at my posts, I noticed she has never acknowledged any of them, even for my birthday. We are still friends, we work with the same fundraising group, have dinner at each other’s house and get invited to the same events. This Facebook thing has got me confused and I don’t know what kind of friend she is so I’m getting uncomfortable around her. So now, what am I doing? Ignoring her posts, which makes me feel so stupid and juvenile. If I wasn’t part of this group, which I really like, I wouldn’t bother with her. Can you shed any light on her mindset? It’s really got me confused. – Friend Request Dear Friend: Even though social', 'Asking Eric: After 6 years sober, man is frustrated by his family’s hold on their hurt and distrust Dear Eric: I’ve just turned 40 this past year. The last 15 years I was in a horrible drug addiction. I lied and hurt and did terrible things to a lot of people, especially my family. About eight years ago they officially disowned me. Understandable. I’ve cleaned up and got my act together six years ago. At first, I tried to force my way back into their lives, which all refuted. I lashed out, said horrible things and stopped trying to be in their lives. My mom will stop by on my birthday for 10 minutes or so and drop a card off at Christmas. As for my two older brothers and my father, it’s radio silence. I guess what I’m asking is, what do I do to fix this and fast, as I said I’ve turned 40 this year, my parents are both 70. Time is running out, and I couldn’t imagine living my life without some kind of acceptance from my father. Or knowing he did or does love me. My heart breaks at the thought, but this is a real pickle. How can I fix a problem when the ones I need to fix it with won’t talk to me? Do I just keep ignoring their existence and put on this façade that I don’t care to my wife and 4-year-old son?

We did a special trip for his older brother when he turned 40 and would like to do something special for this son’s 40th as well. Our daughter-in-law has made special plans for him and we are not included. I understand that, but I need some ideas as to how to celebrate this extra special year without rocking the boat. I love my son with all my heart, as I do all my children, and want his 40th birthday to be memorable in a positive way. Any suggestions? – Mom Who Wants to Celebrate Dear Mom: The issues your son and your husband are having may be an obstacle, but they aren’t insurmountable. And the thing that can get them on the path to resolution is the same thing that can get you answers about how to celebrate your son: open communication.
