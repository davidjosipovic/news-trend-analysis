The film, directed by Daniel Etim-Effiong, recently became available on Netflix. Its plot follows a couple whose wedding day in south-west Nigeria turns into a nightmare when their celebratory convoy is ambushed by gunmen disguised as cattle herders. The story quickly shifts from a joyous celebration to a brutal fight for survival. However, the movie’s central conflict has drawn significant criticism on the social media platform X. Prominent voices, including former presidential aide Bashir Ahmad, have condemned the film for what they call “a dangerous profiling of an ethnic group”. In a lengthy post, Ahmad argued that the scene depicting the attack “paints a picture that is dangerously inaccurate”. He expressed concern that the stereotyping fuels suspicion and violence against innocent Fulani people and could create an international stigma against the entire community.

Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz both pitched for the Cleveland Guardians.

One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice. He was a unanimous choice by Baseball Writers’ Association of America voters. Ohtani’s achievements remain impossible to overstate.']"

He contends that critical delays in the Feed Ghana program are depriving farmers and the national economy of promised benefits. Ahiagbah argued the initiative, designed to enhance food security and provide farmer support, has failed to show meaningful progress. He expressed particular concern over the absence of promised buffer stock systems and market access for local producers. These shortcomings especially impact local rice farmers grappling with post harvest losses, he noted. The situation reportedly undermines confidence in the administration’s flagship strategy and hinders the sector’s potential for job creation and expanded production. Ahiagbah challenged the government to reaffirm its commitment to import substitution. He specifically urged authorities to bolster domestic capacity for rice production. “It would be a feather in the president’s cap to promote our local capacity,” Ahiagbah stated, advocating for political will to support Ghanaian growers over import cartels. He further emphasized that locally produced rice offers superior nutritional value', 'Vocational education key to unlocking Nigeria’s demographic dividends Nigeria is one of the youngest countries in the world, with over 70 percent of its population under the age of 25.

Virtually every major TV manufacturer is incorporating the tri-colored pixel technology, as if the transparent TVs from last year are no longer cutting-edge. TCL has other plans. Also: CES 2026 news: Live updates on TVs, smart glasses, robots, and more we've seen so far The brand's new crown jewel TV of 2026 is the X11L, which features TCL's Super Quantum Dot (SQD) Mini LED panel, for which the company claims achieves 100 percent of the BT2020 color gamut. This is accomplished by pairing the SQD layer with a CSOT UltraColor Filter, as well as an Advanced Color Purity Algorithm. If that assembly of tech jargon doesn't tell you it's CES (or that TCL means business), then I don't know what will. Effectively, the X11L solves a major pain point with conventional Micro RGB TVs: color blooming, or color crosstalk. With Micro RGB TVs often emitting very bright light, certain colors can bleed into surrounding dark areas, reducing color accuracy. With the CSOT UltraColor Filter, TCL has significantly reduced these artifacts, rendering images that, to my fresh-off-a-plane eyes, appeared c"", 'Samsung OLED 48S95H: New 48-inch and 165 Hz OLED TV revealed ahead of schedule with HDR10 Plus Advanced support Samsung has already teased plenty of devices on the eve of CES 2026. However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format. Pricing and availability are unknown for now; the full description provided by Samsung and CES is as follows: The Samsung OLED (S95H) is the world\'s most advanced 48"" OLED TV for high-end gaming.

The display is intended to deliver immersive experiences on both sides simultaneously, with built-in audio and dynamic lighting effects. TPV Technology Group, the company behind GP TV, claims the screen targets premium users who value high-end visual fidelity, as well as the public sector and government institutions. This design feels unusual because most monitors or televisions sit against a wall or on a desk, making a rear-facing display largely unnecessary. Its relevance only emerges if the screen stands in the center of a room, similar to display setups commonly seen in shopping malls - and even then, deploying such a device in public spaces would increase the risk of physical damage, leaving the practical use case for this product uncertain. It comes with an audio system that integrates surround sound, Dolby Atmos support, and sound tracking that follows on-screen action. Speakers with fabric covers on both sides creat""]"

One of them is Dairy Queen, which has decided to “bring” Taylor and Swift to the halftime show… no, not the pop star, but two football players who come together in a new promotion from the franchise. Here’s what it’s all about. ALSO READ Dairy Queen launches new Swicy menu: what’s included When preparations for Super Bowl LX began to be announced, there was a lot of speculation about Taylor Swift’s participation in the halftime show; however, the famous singer will not be taking the main stage at this event. Dairy Queen decided to take advantage of that buzz with a clever campaign, bringing together football players Tyrod Taylor and D’Andre Swift, whose last names form the name of the pop star.

The country star is headlining Turning Point USA’s conservative Super Bowl LX halftime show, which was put together as a protest against the official NFL show featuring Bad Bunny as the headliner on February 8. The even has of course had Vance plugging it as it was designed to appeal to the MAGA audience who did not feel comfortable with Bad Bunny performing in Spanish. Sharing a post about the alternative show on X Vance wrote, ""Fantastic lineup for the TPUSA halftime show, including the great Bob Ritchie AKA KID ROCK."" Viewers of the post were less than impressed by the vice president endorsing Kid Rock, especially in light of his 1997 song Daddy Cool resurfacing with some controversial lyrics. Set The Express as a \'Preferred Source\' to get quicker access to the news you value. Democratic Rep. Shri Thanedar pointed out the lyrics as he wrote, “This is who the Vice President is promoting.

The right is selectively freaking out over the Super Bowl Chris Martin, center, and Coldplay perform during halftime of Super Bowl 50, along with BeyoncÃ©, left, and Bruno Mars, at Levi's Stadium on Feb. 7, 2016, in Santa Clara, California. (Ezra Shaw/Getty Images/TNS) President Donald Trump told the New York Post that music artist Bad Bunny was a “terrible choice” to headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show and that the NFL’s selection of the Puerto Rican singer and rapper sows “hatred.” Department of Homeland Security adviser Corey Lewandowski suggested that Bad Bunny loathes the U.S. “It’s so shameful that they’ve decided to pick somebody who just seems to hate America so much to represent them at the halftime game,” he told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said on Monday that Bad Bunny disseminates “anti-American propaganda.” The upshot: Bad Bunny (aka Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) is an enemy of the state. An outsider who doesn’t possess American values. A Super Bowl wrecker. Heated debate around who is worthy to perform the halftime show is an American tradition (Prince, yes. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, no). But now, unsurprisingly, politics are part of that debate, so the mere fact that Bad Bu""]"
