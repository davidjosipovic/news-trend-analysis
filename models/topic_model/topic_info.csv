A 2-0 win against Albania on Sunday made it eight wins from eight for Thomas Tuchel's team, which also booked its place in next year's tournament without conceding a goal. England had already qualified before completing its final Group K match, but finished in style with another win. All-time leading scorer Harry Kane hit both goals in Tirana to extend his record to 78 goals in 112 games for his country. “We’ve set the standard now, especially in the last few camps,” the England captain told broadcaster ITV. “We're going to go into the tournament as one of the favourites. We have to accept that, it's been like that for the last few tournaments.” Kane's record in all competitions for Bayern Munich and England this season stands at 25 goals in 18 appearances. Tuchel was hired last year with the initial task of leading England into the World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format.

On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming.

Not everybody loved the outfit, though, with Jamie Murray and Eliza Wastcoat among those who weren\'t impressed. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Murray said: ""I felt there was an element of disrespect to the sport of tennis,"" while Wastcoat added: ""It looked a bit cheap, a little bit tacky."" It came after Wastcoat lasted Osaka\'s attire in a video on her Instagram account, saying: ""You are simply lying to yourself if you say you like Naomi Osaka\'s walk on outfit. ""You know what?

Sabalenka served four aces in the final game of the first set alone and overall put 82.7% of her first serves in play. The match, which was Sabalenka’s 500th at the WTA level, lasted 70 minutes. “I was focused, I was calm and it felt like everything was in control,” Sabalenka said. On Saturday, Sabalenka was presented with a trophy for finishing the year at No. 1. “I’m super happy and super proud of the work that has been done and that things are working and I’m getting better and better every day,” she said. “And I just hope that we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and hopefully we can stay there.” The season-ending tournament for the year’s top eight players starts with two four-woman groups of round-robin play. The top two finishers in each group advance to the semifinals. “I take this tournament as a regular tournament that I have to win five matches if I want to win the title,” Sabalenka said. “So I’m just trying to bring my best tennis and fight for every point.”']"

Yet the competition doesn't always go according to plan, with the BBC ballroom series having witnessed numerous surprising outcomes throughout its history. The 2009 series delivered one of the programme's most unexpected moments when Chris Hollins defied the odds to triumph over favourite Ricky Whittle. The victory surprised many, with the presenter later admitting he felt somewhat guilty about his win too. Hollyoaks actor Ricky, partnered with professional dancer Natalie Lowe, had regularly out-danced Chris, who performed alongside Ola Jordan. Nevertheless, Chris garnered substantial support from the viewing public and whilst he wasn't receiving the highest judges' scores, he consistently progressed through public votes, never facing elimination in the dance-off. Ultimately, he claimed victory, reports Wales Online. Prior to the finale, Chris acknowledged feeling a little guilty about reaching the last stage instead of Ali Bastian and Brian Fortuna, who had achieved better scor"", 'Strictly Come Dancing fans have same complaint as La Voix withdraws from show \'Pointless!\' Strictly Come Dancing fans have been left with the same question after it was announced La Voix has withdrawn from the competition.

But this has left fans wondering why Sunday night\'s show is still airing now that there is no dance-off.
