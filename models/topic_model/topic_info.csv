(AP) — “Rental Family” is Brendan Fraser’s first leading role since winning the best actor Oscar for “The Whale.” In it, the 56-year-old plays a struggling actor living in Japan who, out of desperation and curiosity, takes a job with an agency that hires out actors to fulfill roles in real people’s lives. In an interview, Fraser discusses his life since the Oscar win, his eye-opening experiences in Japan and what returning to the “Mummy” series means to him. His time in Japan included a visit to a hedgehog cafe. “Rental Family” opens Friday in theaters.

Their “lovely” garden in Grantham featured on the show as Alan and his co-stars Katie Rushworth, David Domoney and Frances Tophill tried to transform it into something inspired by The Secret Garden. Initially, the space featured a large lawn area with a shed and concrete paving stones, surrounded by lush trees and greenery. Afterwards, it was transformed into a floral haven complete with a faux-ruined stone wall, stone paving stones leading in paths around the flowers, and wooden trellises around the side of the house.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format.

On Thursday evening, it was revealed that Andrew, who has recently been stripped of all his royal titles as a result of scandals surrounding his past friendship with Epstein, has now been asked to give evidence in the US. Andrew has always denied any allegations made against him. While this has led to mixed public reaction, one public figure has said that if this is the case for Andrew, Prince Harry should also be asked to testify before Congress in the US about his visa. This is because over recent years, think tank group The Heritage Foundation have repeatedly asked for Harry’s US visa to be made public to see if he lied about his past drug use. This is because Harry has lived in America since 2020, but revealed in his 2023 memoir that he took drugs as a teenager.

While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming.
