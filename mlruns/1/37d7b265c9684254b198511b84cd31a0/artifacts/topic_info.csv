The last year was one to forget for Greggs‘ (LSE:GRG) shareholders. But there are two big questions investors need to ask. One is whether the underlying business is 40% worse than it was a year ago. The other is whether the stock’s worth considering right now. At first sight, 2025 didn’t look like a bad year for Greggs the business. The firm had more stores and revenues climbed around 6.7% during the first nine months of the year. Under the surface though, there are two issues. The first is the majority of the sales growth had been driven by new store openings – without this, sales growth had been more like 2.2%. That’s below inflation. And this raises concerns about how long the company’s going to be able to keep generating sales growth by opening new stores. The second issue is that the firm’s operating income had actually fallen during this time as a result of higher costs weighing on margins', 'Adams Wealth Management Has $2.71 Million Stake in Schwab US Broad Market ETF $SCHB Posted by Defense World Staff on Dec 15th, 2025 Adams Wealth Management increased its holdings in shares of Schwab US Broad Market ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHB – Free Report) by 26.5% in the second quarter, according to the company in its most recent Form 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Health care providers for decades have measured blood levels of the molecule creatinine to track the rate at which kidneys filter waste from muscle breakdown in the bloodstream. According to more recent guidelines, levels of cystatin C, a small protein made by all cells in the body, can also be used to measure kidney function. Since these two tests are influenced by different factors — including some related to disease or aging — using both markers together can provide a better measure of kidney function and risk of organ failure than either one alone. Led by NYU Langone Health researchers, the new work reveals that many people, especially those who are sick, often have a large gap between the two readings, which may be a signal of future disease. Specifically, the global study shows that more than a third of hospitalized participants had a cystatin C-based readout of kidney function that was at least 30% lower than one based on their creatinine levels.

Sabalenka served four aces in the final game of the first set alone and overall put 82.7% of her first serves in play. The match, which was Sabalenka’s 500th at the WTA level, lasted 70 minutes. “I was focused, I was calm and it felt like everything was in control,” Sabalenka said. On Saturday, Sabalenka was presented with a trophy for finishing the year at No. 1. “I’m super happy and super proud of the work that has been done and that things are working and I’m getting better and better every day,” she said. “And I just hope that we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and hopefully we can stay there.” The season-ending tournament for the year’s top eight players starts with two four-woman groups of round-robin play. The top two finishers in each group advance to the semifinals. “I take this tournament as a regular tournament that I have to win five matches if I want to win the title,” Sabalenka said. “So I’m just trying to bring my best tennis and fight for every point.”', ""Andrew Tate running away from Jake Paul fight - 'I'm not ready' Andrew Tate made his feelings clear about the probability of getting into the boxing ring with fellow social media star Jake Paul.

Tate, a controversial influencer, took to social media after losing to Chase DeMoor by decision on Saturday’s Misfits Boxing event in Dubai. “I’m not ready for Jake,” Tate posted on X. “Time is the fire in which we all burn. Fighting is for young men.” Tate, 39, seemingly wants no part of the 28-year-old YouTuber-turned-boxer, or any boxer for that matter, after he was roughed up by DeMoor in his Misfits debut on Saturday.

This milestone reflects broad-based support from key sectors. Coal remained the largest contributor at 505 MT, followed by iron ore (115 MT), cement (92 MT), container traffic (59 MT), pig iron &amp; finished steel (47 MT), fertilisers (42 MT), mineral oil (32 MT), foodgrains (30 MT), raw materials for steel plants (approx. 20 MT), and balance-other-goods (74 MT), as of November 19. Daily loading continues to hold strong at around 4.4 MT, higher than 4.2 MT last year, demonstrating improved operational efficiency and sustained demand, the ministry informed.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming. While the King’s actions have been praised, some believe the monarch, 76, took too long to take action, especially over evicting the former prince from his Crown Estate mansion, however Queen Elizabeth's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson has now explained why.

Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz both pitched for the Cleveland Guardians.

Thursday night’s crowning of Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees as this year’s National League and American League most valuable players offered a reminder of its rarity. One race yielded as tough a call as anyone can remember, with another huge season from one of the greatest hitters of the century in Judge pitted against what might have been the best all-around season ever by a catcher from Cal Raleigh. The other race was over almost as soon as Ohtani stepped on a major league pitching mound in June, provided he stayed healthy. He has won four MVP awards in the past five seasons and three straight since 2023. He is alone behind only Barry Bonds, who won seven, for the most MVP awards in MLB history. Last year, Ohtani joined Frank Robinson as the only player to win an MVP award in both leagues. This year, Ohtani became the first player to win the award in both leagues twice. He was a unanimous choice by Baseball Writers’ Association of America voters.

The Bombers need a center fielder with Trent Grisham and Bellinger on the market. Will they make sure one of them returns? Will they lose both, choose not to spend aggressively and raise the curtain on prospect Spencer Jones after a 35-homer, 25-steal season in the minors? The Yankees also need relievers.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously. Moreover, the new 48-inch Smart TV will support Samsung\'s new HDR10 Plus Advanced format. Pricing and availability are unknown for now; the full description provided by Samsung and CES is as follows: The Samsung OLED (S95H) is the world\'s most advanced 48"" OLED TV for high-end gaming.
