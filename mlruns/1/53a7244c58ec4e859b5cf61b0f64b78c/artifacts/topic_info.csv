Odigie-Oyegun made the remarks on Monday in Benin City, Edo State, during a formal reception for members of the Obidient Movement who recently defected en masse to the ADC. The defection follows the recent alignment of former Labour Party presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi, with the ADC. Addressing the gathering, Odigie-Oyegun said the decision by the Obidient Movement to join the ADC reflects a growing commitment among Nigerians, especially young people, to pursue political change and national renewal. “The calibre and dedication of new members joining our party strengthens my belief that a new Nigeria is within reach,” he said.

He contends that critical delays in the Feed Ghana program are depriving farmers and the national economy of promised benefits. Ahiagbah argued the initiative, designed to enhance food security and provide farmer support, has failed to show meaningful progress. He expressed particular concern over the absence of promised buffer stock systems and market access for local producers. These shortcomings especially impact local rice farmers grappling with post harvest losses, he noted. The situation reportedly undermines confidence in the administration’s flagship strategy and hinders the sector’s potential for job creation and expanded production. Ahiagbah challenged the government to reaffirm its commitment to import substitution. He specifically urged authorities to bolster domestic capacity for rice production. “It would be a feather in the president’s cap to promote our local capacity,” Ahiagbah stated, advocating for political will to support Ghanaian growers over import cartels.

Never before had Ukraine faced such a large number of ballistic missiles in a single attack. The Russians targeted state-owned and private power plants, high-voltage substations belonging to Ukrenergo, Ukraine\'s state-owned electricity transmission operator, and oil and gas industry facilities. The most devastating losses were suffered by Centrenergo, a major state-owned energy company, which lost all its generating capacity. Both of its thermal power plants – Trypillia in Kyiv Oblast and Zmiivska in Kharkiv Oblast – have been completely shut down. ""It\'s been less than a month since the previous strike, and last night the enemy hit all our generating capacity. The plants are on fire. We have stopped. Energy generation is now at zero,"" Centrenergo said. Strikes on substations near nuclear power plants are particularly alarming. The latest attack damaged facilities near the Khmelnytskyi and Rivne nuclear power plants. The following morning, the consequences of the large-scale attack were being felt across the country: electricity shortages, emergency power cuts and', ""Bulgaria names manager to take over Russia's Lukoil refinery after US sanctions A parliamentary vote authorised the government to seize Lukoil's assets in the country Bulgaria on Friday nominated a senior government official to take control of a major Lukoil refinery in the east of the country following US sanctions against the Russian oil giant.

Sabalenka served four aces in the final game of the first set alone and overall put 82.7% of her first serves in play. The match, which was Sabalenka’s 500th at the WTA level, lasted 70 minutes. “I was focused, I was calm and it felt like everything was in control,” Sabalenka said. On Saturday, Sabalenka was presented with a trophy for finishing the year at No. 1. “I’m super happy and super proud of the work that has been done and that things are working and I’m getting better and better every day,” she said. “And I just hope that we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and hopefully we can stay there.” The season-ending tournament for the year’s top eight players starts with two four-woman groups of round-robin play.

The shade defined as a black that reflects less than 0.5 percent of the light that hits it, is used on everything from telescopes to cameras. This uniquely dark color is not easy to produce and may appear less black when it is viewed at an angle. To find a better way to reproduce this cool color, a team at Cornell University looked to nature. Specifically, a bird called the magnificent riflebird. The result is the darkest known fabric ever created and it is detailed in a study recently published in the journal Nature Communications. The magnificent riflebird is a large songbird and member of the bird-of-paradise family found in New Guinea and Australia. Male riflebirds are almost completely black, with a green and blue metallic sheen on their belly, throat, and crown feathers. With the help of Mary M. Ferraro and Vanya Rohwer from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the team studied the riflebird’s black feathers.

Tracy Fisher, president of the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association, says drugs for animals — from cats and dogs to sheep and cattle — are becoming increasingly unavailable. She says Canadian regulations discourage drug manufacturers from going through the process to get their medications approved for distribution, even though the medicines are available in other countries. Animal welfare issues arise when veterinarians have fewer drugs at their disposal, she adds. “If you have an animal suffering from a disease and you can’t treat it, but your colleagues across the border or everywhere else can, that’s incredibly frustrating,” Fisher said in a recent interview. A lack of medications can also affect the food system, she said. For example, a new drug to treat dairy cows may not be available in Canada, resulting in veterinarians using an older, less effective medication. “(The cow) may not be able to be part of the milk supply system during that time,” Fisher said. “Worst-case scenario, the farmer loses t', ""Expert reveals the five dog breeds to avoid - 1 is top family favourite Choosing the right dog breed can be both thrilling and overwhelming.

Buckingham Palace made the announcement on Thursday after weeks of Andrew dominating the headlines as a result of scandals involving his past friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has always denied all accusations against him, the King’s brother was aware of how he was being a distraction to the monarchy, and on October 17 said he would no longer use his royal titles. However, King Charles took this a step further by formally removing them from him - a move that many did not see coming.

However, the trade show has decided to lift the lid on one of Samsung\'s forthcoming OLED Smart TVs. For context, Samsung listed numerous unreleased Smart TVs on its Parts Database over a month ago. Of those, CES has announced that the S95H is a 2026 Honoree in its Gaming & eSports category. Specifically, the trade show has signalled out a 48-inch variant that was missing from November\'s leak. Incidentally, last year\'s S95F only went as small as 55-inches (curr. $1,997 on Amazon). According to the listing, the S95H offers a 165 Hz refresh rate with VRR technology supported. Assuming a 4K resolution from the S95F series and the usage of HDMI 2.1 ports, a 165 Hz refresh rate would require the usage of Display Stream Compression (DSC) to output at its peak resolution and refresh rate simultaneously.
