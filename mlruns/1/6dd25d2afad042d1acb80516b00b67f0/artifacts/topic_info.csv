My husband and I have plenty of things, we don’t need any things or clothing or food. In the past the family members have all planned lists. There are children that will get gifts from Santa but how do we tell the rest of the fairly large family that enough is enough? – Realistic Gift-Giving Dear Gift-Giving: Meet their lists with a list of your own. You can make a list of charities you’d like them to contribute to in lieu of gifts, or a list of gifts that can’t be bought, like quality time or homemade treats. Or your list can have just one item: “we have everything we could want. All we ask for is your continued love and support.” Dear Eric: This is in response to “Walking Seniors,” whose neighbor would turn the sprinkler on them when they walked by his house.

Health care providers for decades have measured blood levels of the molecule creatinine to track the rate at which kidneys filter waste from muscle breakdown in the bloodstream. According to more recent guidelines, levels of cystatin C, a small protein made by all cells in the body, can also be used to measure kidney function. Since these two tests are influenced by different factors — including some related to disease or aging — using both markers together can provide a better measure of kidney function and risk of organ failure than either one alone. Led by NYU Langone Health researchers, the new work reveals that many people, especially those who are sick, often have a large gap between the two readings, which may be a signal of future disease. Specifically, the global study shows that more than a third of hospitalized participants had a cystatin C-based readout of kidney function that was at least 30% lower than one based on their creatinine levels.

The film, directed by Daniel Etim-Effiong, recently became available on Netflix. Its plot follows a couple whose wedding day in south-west Nigeria turns into a nightmare when their celebratory convoy is ambushed by gunmen disguised as cattle herders. The story quickly shifts from a joyous celebration to a brutal fight for survival. However, the movie’s central conflict has drawn significant criticism on the social media platform X. Prominent voices, including former presidential aide Bashir Ahmad, have condemned the film for what they call “a dangerous profiling of an ethnic group”. In a lengthy post, Ahmad argued that the scene depicting the attack “paints a picture that is dangerously inaccurate”. He expressed concern that the stereotyping fuels suspicion and violence against innocent Fulani people and could create an international stigma against the entire community. Ahmad concluded by calling on the Nigerian Film Corporation, led by Ali Nuhu, to investigate the film. The reason why some Arewa people are angry about The Her', 'Insecurity: Kefas Shuts Down Boarding Schools In Taraba Taraba State Governor, Agbu Kefas, has ordered all secondary schools both public and private to immediately send their boarding students home following heightened security threats across the country.

She stated that the rising wave of insecurity has made boarding students vulnerable to targeted attacks by bandits, citing the recent abductions of schoolgirls in Kebbi and Niger states as worrying indicators. READ ALSO: According to Dr. Godwin, Kefas has now directed that all secondary schools in the state operate strictly as day schools until security conditions improve.
